That said, the fact that, by all accounts, your idol has been missing since House Thrune instituted martial law has you worried; you hope he or she is all right! The fact that all five of the local legends listed below have been rumored to have ties to the Silver Ravens further concerns you, considering how that group seems to have been particularly targeted by Barzillai Thrune&rsquo;s agents over the past week.

This equipment package is suitable for clerics, druids, inquisitors, oracles, and paladins. The specific gear is appropriate for those visiting the chaotic evil Abyss but can be adjusted to suit other evilaligned planes, such as swapping the scrolls of protection from chaos for scrolls of protection from law for a package designed for travel to Hell.</p><p><strong>Armor</strong>: Masterwork chain shirt.</p><p><strong>Weapons</strong>: Cold iron shortspear, light crossbow with 20 crossbow bolts.</p><p><strong>Combat Gear</strong>: Holy water (3), <em>scrolls of cure light wounds</em> (2), <em>scrolls of protection from chaos</em> (2), <em>scrolls of protection from evil</em> (2), <em>scroll of remove curse</em>.</p><p><strong>Other Gear</strong>: Backpack, bedroll, candles (5), chalk (5 pieces), crowbar, ioun torch, mess kit, shovel, silk rope (50 ft.), spell component pouch, trail rations (5 days), waterskin, wooden holy symbol, 13 gp.</p><p><strong>Total Weight</strong>: 74 lbs.

(48-1/2 lbs. for a Small character).</p><hr /><p><strong>Daring Bravo Package</strong></p><p>The daring bravo is equally adept in social situations and combat, with the right equipment to move fluidly from one to the other. Such adventurers are known as much for their flair and panache as their martial prowess, and the daring bravo&rsquo;s equipment is often ornately ornamented or personalized. This equipment package is good for a bard, fighter, rogue, swashbuckler, or vigilante. Certain cavaliers, investigators, skalds, or even paladins may also find it appealing. If the PC can cast spells, add a spell component pouch.</p><p><strong>Armor</strong>: Masterwork chain shirt.</p><p><strong>Weapons</strong>: Light crossbow with 10 bolts, masterwork rapier, sap, alchemical silver dagger.</p><p><strong>Combat Gear</strong>: Acid (2), alchemist&rsquo;s kindness, <em>potions of cure light wounds</em> (2), sunrods (3).</p><p><strong>Other Gear</strong>: Backpack, bedroll, belt pouch, bottle of fine wine, chalk (5 pieces), courtier&rsquo;s outfit with 50 gp in jewelry, flask, flint and steel, grooming kit, masterwork musical instrument, mess kit, mirror, perfume or cologne, sack, signet ring, silk rope (50 ft.), trail rations (5 days), waterskin, whetstone, 5 gp.</p><p><strong>Total Weight</strong>: 76-1/2 lbs.

This equipment package is well-suited to a cleric, inquisitor, paladin, warpriest, or even a fighter with a religious background. It&rsquo;s especially suited to characters who focus on supporting their party members and making them more effective in a fight. Even more than with other equipment packages, the GM should consider substituting the masterwork longsword in this package with a masterwork melee weapon appropriate to the PC&rsquo;s faith. If the PC can cast spells, add a spell component pouch.</p><p><strong>Armor</strong>: Heavy steel shield, masterwork breastplate.</p><p><strong>Weapons</strong>: Cold iron morningstar, heavy crossbow with 10 bolts, masterwork longsword.</p><p><strong>Combat Gear</strong>: Alchemist&rsquo;s fire (3), holy water (4), <em>oil of bless weapon</em>, <em>potions of cure light wounds</em> (2), <em>potion of protection from evil</em>, sunrods (3).</p><p><strong>Other Gear</strong>: Backpack, bedroll, belt pouch, candles (5), chalk (5 pieces), crowbar, flint and steel, holy symbol (silver), mess kit, sack, silk rope (50 ft.), trail rations (5 days), waterskin, 7 gp.</p><p><strong>Total Weight</strong>: 102 lbs. (57-1/4 lbs. for a Small character).</p><hr /><p><strong>Lore Seeker Package</strong></p><p>The lore seeker has the equipment necessary to delve into ancient ruins searching for lost knowledge.

(42-1/2 lbs. for a Small character).</p><hr /><p><strong>Questing Knight Package</strong></p><p>If not descended from nobility, the questing knight certainly looks like he fits the part. This equipment package is useful for cavaliers, fighters, and paladins. If the PC can cast spells, add a spell component pouch and a holy symbol (if required). If the PC gains a mount from a class feature, remove the horse from the list below and replace the lance with a masterwork lance.</p><p><strong>Armor</strong>: Half-plate, heavy wooden shield.</p><p><strong>Weapons</strong>: Javelins (4), lance, longsword.</p><p><strong>Combat Gear</strong>: Sunrods (2).</p><p><strong>Other Gear</strong>: Backpack, banner, bedroll, belt pouch, flask, flint and steel, mess kit, pole (10 ft.), sack, shovel, signet ring, silk rope (50 ft.), trail rations (5 days), waterskin, whetstone, 8 gp.</p><p><strong>Mount</strong>: Heavy horse (combat trained) with bit and bridle, military saddle, and saddlebags.</p><p><strong>Total Weight</strong>: 127-1/2 lbs.

(33-1/4 lbs. for a Small character).</p><hr /><p><strong>Wilderness Wanderer Package</strong></p><p>This equipment package is appropriate for any lightly-armored combatant in the wild, such as a barbarian, hunter, or ranger. If the PC can cast spells, add a spell component pouch and holly and mistletoe. The GM might consider altering which weapon is masterwork, based on the PC&rsquo;s specialization. For example, an archery-focused ranger might prefer a masterwork composite longbow over a masterwork greataxe.</p><p><strong>Armor</strong>: Light wooden quickdraw shield, masterwork studded leather armor.</p><p><strong>Weapons</strong>: Cold iron flail, composite longbow with 20 arrows, masterwork greataxe, short sword.</p><p><strong>Combat Gear</strong>: Alchemist&rsquo;s fire (2), antitoxin, <em>potion of keen senses</em>, sunrods (3).</p><p><strong>Other Gear</strong>: Backpack, bedroll, belt pouch, chalk (5 pieces), climber&rsquo;s kit, cold-weather outfit, fishhook, flint and steel, mess kit, pole (10 ft.), shovel, signal whistle, silk rope (50 ft.), trail rations (5 days), waterskin, 2 sp.</p><p><strong>Total Weight</strong>: 108-1/2 lbs.
