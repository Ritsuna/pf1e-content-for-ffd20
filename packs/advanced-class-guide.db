Some serve their code by ridding the world of dangers on the roads and byways, while others protect the faithful and their institutions.</p><h1>HOLY GUIDE (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>A holy guide believes he has a sacred calling to clear the roads of bandits between towns as well as to escort travelers to safety. He must enforce the rule of law in the wilderness and help those that cannot defend themselves against the many dangers of the area.</p><p><b>Class Skills</b>: A holy guide gains Knowledge (geography) and Survival as class skills.</p><p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, a holy guide chooses a favored terrain from the ranger favored terrains table. This ability otherwise functions as the ranger class feature of the same name. This ability replaces the mercy gained at 3rd level. Every time a holy guide would be able to select another mercy, he can instead select another favored terrain and increase his bonuses for one existing favored terrain, just as a ranger can.</p><p><b>Teamwork Feat (Ex)</b>: At 6th level, a holy guide gains a teamwork feat as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat. As a standard action, he can expend one use of smite evil to grant this feat to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear him. Allies retain the use of this bonus feat for 3 rounds plus 1 round for every 2 paladin levels the holy guide possesses. Allies do not need to meet the prerequisites of this bonus feat. Evil creatures do not gain the benefit of this teamwork feat, even if the paladin considers them allies. This ability replaces the mercy gained at 6th level.</p><h1>TEMPLE CHAMPION (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>A temple champion is a powerful warrior dedicated to a good or lawful deity. She thinks of herself primarily as a servant of her deity and secondarily as an agent of her deity's church. She has a refined understanding of a specific aspect of that faith and gives up standard paladin spellcasting in favor of a warpriest's domain-based blessings and granted powers.</p><p><b>Spells</b>: A temple champion does not gain access to paladin spells, and does not have a paladin caster level or a spell list. This is not considered a spellcasting class.</p><p><b>Domain Granted Power</b>: At 4th level, a temple champion selects one domain granted by her deity (or a domain suitable for her ethos or goals, subject to GM discretion).</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>The temple champion gains the 1st-level granted power of that domain and uses her paladin level as her cleric level for determining the effects of that granted power. Any Wisdom-based aspects of that granted power instead use the temple champion's Charisma. The temple champion does not gain access to that domain's spell list.</p><p><b>Blessing (Su)</b>: At 5th level, a temple champion gains the minor blessing (as the warpriest class feature) of the domain she selected at 4th level. She uses her paladin level as her warpriest level for determining the effects of that blessing. Any Wisdom-based aspects of that blessing instead use the temple champion's Charisma. At 11th level, she gains the major blessing of her chosen domain. This ability replaces divine bond and aura of justice.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"02QpMoGkWd1xQtdU"}

Additionally, if the assassination attempt is successful, the target is decapitated instead of merely slain.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><tr><td>CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS</td></tr><p><b>COST</b> 7,100 GP</p><p>Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <i>keen edge</i>, <i>slay living</i></p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>RAPIER OF BATTLEFIELD MOVEMENT</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>PRICE</b> 30,320 GP <b>SLOT</b> none<b> CL</b>7th <b>WEIGHT</b>2 lbs.</p><p><b>AURA</b>moderate transmutation</p><p>This <i>+2 rapier</i>has elegant lines and a stylish basket hilt.

Yet while the constraints of heredity or circumstance might taint a bloodline in a particular manner, other factors allow a great deal of diversity among bloodragers. Some have learned fighting disciplines that allow arcane energies to seep through the skin during violent contact, while others can summon creatures that benefit from the rage tied to the bloodrager's own blood.</p><p>The following are varieties of bloodragers that can manifest regardless of bloodlines.</p><h1>BLOOD CONDUIT (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Blood conduits learn to channel their arcane might directly through their flesh, without the need for mystical words or gestures.</p><p><b>Contact Specialist (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a blood conduit selects a bonus feat from the following: Improved Bull Rush, Improved Grapple, Improved Reposition, Improved Trip, or Improved Unarmed Strike. He does not need to meet the prerequisites to take this feat. He also adds the feats above to his list of bloodline feats. This ability replaces fast movement and alters bloodline feats.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Spell Conduit (Su)</b>: At 5th level, as long as a blood conduit is wearing light armor or no armor, he can deliver bloodrager spells with a range of touch through bodily contact.</p><p>When he succeeds at a combat maneuver check to bull rush, grapple, pin, reposition, or trip an opponent, or makes an unarmed strike against an enemy, he can as a swift action cast a touch spell on the creature, requiring no further touch attack roll. If this spell would usually require a successful touch attack, his successful combat maneuver check or unarmed strike counts as this attack. This ability replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.</p><p><b>Reflexive Conduit (Ex)</b>: At 14th level, a blood conduit can discharge his power into foes that attempt bodily contact with him. While wearing light armor or no armor, when the blood conduit is subject to a combat maneuver check made to bull rush, grapple, pin, reposition, or trip him, as an immediate action he can target his attacker with a bloodrager spell that has a range of touch. If the spell would normally require a touch attack, a blood conduit can attempt a combat maneuver check for this attack instead. This ability replaces indomitable will.</p><h1>BLOODRIDER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>In the world's wild lands, a mount is an advantage in both everyday life and the dealing of death. In many barbarian tribes, the true stature of a warrior is determined by his skill and ferocity when fighting astride his mount. A number of bloodragers not only are skilled in the art of mounted combat, but have learned to channel their arcane energies directly into their mounts.</p><p><b>Fast Rider (Ex)</b>: The bloodrider is adept at pushing his mount to its limit. The speed of any mount that the bloodrager rides increases by 10 feet. This ability replaces fast movement.</p><p><b>Feral Mount (Ex)</b>: At 5th level, the bloodrider gains the service of a feral mount. This ability functions as the druid's animal companion, using the bloodrager's level - 4 as his effective druid level. This companion must be one he is capable of riding and suitable as a mount. A Medium bloodrider can select a camel or a horse. A Small bloodrider can select a pony or a wolf, and can also select a boar or a riding dog if he is at least 8th level. Whenever a bloodrider is bloodraging, this feral mount gains a +2 morale bonus to its Strength. This ability replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.</p><p><b>Blood Bond (Su)</b>: At 9th level, the bloodrider and his feral mount gain a closer bond that allows the bloodrider to augment his mount based on his bloodline. While the bloodrider is bloodraging and on his feral mount, he grants the mount all the immunities and resistances he gains from bloodline powers. Furthermore, whenever the bloodrager is affected by a spell or a spell-like ability with a range of personal while on the feral mount, the feral mount also gains the benefit of that spell. This ability replaces the bloodline feat gained at 9th level.</p><h1>CROSSBLOODED RAGER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>While most bloodragers manifest only one bloodline, there are some who, through some quirk of heredity or the conjunction of other powers, manifest two. This combination of two distinct bloodlines can create a versatile and powerful rager who stands out among the horde.</p><p>A crossblooded rager selects two different bloodlines. He gains access to the feats, bonus spells, and some of the powers of both bloodlines he is descended from, but at the cost of reducing mental clarity (see Drawbacks, below). If the crossblooded rager already has a bloodline from another class, one of the chosen bloodlines must be that bloodline.</p><p><b>Bonus Feats</b>: A crossblooded rager combines the bonus feat lists from both of his bloodlines and can select his bloodline bonus feats from this combined list.</p><p><b>Bloodline Spells</b>: A crossblooded rager can select his bloodline spells from either of his bloodlines. He can also learn a lower-level bloodline spell he did not choose in place of a higher-level bloodline spell he would normally gain. Lower-level bloodline spells learned in this manner are always the spell level that they would be if the crossblooded rager had learned them with the appropriate bloodline spell.</p><p>For example, a 7th-level aberrant/abyssal crossblooded rager has the choice of learning <i>enlarge person</i>or <i>ray of enfeeblement</i>as his bloodline spell. If he selected <i>ray of enfeeblement</i>as his 7th-level bloodline spell, at 10th level he could use his new bloodline spell to learn <i>enlarge person</i>instead of <i>bull's strength</i>or <i>see invisibility</i>, and he would add it to his list of 1st-level spells known ( just as if he had learned it as his 7th-level bloodline spell).</p><p><b>Bloodline Powers</b>: At 1st, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th levels, a crossblooded rager gains one of the two new bloodline powers available to him at that level. He can instead select a lower-level bloodline power he did not choose in place of one of these high-level powers.</p><p><b>Drawbacks</b>: The furious mix of arcane power inside a crossblooded rager forces him to constantly expend mental effort to remain focused on his current situation and needs. This leaves him with less mental resolve available to deal with external threats. A crossblooded rager takes a -2 penalty to all Will saving throws at all times, and does not gain the +2 morale bonus on Will saving throws while bloodraging-though he does gain a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws when he gains the greater bloodrage class feature, which increases to a +2 morale bonus when he gains the mighty bloodrage class feature.</p><h1>GREENRAGER (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Typically, nature finds its greatest harmony with divine magic, but sometimes a connection with the natural world manifests itself through the arcane current in the veins of the bloodragers called greenragers. These bloodragers funnel their eldritch heritage into abilities that allow them to call powerful allies from nature and empower them with their bloodrage.</p><p><b>Unfettered Fury (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, a greenrager's fury allows him to move through undergrowth with frightening speed and grace. This functions as the druid's woodland stride class feature, but only while the greenrager is bloodraging. This ability replaces blood sanctuary.</p><p><b>Summoning Rager (Sp)</b>: At 6th level, a greenrager's magic unlocks the secrets of summoning allies from nature. He adds <i>summon nature's ally I</i>to his list of 1st-level bloodrager spells known as a bonus spell, as if it were a bonus bloodrager spell. At 7th level, he adds <i>summon nature's ally II</i>as a bonus 2nd-level bloodrager spell, at 10th level he adds <i>summon nature's ally III</i>as a bonus 3rd-level bloodrager spell, and at 13th level he adds <i>summon nature's ally IV</i>as a bonus 4th-level bloodrager spell. This ability replaces the bloodline feat gained at 6th level.</p><p><b>Furious Summoning (Su)</b>: At 9th level, creatures summoned by the bloodrager's <i>summon nature's ally</i>spell gain a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and gain the druid's woodland stride ability. At 11th level, this bonus increases to +6. At 20th level, it increases to +8. This ability replaces the bloodline feat gained at 9th level.</p><h1>METAMAGIC RAGER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>While metamagic is difficult for many bloodragers to utilize, a talented few are able to channel their bloodrage in ways that push their spells to impressive ends.</p><p><b>Meta-Rage (Su)</b>: At 5th level, a metamagic rager can sacrifice additional rounds of bloodrage to apply a metamagic feat he knows to a bloodrager spell. This costs a number of rounds of bloodrage equal to twice what the spell's adjusted level would normally be with the metamagic feat applied (minimum 2 rounds). The metamagic rager does not have to be bloodraging to use this ability. The metamagic bloodrider can select a camel or a horse. A Small bloodrider can select a pony or a wolf, and can also select a boar or a riding dog if he is at least 8th level. Whenever a bloodrider is bloodraging, this feral mount gains a +2 morale bonus to its Strength. This ability replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.</p><p><b>Blood Bond (Su)</b>: At 9th level, the bloodrider and his feral mount gain a closer bond that allows the bloodrider to augment his mount based on his bloodline. While the bloodrider is bloodraging and on his feral mount, he grants the mount all the immunities and resistances he gains from bloodline powers. Furthermore, whenever the bloodrager is affected by a spell or a spell-like ability with a range of personal while on the feral mount, the feral mount also gains the benefit of that spell. This ability replaces the bloodline feat gained at 9th level.</p><h1>PRIMALIST (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>While bloodline powers come from the very essence of a bloodrager's being and are often strict and immutable, some bloodragers tap into ancient traditions and primitive wisdom to enhance their rages with something more primal. The primalist mixes his bloodline with more traditional rage powers.</p><p><b>Primal Choices:</b> At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter,a primalist can choose to take either his bloodline power or two barbarian rage powers. If the primalist chooses rage powers, those rage powers can be used in conjunction with his bloodrage, and his bloodrager level acts as his barbarian level when determining the effect of those rage powers and any prerequisites. Any other prerequisites for a rage power must be met before a primalist can choose it. This ability does not count as the rage power class feature for the purposes of feat prerequisites and other requirements. This ability alters the bloodline class feature.</p><h1>RAGESHAPER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>All bloodragers blend the unpredictable surge of arcane power with the savage fury of battle lust. For most, their rage is a conduit for the eldritch power locked in their heritage, but for a rageshaper, the latent magical energies in his blood bring about physical transformations and facilitate the blending of arcana and aggression into a deadly synthesis that few other barbarians (or even other bloodragers) can match.</p><p><b>Bestial Aspect (Su):</b> At 4th level, whenever a rageshaper gains a natural attack through the use of a polymorph spell, he can increase the damage done by that attack by one die. If the spell grants multiple natural attacks, the rageshaper must choose one kind of natural attack for the ability to enhance. At 9th level, if the rageshaper's altered form grants him a new mode of movement, that movement's base speed increases by 10 feet. This is an enhancement bonus. If the rageshaper's bloodline powers already grant natural attacks or alternate modes of movement, then the bonuses granted by bestial aspect also apply to these bloodline powers. This ability replaces blood sanctuary.</p><h1>SPELLEATER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Where other bloodragers learn to avoid or shrug off minor damage of all sorts, spelleaters tap into the power of their bloodline in order to heal damage as it comes, and can even cannibalize their own magical energy to heal more damage and continue taking the fight to the enemy.</p><p><b>Blood of Life (Su)</b>: A spelleater's blood empowers him to slowly recover from his wounds. At 2nd level, while bloodraging, a spelleater gains fast healing 1 (<i>Bestiary</i>300). At 7th level and every 3 levels thereafter, this increases by 1 (to a maximum of fast healing 6 at 19th level). Additionally, if the spelleater gains an increase to damage reduction from a bloodline, feat, or other ability, he is considered to have an effective damage reduction of 0, and the increase is added to this effective damage reduction. This ability replaces uncanny dodge and damage reduction.</p><p><b>Spell Eating (Su)</b>: At 5th level, a spelleater can consume spell slots for an extra dose of healing. As a swift action, the spelleater can expend one unused bloodrager spell slot to heal 1d8 points of damage for each level of the spell slot expended. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p><h1>STEELBLOOD (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Most bloodragers prefer light armor, but some learn the secret of using heavy armor. These steelbloods plod around the battlefield inspiring fear and delivering carnage from within a steel shell.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: A steelblood gains proficiency with heavy armor. A steelblood can cast bloodrager spells while wearing heavy armor without incurring an arcane spell failure chance. This ability alters the bloodrager's armor proficiency.</p><p><b>Indomitable Stance (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a steelblood gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks, to CMD against overrun combat maneuvers, and on Reflex saving throws against trample attacks. He also gains a +1 bonus to his AC against charge attacks and on attack rolls and damage rolls against charging creatures. This ability replaces fast movement.</p><p><b>Armored Swiftness (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, a steelblood moves faster in medium and heavy armor. When wearing medium armor or heavy armor, a steelblood can move 5 feet faster than normal for that armor, to a maximum of his unencumbered speed. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p><p><b>Armor Training (Ex)</b>: At 5th level, a steelblood learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces its armor check penalty by 1 (to a maximum penalty of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every 4 levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), these benefits improve by 1, to a maximum 4-point reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus. This ability stacks with the fighter class feature of the same name. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p><p><b>Blood Deflection (Su)</b>: At 7th level, as an immediate action, a steelblood can sacrifice a bloodrager spell slot to gain a Deflection bonus to AC equal to the level of the spell slot used. The Deflection bonus lasts until the start of his next turn. This ability can be applied after an attack roll is made against the steelblood, allowing the steelblood to convert a hit into a miss if the Deflection bonus is high enough. This ability replaces damage reduction.</p><h1>UNTOUCHABLE RAGER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>While most bloodragers are known for their inexplicable ability to focus their bloodline into a horrifying mix of martial terror and spellcasting fury, from time to time a bloodrager's bloodline acts differently. Instead of empowering the bloodrager, it shields the bloodrager from magic of all types, often keeping the bloodrager untouched within the midst of magical effects.</p><p><b>Raging Resistance (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, instead of gaining spells, a bloodrager becomes resistant to spells. While bloodraging, he gains spell resistance equal to 8 + his bloodrager level. Unlike normal spell resistance, the untouchable rager's spell resistance cannot be voluntarily lowered. As long as the untouchable rager is bloodraging, the spell resistance is persistent and can be lowered only by ending the bloodrage. At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels (when other bloodragers would gain bloodline spells), an untouchable rager's spell resistance from raging resistance is increased by 1. This ability replaces the spells, blood casting, eschew materials, and bloodline spells class features.</p><p><b>Resistance Control (Ex)</b>: At 14th level, an untouchable rager gains spell resistance from raging resistance even while not bloodraging. Additionally, as long as the untouchable rager isn't bloodraging, he can lower this spell resistance.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"0Sm0CpK9yoqNBwyr"}

brawler.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: A brawler is proficient with all simple weapons plus the handaxe, the short sword, and weapons from the close weapon group. She is proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields).</p><p><b>Brawler's Cunning (Ex)</b>: If the brawler's Intelligence score is lower than 13, it counts as 13 for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats.</p><p><b>Martial Flexibility (Ex)</b>: A brawler can take a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn't possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The brawler must meet all the feat's prerequisites. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her brawler level (minimum 4 times per day).</p><p>The brawler can use this ability again before the duration expires to replace the previous combat feat with another choice.</p><p>If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as with Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat's daily limit.</p><p>At 6th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action. She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another's prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p><p>At 10th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action. She may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p><p>At 12th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of one combat feat as an immediate action or three combat feats as a swift action. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p><p>At 20th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of any number of combat feats as a swift action. Each feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability, and can be used as a prerequisite for any of the other feats.</p><p><b>Martial Training (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist or a <i>monk's robe</i>). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, such as Stunning Fist.</p><p><b>Unarmed Strike</b>: At 1st level, a brawler gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p><p>Usually, a brawler's unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p><p>A brawler's unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purposes of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p><p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on Table 1-5: Brawler. The unarmed damage values given on that table are for Medium brawlers. A Small brawler deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large brawler deals more damage; see the following table.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Small or Large Brawler Unarmed Damage</h1><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Level</b></td><td><b>(Damage Small Brawler)</b></td><td><b>(Damage Large Brawler)</b></td></tr><tr><td>1st to 3rd</td><td>1d4</td><td>1d8</td></tr><tr><td>4th to 7th</td><td>1d6</td><td>2d6</td></tr><tr><td>8th to 11th</td><td>1d8</td><td>2d8</td></tr><tr><td>12th to 15th</td><td>1d10</td><td>3d6</td></tr><tr><td>16th to 19th</td><td>2d6</td><td>3d8</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>2d8</td><td>4d8</td></tr></table></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Bonus Combat Feats</b>: At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler gains a bonus combat feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus combat feat.</p><p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place of a bonus combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can change only one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus combat feat for the level.</p><p><b>Brawler's Flurry (Ex)</b>: Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler's flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the \"monk\" special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p><p>A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler's flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler's flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can't use such weapons as part of brawler's flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler's flurry attacks.</p><p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two- Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler's flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler's flurry.</p><p><b>Maneuver Training (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, a brawler can select one combat maneuver to receive additional training. She gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks when performing that combat maneuver and a +1 bonus to her CMD when defending against that maneuver.</p><p>At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the brawler becomes further trained in another combat maneuver, gaining the above +1 bonus combat maneuver checks and to CMD. In addition, the bonuses granted by all previous maneuver training increase by 1 each. (For example, if a brawler chooses grapple at 3rd level and sunder at 7th level, her bonuses to grapple are +2 and bonuses to sunder are +1. If she then chooses bull rush upon reaching 11th level, her bonuses to grapple are +3, to sunder are +2, and to bull rush are +1.)</p><p><b>AC Bonus (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, when a brawler wears light armor or no armor, she gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and CMD. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th, 13th, and 18th levels.</p><p>These bonuses to AC apply against touch attacks. She loses these bonuses while immobilized or helpless, wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load.</p><p><b>Knockout (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, once per day a brawler can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target unconscious. She must announce this intent before making her attack roll. If the brawler hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler's level + the higher of the brawler's Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the unconscious target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the brawler may use this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three times per day.</p><p><b>Brawler's Strike (Ex)</b>: At 5th level, a brawler's unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 12th level, she chooses one alignment component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. (This alignment component cannot be the opposite of the brawler's actual alignment, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p><p><b>Close Weapon Mastery (Ex)</b>: At 5th level, a brawler's damage with close weapons increases. When wielding a close weapon, she uses the unarmed strike damage of a brawler 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (for example, a 5th-level Medium brawler wielding a punching dagger deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon's normal 1d4). If the weapon normally deals more damage than this amount, its damage is unchanged. This ability does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The brawler can decide to use the weapon's base damage instead of her adjusted unarmed strike damage-this decision must be declared before the attack roll is made.</p><p><b>Awesome Blow (Ex)</b>: At 16th level, the brawler can perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller as a standard action. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler's choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can push the opponent only in a straight line, and the opponent can't move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent's move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)</p><p><b>Improved Awesome Blow (Ex)</b>: At 20th level, the brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a standard action. She can use it on creatures of any size. If she rolls a natural 20 on the combat maneuver check, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by attempting another combat maneuver check with all the same modifiers as the previous one; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1classes\">^Classes</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">Archetypes and Class Options</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"0erMxTMz3PWAsJHg"}

Additionally, the blade adept gains proficiency with the weapon if it is a simple or martial weapon. This ability replaces the arcanist exploits gained at 1st and 9th levels.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Sentient Sword (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, the blade adept's bonded sword becomes a powerful, sentient <i>black blade</i>. The blade advances as a <i>black blade</i>(<i>Ultimate Magic</i>47) using the blade adept's class level in place of the magus's class level and points from her arcane reservoir in place of the magus's arcane pool. A blade adept with this class feature cannot have a familiar of any kind, even from another class. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 3rd level.</p><p><b>Adept Exploits</b>: A blade adept can select from the following additional exploits.</p><p><i>Eldritch Blade:</i>A blade adept with this exploit uses her caster level instead of her class level for the purpose of advancing her bonded sword's powers.</p><p><i>Magus Arcana:</i>A blade adept can select any of the following magus arcana, using her arcane reservoir in place of the magus's arcane pool: arcane accuracy, close range, critical strike, dispelling strike, and hasted assault. The blade adept treats her arcanist level as her magus level when determining the effects of magus arcana and when specific arcana are available. A blade adept can take this exploit multiple times. Each time it is taken, it applies to a different magus arcana.</p><p><i>Spellstrike (Su):</i>The blade adept can deliver touch spells with her bonded weapon. This ability works as the magus ability of the same name.</p><p><i>Student of the Blade (Ex):</i>A blade adept can choose from any of the following bonus feats: Arcane Strike, Weapon Finesse, and Weapon Focus (in the weapon she is bonded to). This exploit can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, it applies to a different feat.</p><p><i>Weapon Specialization (Ex):</i>The arcanist gains Weapon Specialization with her chosen weapon as a bonus feat. The blade adept does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat, but must have the Weapon Focus feat with her chosen weapon to select this exploit. The arcanist must be at least 5th level to select this exploit.</p><h1>BLOOD ARCANIST (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Though most arcanists possess only a rudimentary innate arcane gift, the blood arcanist has the full power of a bloodline to draw upon.</p><p><b>Bloodline</b>: A blood arcanist selects one bloodline from those available through the sorcerer bloodline class feature. The blood arcanist gains the bloodline arcana and bloodline powers of that bloodline, treating her arcanist level as her sorcerer level. The blood arcanist does not gain the class skill, bonus feats, or bonus spells from her bloodline.</p><p>If the blood arcanist takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be of the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of her classes must change. Subject to GM approval, the blood arcanist can change her previous bloodline to make them conform.</p><p>This ability replaces the arcanist exploits gained at 1st, 3rd, 9th, and 15th levels, as well as magical supremacy. A blood arcanist cannot select the bloodline development arcanist exploit.</p><h1>BROWN-FUR TRANSMUTER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Frequently called \"brown-furs,\" these transmutation-focused arcanists are known for transforming themselves into animals. What few realize is that these specialized arcanists excel at turning themselves-and others-into all kinds of creatures.</p><p><b>Powerful Change (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, the brown-fur transmuter learns to harness the power of her magic to empower her transmutations. Whenever the brown-fur transmuter casts a transmutation spell using one of her arcanist spell slots, she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action to bolster the spell. If the spell grants a bonus to an ability score, the bonus then increases by 2. If it grants a bonus to more than one ability score, only one of the ability scores gains this bonus. The brown-fur transmuter cannot expend more than 1 point from her arcane reservoir in this way. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 3rd level.</p><p><b>Share Transmutation (Su)</b>: At 9th level, the brown-fur transmuter can target others with her transmutation spells. A brown-fur transmuter can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to change any transmutation spell with a range of personal to a range of touch. Such a spell automatically fails on unwilling creatures. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 9th level.</p><p><b>Transmutation Supremacy (Su)</b>: At 20th level, the brown-fur transmuter learns to fully master the power of transmutation. Whenever she casts a transmutation spell, it is treated as it were affected by the Extend Spell feat without altering the casting time or slot used. (She cannot then alter its duration again with the Extend Spell feat.) Whenever she uses her powerful change ability, the bonus increases by 4 instead of 2. Her share transmutation ability can now target a willing creature within 30 feet. This ability replaces magical supremacy.</p><h1>ELDRITCH FONT (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>For some arcanists, the power bubbling up from within is nearly too much to contain. They become adept at shaping this magical energy without needing to bind it up in spells.</p><p><b>Font of Power</b>: An eldritch font gains one additional spell slot for each level of arcanist spell she can cast. However, the number of spells of each level that she can prepare decreases by 1. If this reduces her spells prepared for a level to 0, she still gains spell slots of that level, which can be used to fuel her arcane reservoir (using the consume spells class feature) or to cast spells using metamagic feats.</p><p><b>Eldritch Surge (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, an eldritch font can, as a swift action, pour more power into her spells and abilities. She can add 2 to the caster level and DC of a spell, or increase her effective arcanist level by 2 when using an arcanist exploit. She becomes fatigued upon using this ability. If she is already fatigued, she becomes exhausted. If she's already exhausted or something would prevent her from becoming fatigued or exhausted, she cannot use this ability. This ability does not stack with expending points from her arcane reservoir to increase the spell's caster level or DC (as the arcane reservoir class feature). Only rest can remove fatigue or exhaustion caused by an eldritch surge-spells and abilities have no effect. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 3rd level.</p><p><b>Improved Surge (Su)</b>: At 7th level, an eldritch font can use her eldritch surge ability to reroll an attack roll associated with a spell or arcanist exploit, or to reroll all of the damage dice associated with a spell or arcanist exploit. In the case of an attack roll, this ability must be used after the die is rolled but before the result is revealed. The eldritch font must take the result of the reroll, even if it's lower. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 7th level.</p><p><b>Greater Surge (Su)</b>: At 13th level, an eldritch font can use her eldritch surge ability to force a creature to reroll a saving throw against one spell or arcanist exploit and take the lower value. The eldritch font must declare the use of this ability before the result of that creature's saving throw is revealed. If the spell or arcanist exploit affects more than one target, only one target is affected by this ability. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 13th level.</p><p><b>Bottomless Well (Su)</b>: At 20th level, an eldritch font can spend 1 hour studying her spellbook to refuel herself. Doing so allows her to prepare new spells and regain a number of points in her arcane reservoir equal to 1/2 her level. She can use this ability multiple times per day; however, she still regains spell slots only once per day. This ability replaces magical supremacy.</p><h1>ELEMENTAL MASTER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Arcanists with an affinity for elemental forces sometimes focus on one and display its power in everything they do.</p><p><b>Elemental Focus (Su)</b>: At 1st level, the elemental master must select one element: air, earth, fire, or water. The arcanist can prepare one additional spell per day of each level she can cast, but it must have the elemental descriptor of her chosen element. In addition, any spell she prepares from the opposite elemental school (air opposes earth, fire opposes water) takes up two of her prepared spell slots. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 1st level.</p><p><b>Elemental Attack (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, the elemental master gains an arcanist exploit tied to her element. If she selected air, she gains the lightning lance arcanist exploit. If she selected earth, she gains the acid jet arcanist exploit. If she selected fire, she gains the flame arc arcanist exploit. If she selected water, she gains the ice missile arcanist exploit. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 3rd level.</p><p><b>Powerful Exploit (Su)</b>: At 9th level, an elemental master increases the energy damage done by her elemental attack to 1d8 points + 1d8 points per 2 arcanist levels she possesses. The type of energy damage is determined by the elemental attack. In addition, the range of her elemental attack increases to 60 feet (in the case of flame arc, a 60-foot line). This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 9th level.</p><p><b>Greater Elemental Attack (Su)</b>: At 11th level, the elemental master gains a greater arcanist exploit tied to her element. If she selected air, she gains the dancing electricity arcanist exploit. If she selected earth, she gains the lingering acid arcanist exploit. If she selected fire, she gains the burning flame arcanist exploit. If she selected water, she gains the icy tomb arcanist exploit. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 11th level.</p><p><b>Elemental Movement (Su)</b>: At 15th level, an elemental master gains an enhancement to her movement based on her chosen element type. Air grants a fly speed of 90 feet (average maneuverability), earth grants a burrow speed of 30 feet, fire grants an increase of 30 feet to base land speed, and water grants a swim speed of 60 feet. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 15th level.</p><h1>OCCULTIST (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Not all arcanists peer inward to discern the deepest secrets of magic. Some look outward, connecting with extraplanar creatures and bartering for secrets, power, and favor.</p><p><b>Planar Spells</b>An occultist adds all <i>planar ally</i>spells to her spell list (using her arcanist level as the cleric level), and treats <i>plane shift</i>as a 5th-level arcanist spell.</p><p><b>Conjurer's Focus (Sp)</b>: An occultist can spend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to cast <i>summon monster I</i>. She can cast this spell as a standard action, and the summoned creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by one spell level, allowing her to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX</i>at 17th level), at the cost of an additional point from her arcane reservoir per spell level.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>An occultist cannot have more than one <i>summon monster</i>spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing <i>summon monster effect</i>immediately ends. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 1st level.</p><p><b>Planar Contact (Sp)</b>: At 7th level, an occultist can cast <i>augury</i>once per day and <i>contact other plane</i>once per week, using her arcanist level as her caster level. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 7th level.</p><p><b>Perfect Summoner (Su)</b>: At 20th level, an occultist can use her conjurer's focus without spending points from her arcane reservoir, and the creatures summoned last until dismissed. This ability replaces magical supremacy.</p><h1>SCHOOL SAVANT (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Some arcanists specialize in a school of magic and trade flexibility for focus. School savants are able to prepare more spells per day than typical arcanists, but their selection is more limited.</p><p><b>School Focus (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a school savant chooses a school of magic. The arcanist gains the abilities granted by that school, as the arcane school class feature of the wizard, treating her arcanist level as her wizard level for these abilities. She can also further specialize by selecting one of the subschools found in the <i>Advanced Player's Guide</i>. In addition, the arcanist can prepare one additional spell per day of each level she can cast, but this spell must be chosen from the selected school.</p><p>Finally, the arcanist must select two additional schools of magic as her opposition schools. Whenever she prepares spells from one of her opposition schools, the spell takes up two of her prepared spell slots. In addition, a school savant takes a -4 penalty on any skill checks when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of her opposition schools as a prerequisite. A school savant cannot select the school understanding arcanist exploit. This ability replaces the arcanist exploits gained at 1st, 3rd, and 7th levels.</p><h1>SPELL SPECIALIST (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Where most arcanists are broad in their study of magic, a spell specialist has her power focused in a few spells. Spell specialists are able to warp and twist the magic of their signature spells in ways other casters cannot.</p><p><b>Signature Spells</b>: At 1st level and each time a spell specialist gains a new spell level, she chooses a signature spell. The spell specialist can cast this spell without preparing it, in the same way a sorcerer casts spells spontaneously. Even though the spell specialist does not need to prepare this spell, it still counts against the number of spells she can prepare, reducing the number of spells of each level she can prepare each day by 1. A spell specialist can swap out a single signature spell for another spell of the same level when gaining a class level.</p><p>The DC for signature spells increases by 1. The spell specialist gains a +2 bonus on concentration checks when casting signature spells; this bonus increases to +4 at 10th level. Additionally, a spell specialist can apply one of the following additional effects by spending 1 point from her arcane reservoir.</p><p><i>Dismiss (Su)</i>: A spell specialist can dismiss a signature spell as a swift action instead of a standard action. Alternatively, the spell specialist can dismiss a signature spell that has a duration but isn't normally dismissible.</p><p><i>Spell Bender (Su)</i>: The spell specialist can bend the line of a spell that has a line area of effect up to 90 degrees at any single point along the line's length.</p><p><i>Spellwarp (Su)</i>: A spell specialist can reduce the radius of a spread or burst effect or shorten the length of a cone. All changes must occur in 5-foot increments, to a minimum of 5 feet. Alternatively, the spell specialist can change the area of effect of a cone spell to a line with a length equal to the spell's range.</p><p>This ability replaces the arcanist exploits gained at 1st, 7th, 13th, and 19th levels.</p><h1>UNLETTERED ARCANIST (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Some arcanists store their spells as whispered secrets within familiars instead of on paper.</p><p><b>Familiar</b>: An unlettered arcanist does not keep a spellbook. Instead, she gains a familiar in which she stores her spells as a witch does, though she does not gain a witch's patron. Treat her arcanist level as her witch level for determining the abilities and benefits granted by the familiar. Anything that would allow an unlettered arcanist to add spells to her spellbook allows her to add spells to her familiar instead. This ability replaces spellbooks.</p><p><b>Witch Spells</b>: An unlettered arcanist follows a different arcane tradition. She uses the witch spell list instead of the sorcerer/wizard list. This ability alters the spells class feature.</p><h1>WHITE MAGE (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>A white mage is an arcanist touched by a divine power and gifted with the ability to heal others.</p><p><b>Spontaneous Healing (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a white mage can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to use one of her spell slots to cast a cure spell (any spell with \"cure\" in its name) from the cleric spell list as if it were on her spell list and prepared. The spell must be of a level the arcanist can cast. At 10th level, the white mage can expend 5 points from her arcane reservoir and a spell slot of at least 5th level to cast <i>breath of life</i>. This ability replaces the arcanist exploits gained at 1st and 9th levels.</p><p><b>Greater Exploit</b>: At 11th level, a white mage can select the following greater exploit.</p><p><i>Fast Healing (Su):</i>A white mage can spend 1 point from her arcane reservoir and expend a spell slot of at least 2nd level to grant her allies the fast healing ability. Allies within 30 feet gain fast healing (<i>Bestiary</i>300) equal to 1/2 the level of the spell slot expended. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the arcanist's Charisma modifier (minimum 1).</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"1W5fPqL1NrkWcQdy"}

Unless otherwise specified, he gains the effects of his bloodline powers only while in a bloodrage; once the bloodrage ends, all powers from his bloodline immediately cease, and any physical changes the bloodrager underwent revert, restoring him to normal.</p><h1>Aberrant</h1><p>There is a taint in your blood that is both alien and bizarre. When you bloodrage, this manifests in peculiar and terrifying ways.</p><p><b>Bonus Feats</b>: Combat Reflexes, Great Fortitude, Improved Disarm, Improved Grapple, Improved Initiative, Improved Unarmed Strike, Iron Will.</p><p><b>Bonus Spells</b>: <i>Enlarge person</i>(7th), <i>see invisibility</i>(10th), <i>displacement</i>(13th), <i>black tentacles</i>(16th).</p><p><b>Bloodline Powers</b>: While bloodraging, you gain the abilities and immunities of some aberrations, but show signs of your tainted heritage.</p><p><i>Staggering Strike (Su)</i>: At 1st level, when you confirm a critical hit the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be staggered for 1 round. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your bloodrager level + your Constitution modifier. These effects stack with the Staggering Critical feat; the target must save against each effect individually.</p><p><i>Abnormal Reach (Su)</i>: At 4th level, your limbs elongate; your reach increases by 5 feet.</p><p><i>Aberrant Fortitude (Su)</i>: At 8th level, you become immune to the sickened and nauseated conditions.</p><p><i>Unusual Anatomy (Su)</i>: At 12th level, your internal anatomy shifts and changes, giving you a 50% chance to negate any critical hit or sneak attack that hits you. The damage is instead rolled normally.</p><p><i>Aberrant Resistance (Su)</i>: At 16th level, you are immune to disease, exhaustion, fatigue, and poison, and to the staggered condition.</p><p><i>Aberrant Form (Su)</i>: At 20th level, your body becomes truly unnatural. You are immune to critical hits and sneak attacks. In addition, you gain blindsight with a range of 60 feet and your bloodrager damage reduction increases by 1. You have these benefits constantly, even while not bloodraging.</p><h1>Abyssal</h1><p>Generations ago, a demon spread its filth into the essence of your bloodline. While it doesn't manifest in all of your kin, in those moments when you're bloodraging, you embody its terrifying presence.</p><p><b>Bonus Feats</b>: Cleave, Great Fortitude, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Sunder, Intimidating Prowess, Power Attack, Toughness.</p><p><b>Bonus Spells</b>: <i>Ray of enfeeblement</i>(7th), <i>bull's strength</i>(10th), <i>rage</i>(13th), <i>stoneskin</i>(16th).</p><p><b>Bloodline Powers</b>: The power of the Abyss courses through your veins, causing horrific transformations during your bloodrage.</p><p><i>Claws (Su)</i>: At 1st level, you grow claws while bloodraging. These claws are treated as natural weapons, allowing you to make two claw attacks as a full attack, using your full base attack bonus. These attacks each deal an amount of damage equal to 1d6 (1d4 if you are Small) + your Strength modifier. At 4th level, these claws are considered magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance. At 8th level, the damage increases to 1d8 points (1d6 if you are Small). At 12th level, these claws become <i>flaming</i>weapons, which deal an additional 1d6 points of fire damage on a hit.</p><p><i>Demonic Bulk (Su)</i>: At 4th level, when entering a bloodrage, you can grow one size category larger than your base size (as <i>enlarge person</i>) even if you aren't humanoid.</p><p><i>Demon Resistances (Su)</i>: At 8th level, you gain resistance 5 to acid, cold, and fire. At 16th level, these resistances increase to 10.</p><p><i>Abyssal Bloodrage (Su)</i>: At 12th level, the morale bonus to Strength granted by your bloodrage increases by 2, but the penalty to AC becomes -4 instead of -2. At 16th level, this bonus increases by 4 instead. At 20th level, it increases by 6 instead.</p><p><i>Demonic Aura (Su)</i>: At 16th level, when entering a bloodrage you can exude an aura of fire. The aura is a 5-foot burst centered on you, and deals a number of points of fire damage equal to 2d6 + your Constitution modifier to creatures that end their turns within it.</p><p><i>Demonic Immunities (Su)</i>: At 20th level, you're immune to electricity and poison. You have these benefits constantly, even while not bloodraging.</p><h1>Arcane</h1><p>While others of your kin may be powerful wizards and sorcerers, the eldritch nature of the blood coursing through your veins transforms you into a spell-breaking terror.</p><p><b>Bonus Feats</b>: Combat Reflexes, Disruptive*, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Power Attack, Quick Draw, Spellbreaker*. (Your bloodrager levels count as fighter levels for the purpose of qualifying for any feats marked with an asterisk [*].) This stacks with any levels in fighter you have.</p><p><b>Bonus Spells</b>: <i>Magic missile</i>(7th), <i>invisibility</i>(10th), <i>lightning bolt</i>(13th), <i>dimension door</i>(16th).</p><p><b>Bloodline Powers</b>: When you bloodrage, arcane power transforms you into an arcane juggernaut who can cut down even the most careful caster.</p><p><i>Disruptive Bloodrage (Su)</i>: At 1st level, the DC to cast spells defensively increases by 2 for enemies within your threatened area. This increase stacks with that granted by the Disruptive feat.</p><p><i>Arcane Bloodrage (Sp)</i>: At 4th level, when entering a bloodrage you can choose one of the following spells and apply its effects to yourself: <i>blur</i>, <i>protection from arrows</i>, <i>resist energy</i>(choose one energy type), or <i>spider climb</i>. These effects last for as long as you continue bloodraging, regardless of the spell's normal duration.</p><p><i>Greater Arcane Bloodrage (Sp)</i>: At 8th level, when entering a bloodrage, you can apply the effects of either <i>displacement</i>or <i>haste</i>to yourself. This is in addition to arcane bloodrage, and otherwise works as that ability.</p><p><i>Caster's Scourge (Ex)</i>: At 12th level, you gain a number of extra attacks of opportunity equal to your Dexterity modifier (minimum 1). You can use these attacks of opportunity only against spellcasters in your threatened area who cast or attempt to cast defensively. The Spellbreaker feat, the caster's bane bloodrage power (see below), or some similar effect is still required to make attacks of opportunity against spellcasters who are casting defensively. You have this benefit constantly, even while not bloodraging.</p><p><i>True Arcane Bloodrage (Sp)</i>: At 16th level, when entering a bloodrage, you can choose one of the following spells and apply its effects to yourself: <i>beast shape IV</i>(choose a creature your size or larger only), <i>form of the dragon I</i>, or <i>transformation</i>. This is in addition to arcane bloodrage and greater arcane bloodrage, and otherwise works as those abilities.</p><p><i>Caster's Bane (Ex)</i>: At 20th level, spellcasters with a caster level lower than your bloodrager level always provoke attacks of opportunity from you within your threatened area, even when they cast defensively. You have this benefit constantly, even while not bloodraging.</p><h1>Celestial</h1><p>By way of a celestial ancestor or divine intervention, the blood of angels fills your body with a holy potency, granting you a majestic visage and angelic powers when you enter your bloodrage.</p><p><b>Bonus Feats</b>: Dodge, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Mobility, Mounted Combat, Ride-By Attack, Weapon Focus.</p><p><b>Bonus Spells</b>: <i>Bless</i>(7th), <i>resist energy</i>(10th), <i>heroism</i>(13th), <i>holy smite</i>(16th).</p><p><b>Bloodline Powers</b>: Your bloodline grants a number of resistances and changes your form to something angelic and terrible to behold when you bloodrage.</p><p><i>Angelic Attacks (Su)</i>: At 1st level, your melee attacks are considered good-aligned weapons for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. Furthermore, when you deal damage with a melee attack to an evil outsider, you deal an additional 1d6 points of damage. This additional damage stacks with effects such as <i>align weapon</i>and those granted by a weapon with the <i>holy</i>weapon special ability.</p><p><i>Celestial Resistances (Ex)</i>: At 4th level, you gain resistance 5 to acid and cold. At 12th level, these resistances increase to 10.</p><p><i>Conviction (Su)</i>: At 8th level, once per bloodrage you can reroll one ability check, skill check, or saving throw you just made. You must decide to use this ability after the die is rolled, but before the GM reveals the result. You must take the second result, even if it's worse.</p><p><i>Wings of Heaven (Su)</i>: At 12th level, you can choose to sprout feathery wings and fly with a speed of 60 feet and good maneuverability. At 20th level, your fly speed increases to 80 feet.</p><p><i>Angelic Protection (Su)</i>: At 16th level, you gain a +4 Deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. In addition, you are affected as if subject to a <i>protection from evil</i>spell. This effect cannot be dispelled.</p><p><i>Ascension (Su)</i>: At 20th level, you become infused with the power of the heavens. You gain immunity to acid, cold, and petrification. You also gain resistance 10 to electricity and fire, as well as a +4 racial bonus on saving throws against poison. You have these benefits constantly, even while not bloodraging.</p><h1>Destined</h1><p>Your bloodline is destined for great things. When you bloodrage, you exude a measure of greatness that makes all but the most legendary creatures seem lesser.</p><p><b>Bonus Feats</b>: Diehard, Endurance, Improved Initiative, Intimidating Prowess, Leadership, Lightning Reflexes, Weapon Focus.</p><p><b>Bonus Spells</b>: <i>Shield</i>(7th), <i>blur</i>(10th), <i>protection from energy</i>(13th), <i>freedom of movement</i>(16th).</p><p><b>Bloodline Powers</b>: Your future greatness grants you the might to strike your enemies in awe-inspiring ways.</p><p><i>Destined Strike (Su)</i>: At 1st level, as a free action up to three times per day, you can grant yourself an insight bonus equal to 1/2 your bloodrager level (minimum 1) on one melee attack. At 12th level, you can use this ability up to five times per day.</p><p><i>Fated Bloodrager (Su)</i>: At 4th level, you gain a +1 luck bonus to AC and on saving throws. At 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p><p><i>Certain Strike (Su)</i>: At 8th level, you may reroll an attack roll once during a bloodrage. You must decide to use this ability after the die is rolled, but before the GM reveals the result. You must take the second result, even if it's worse.</p><p><i>Defy Death (Su)</i>: At 12th level, once per day when an attack or a spell that deals damage would result in your death, you can attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save. If you succeed, you are instead reduced to 1 hit point; if you succeed and already have 0 hit points or fewer, you instead take no damage.</p><p><i>Unstoppable (Su)</i>: At 16th level, any critical threats you score are automatically confirmed. Any critical threats made against you are confirmed only if the second roll results in a natural 20 (or if the threat is automatically confirmed).</p><p><i>Victory or Death (Su)</i>: At 20th level, you gain immunity to paralysis and petrification, as well as to the stunned, dazed, and staggered conditions. You have these benefits constantly, even while not bloodraging.</p><h1>Draconic</h1><p>At some point in your family's history, a dragon interbred with your bloodline.

All of your melee attacks are considered to have the <i>bane</i>special ability corresponding to that type. This ability doesn't stack with other forms of <i>bane</i>.</p><h1>Infernal</h1><p>The Pit lives in your blood.

This effect does not cause an existing shaken or frightened condition (from this ability or another source) to turn into frightened or panicked. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p><p><i>Ghost Strike (Su)</i>: At 4th level, your melee attacks are treated as if they have the <i>ghost touch</i>weapon special ability.</p><p><i>Death's Gift (Su)</i>: At 8th level, you gain cold resistance 10, as well as DR 10/- against nonlethal damage.</p><p><i>Frightful Strikes (Su)</i>: At 12th level, as a swift action once per bloodrage you can empower your melee attacks with fear.

If the warpriest worships a deity with unarmed strike as its favored weapon, the warpriest gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat.</p><p><b>Spells</b>: A warpriest casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell list. His alignment, however, can restrict him from casting certain spells opposed to his moral or ethical beliefs; see the Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells section on page 62. A warpriest must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p><p>A warpriest's highest level of spells is 6th. Cleric spells of 7th level or higher are not on the warpriest class spell list, and a warpriest cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of cleric spells of 7th level or higher.</p><p>To prepare or cast a spell, a warpriest must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell's level. The saving throw DC against a warpriest's spell is equal to 10 + the spell's level + the warpriest's Wisdom modifier.</p><p>Like other spellcasters, a warpriest can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-14. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 on page 17 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>).</p><p>Warpriests meditate or pray for their spells. Each warpriest must choose a time when he spends 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain his daily allotment of spells. A warpriest can prepare and cast any spell on the cleric spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p><p><b>Aura (Ex)</b>: A warpriest of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura (as a cleric) corresponding to the deity's alignment (see <i>detect evil</i>on page 266 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>).</p><p><b>Blessings (Su)</b>: A warpriest's deity influences his alignment, the magic he can perform, his values, and how others see him. Each warpriest can select two blessings from among those granted by his deity (each deity grants the blessings tied to its domains). A warpriest can select an alignment blessing (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if his alignment matches that blessing. If a warpriest isn't devoted to a particular deity, he selects two blessings to represent his spiritual inclinations and abilities, subject to GM discretion. The restriction on alignment blessings still applies.</p><p>Each blessing grants a minor power at 1st level and a major power at 10th level. A warpriest can call upon his blessings a number of times per day (in any combination) equal to 3 + 1/2 his warpriest level (to a maximum of 13 times per day at 20th level). Each time he calls upon any one of his blessings, it counts against his daily limit. The save DC of these blessings is equal to 10 + 1/2 the warpriest's level + the warpriest's Wisdom modifier.</p><p>If a warpriest also has levels in a class that grants cleric domains, the blessings he chooses must match the domains selected by that class. Subject to GM discretion, the warpriest can change his previously selected blessings or domains to make all of them conform. Warpriest blessings are described at the end of this class entry.</p><p><b>Focus Weapon</b>: At 1st level, a warpriest receives Weapon Focus as a bonus feat (he can choose any weapon, rather than only his deity's favored weapon).</p><p><b>Orisons</b>: Warpriests can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1-14. These spells are cast as any other spell, but aren't expended when cast and can be used again.</p><p><b>Sacred Weapon (Su)</b>: At 1st level, weapons wielded by a warpriest are charged with the power of his faith. In addition to the favored weapon of his deity, the warpriest can designate a weapon as a sacred weapon by selecting that weapon with the Weapon Focus feat; if he has multiple Weapon Focus feats, this ability applies to all of them. Whenever the warpriest hits with his sacred weapon, the weapon damage is based on his level and not the weapon type. The damage for Medium warpriests is given on Table 1-14; see the table below for Small and Large warpriests. The warpriest can decide to use the weapon's base damage instead of the sacred weapon damage-this decision must be declared before the attack roll is made. (if the weapon's base damage exceeds the sacred weapon damage, its damage is unchanged.) This increase in damage does not affect any other aspect of the weapon, and doesn't apply to alchemical items, bombs, or other weapons that deal only energy damage.</p><p>At 4th level, the warpriest gains the ability to enhance one of his sacred weapons with divine power as a swift action. This ability grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every 4 levels beyond 4th, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). If the warpriest has more than one sacred weapon, he can enhance another on the following round by using another swift action. The warpriest can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his warpriest level, but these rounds don't need to be consecutive.</p><p>These bonuses stack with any existing bonuses the weapon might have, to a maximum of +5. The warpriest can enhance a weapon to have any of the following special abilities: <i>brilliant energy</i>, <i>defending</i>, <i>disruption</i>, <i>flaming</i>, <i>frost</i>, <i>keen</i>, or <i>shock</i>. In addition, if the warpriest is chaotic, he can also add <i>anarchic</i>or <i>vicious</i>. If he is evil, he can also add <i>mighty cleaving</i>or <i>unholy</i>. If he is good, he can also add <i>ghost touch</i>or <i>holy</i>. If he is lawful, he can also add <i>axiomatic</i>or <i>merciful</i>. If he is neutral (with no other alignment components), he can also add <i>spell storing</i>or <i>thundering</i>. Adding any of these special abilities consumes an amount of enhancement bonus equal to the special ability's base price modifier (see Table 15-9 on page 469 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>). Duplicate special abilities don't stack. The weapon must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus before any special abilities can be added.</p><p>If multiple weapons are enhanced, each one consumes rounds of use individually. The enhancement bonus and special abilities are determined the first time the ability is used each day, and cannot be changed until the next day. These benefits do not apply if another creature is wielding the weapon, but they continue to be in effect if the weapon otherwise leaves the warpriest's possession (such as if the weapon is thrown). This ability can be ended as a free action at the start of the warpriest's turn (that round does not count against the total duration, unless the ability is resumed during the same round). If the warpriest uses this ability on a double weapon, the effects apply to only one end of the weapon.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Small or Large Warpriest Sacred Weapon Damage</h1><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Level</b></td><td><b>Damage (Small)</b></td><td><b>Damage (Large)</b></td></tr><tr><td>1st-4th</td><td>1d4</td><td>1d8</td></tr><tr><td>5th-9th</td><td>1d6</td><td>2d6</td></tr><tr><td>10th-14th</td><td>1d8</td><td>2d8</td></tr><tr><td>15th-19th</td><td>1d10</td><td>3d6</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>2d6</td><td>3d8</td></tr></table></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Spontaneous Casting</b>: A good warpriest (or a neutral warpriest of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that he did not prepare ahead of time. The warpriest can expend any prepared spell that isn't an orison to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower. A cure spell is any spell with \"cure\" in its name.</p><p>An evil warpriest (or a neutral warpriest of an evil deity) can't convert prepared spells to cure spells, but can convert them to inflict spells. An inflict spell is any spell with \"inflict\" in its name.</p><p>A warpriest who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil chooses whether he can convert spells into either cure spells or inflict spells. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. This choice also determines whether the warpriest channels positive or negative energy (see Channel Energy, below).</p><p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells</b>: A warpriest cannot cast spells of an alignment opposed to his own or his deity's (if he has a deity). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaotic, evil, good, and lawful descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p><p><b>Bonus Languages</b>: A warpriest's bonus language options include Abyssal, Celestial, and Infernal. These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of his race.</p><p><b>Fervor (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, a warpriest can draw upon the power of his faith to heal wounds or harm foes. He can also use this ability to quickly cast spells that aid in his struggles. This ability can be used a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his warpriest level + his Wisdom modifier.</p><p>By expending one use of fervor, a good warpriest (or one who worships a good deity) can touch a creature to heal it of 1d6 points of damage + an additional 1d6 points for every 3 warpriest levels he possesses beyond 2nd (to a maximum of 7d6 at 20th level). Using this ability is a standard action (unless the warpriest targets himself, in which case it's a swift action). Alternatively, the warpriest can use this ability to harm an undead creature, dealing the same amount of damage he would otherwise heal with a melee touch attack. Using fervor in this way is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Undead do not receive a saving throw against this damage. This use of fervor counts as positive energy.</p><p>An evil warpriest (or one who worships an evil deity) can use this ability to instead deal damage to living creatures with a melee touch attack and heal undead creatures with a touch. This use of fervor counts as negative energy.</p><p>A neutral warpriest who worships a neutral deity (or one who is not devoted to a particular deity) uses this ability as a good warpriest if he chose to spontaneously cast cure spells, or as an evil warpriest if he chose to spontaneously cast inflict spells.</p><p>As a swift action, a warpriest can expend one use of fervor to cast any one warpriest spell he has prepared with a casting time of 1 round or shorter. When cast in this way, the spell can target only the warpriest, even if it could normally affect other or multiple targets. Spells cast in this way don't require somatic components and do not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p><p><b>Bonus Feats</b>: At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a warpriest gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those categorized as combat feats. The warpriest must meet the prerequisites for these feats, but he treats his warpriest level as his base attack bonus (in addition to base attack bonuses gained from other classes and racial Hit Dice) for the purpose of qualifying for these feats. Finally, for the purposes of these feats, the warpriest can select feats that have a minimum number of fighter levels as a prerequisite, treating his warpriest level as his fighter level.</p><p><b>Channel Energy (Su)</b>: At 4th level, a warpriest can release a wave of energy by channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol. This energy can be used for healing or to deal damage, depending on the type of energy channeled and the creatures targeted. Using this ability is a standard action that expends two uses of the warpriest's fervor and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The warpriest must present a holy (or unholy) symbol to use this ability.</p><p>A good warpriest (or one who worships a good deity) channels positive energy and can choose either to heal living creatures or to deal damage to undead creatures. An evil warpriest (or one who worships an evil deity) channels negative energy and can choose to either deal damage to living creatures or heal undead creatures. A neutral warpriest who worships a neutral deity (or one who is not devoted to a particular deity) channels positive energy if he chose to spontaneously cast cure spells or negative energy if he chose to spontaneously cast inflict spells.</p><p>Channeling energy affects all creatures of the chosen type (either undead or living) in a 30-foot-radius burst centered on the warpriest. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to the amount listed in the fervor ability. A creature that takes damage from channeled energy can attempt a Will saving throw to halve the damage. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the warpriest's level + the warpriest's Wisdom modifier. A creature healed by channeled energy cannot exceed its maximum hit point total-all excess healing is lost. A warpriest can choose whether or not to include himself in this effect.</p><p><b>Sacred Armor (Su)</b>: At 7th level, the warpriest gains the ability to enhance his armor (but not shields) with divine power as a swift action. This ability grants the armor a +1 enhancement bonus. For every 3 levels beyond 7th, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 19th level). The warpriest can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to his warpriest level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p><p>These bonuses stack with any existing bonuses the armor might have, to a maximum of +5. The warpriest can enhance armor with any of the following special abilities: <i>energy resistance</i>(normal, improved, and greater), <i>fortification</i>(heavy, light, or moderate), <i>glamered,</i>or <i>spell resistance</i>(13, 15, 17, or 19). Adding any of these special abilities consumes an amount of enhancement bonus equal to the special ability's base price modifier (see Table 15-4 on page 463 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>). For this purpose, <i>glamered</i>counts as a +1 bonus, <i>energy resistance</i>counts as +2, <i>improved energy resistance</i>counts as +4, and <i>greater energy resistance</i>counts as +5. Duplicate special abilities do not stack. The armor must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus before any special abilities can be added.</p><p>The enhancement bonus and armor special abilities are determined the first time the ability is used each day and cannot be changed until the next day. These benefits apply only while the warpriest is wearing the armor, and end immediately if the armor is removed or leaves the warpriest's possession. This ability can be ended as a free action at the start of the warpriest's turn.</p><p>When the warpriest uses this ability, he can also use his sacred weapon ability as a free action by expending one use of fervor.</p><p><b>Aspect of War (Su)</b>: At 20th level, the warpriest can embody an aspect of war, growing in power and martial ability. Once per day as a swift action, a warpriest can treat his level as his base attack bonus, gains DR 10/-, and can move at his full speed regardless of the armor he is wearing or his encumbrance. In addition, the blessings he calls upon during this time don't count against his daily limit. This ability lasts for 1 minute.</p><h1>EX-WARPRIESTS</h1><p>A warpriest who grossly violates the code of conduct required by his god loses all spells and class features, except for his armor, shield, weapon proficiencies, and bonus feats. He cannot thereafter gain levels as a warpriest of that god until he atones for his deeds (see the <i>atonement</i>spell on page 245 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>).</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1classes\">^Classes</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">Archetypes and Class Options</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"5N3BMyGbO2m7bJuY"}

Note that the prerequisites and benefits of the feats listed in this table are abbreviated for ease of reference. See the feats' descriptions for full details.</p><p>The following format is used for all feat descriptions.</p><p><b>Feat Name</b>: The line that bears the feat's name also indicates what subcategory, if any, the feat belongs to, and is followed by a basic description of what the feat does.</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b>: This line lists a minimum ability score, another feat or feats, a minimum base attack bonus, a minimum number of ranks in one or more skills, or anything else required to take the feat. This entry is absent if a feat has no prerequisites. A feat can have more than one prerequisite. Prerequisites from this book such as classes, class features, and feats are marked with a superscript dagger (\"*\").</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: This benefit is what a feat enables the character (\"you\" in the feat description) to do. If a character has the same feat more than once, its benefits do not stack unless indicated in the description.</p><p><b>Normal</b>: This line clarifies what a character who does not have this feat is limited to or restricted from doing. If not having the feat causes no particular drawback, this entry is absent.</p><p><b>Special</b>: Additional unusual facts about the feat.</p><h1>Aberrant Tumor</h1><p>To the surprise of others, that strange growth on you is actually your spellcasting companion.</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Aberrant bloodline.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain a tumor familiar, as the tumor familiar alchemist discovery (<i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic</i>17), with an effective alchemist level equal to the level of the class that grants your aberrant bloodline for determining the tumor familiar's abilities. If multiple classes grant you the aberrant bloodline, those class levels stack for determining your effective alchemist level.</p><h1>Amateur Investigator</h1><p>Your knowledge is more than plain smarts-it's inspired.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Int 13, 1 rank in at least one Knowledge skill, no levels in a class that has the inspiration* class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: Like an investigator, you have the ability to augment your Knowledge, Linguistics, and Spellcraft checks. You gain a pool of inspiration equal to your Intelligence modifier. You can expend one use of inspiration as a free action to add 1d6 to the result of a Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft check, as long as you are trained in that skill (even if you take 10 or take 20 on that check). You make this choice after the check is rolled and before the result of the roll is revealed. You can use inspiration only once per skill check. Your pool of inspiration refreshes each day, typically after you get a restful night's sleep.</p><p><b>Special</b>: If you later gain levels in a class that has the inspiration class feature, you can immediately trade this feat for the Extra Inspiration feat.</p><h1>Amateur Swashbuckler (Combat)</h1><p>Although you're not a swashbuckler, you have and can use panache.</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b>: No levels in a class that has the panache* class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain a small amount of panache and the ability to perform a single 1st-level swashbuckler deed. Choose a 1st-level deed from the swashbuckler's deeds class feature (see page 56; you can't select opportune parry and riposte). Once chosen, this deed can't be changed.</p><p>At the start of each day, you gain 1 panache point. Throughout the day, you can gain a number of panache points, up to a maximum equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). You can regain panache points as the swashbuckler's panache class feature (see page 56). You can spend these points to perform the 1st-level deed you chose upon taking this feat as well as any other deeds you have gained through feats or magic items.</p><p><b>Special</b>: If you later gain levels in a class that has the panache class feature, you can immediately trade this feat for the Extra Panache feat.</p><h1>Animal Soul</h1><p>Your close bond with an animal allows you to ignore harmful magic that cannot affect your wild side.</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Animal companion or mount class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: You can choose not to allow spells and effects to effect you if they would not be capable of affecting both your original creature type and the animal creature type.</p><h1>Anticipate Dodge (Combat)</h1><p>Your knowledge of mobility and your attack prowess allow you to thwart elusive opponents.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Dodge, Mobility; base attack bonus +7, brawler* level 4th, or monk level 4th.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: You automatically know whether a creature you can see has a dodge bonus to its AC. You gain up to a +2 bonus on attack rolls against a target that has a dodge bonus. This bonus cannot exceed the dodge bonus of the creature you attack.</p><h1>Barroom Brawler (Combat)</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>You have learned how to mimic the combat tricks and forms of others.</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Base attack bonus +4.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: Once per day as a move action, you can gain the benefit of a combat feat that you do not possess for 1 minute. You must otherwise meet all of the feat's requirements.</p><p><b>Special</b>: If you have the martial flexibility class feature, this feat instead grants you one additional use per day of that ability.</p><h1>Battle Cry (Combat)</h1><p>Your shout heartens your allies and encourages them in the fight.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Cha 13; base attack bonus +5 or Perform (act, oratory, or sing) 5 ranks.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Benefit</b>: A number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus, you can let out a battle cry as a swift action. When you do, allies within 30 feet who can hear you gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear. This effect lasts for 1 minute.</p><p>If an ally is under the effect of this feat and fails a saving throw against a fear effect, she can choose to end the battle cry's effect on her to reroll the failed save. The ally must take the result of the reroll, even if it's lower. Each ally can use this effect only once per use of this feat.</p><h1>Befuddling Strike (Combat)</h1><p>You know just where to strike to temporarily send your enemy into a confused stupor.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: Befuddling Strike forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll-thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt. An opponent who fails this saving throw is confused for 1d4 rounds. You can attempt to use Befuddling Strike once per day for every 4 character levels you have, but you can use it no more than once per round. Constructs, incorporeal creatures, mindless creatures, plants, undead, and creatures that are immune to critical hits cannot be affected by this ability.</p><h1>Believer's Boon</h1><p>Your deity rewards you for your faithfulness and your steadfast worship.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Wis 13, alignment must be within one step of your deity's.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: When you take this feat, choose one domain granted by your deity. You can use the 1st-level domain ability that clerics of that domain can use a number of times or rounds per day, but you can use it only once per day or 1 round per day, whichever is appropriate. Your effective cleric level in regard to this ability is 1st level. If the domain has a 1st-level ability that does not meet this specification, you cannot use it.</p><p><b>Special</b>: You can take this feat twice. When you take it a second time, you choose another domain granted by your deity.</p><p>If you grossly violate the code of conduct required by your deity, your alignment shifts so that it is more than one step away from your deity's, or you no longer worship your deity, you lose access to this feat. You can regain it once you atone for your misdeeds to your deity (see the <i>atonement</i>spell on page 245 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>).</p><h1>Believer's Hands</h1><p>Thanks to your faith, you can heal others with a mere touch of your hand.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Wis 13, Believer's Boon*, must be lawful good, alignment must be within one step of your deity's.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: Once per day, you can use the paladin's lay on hands ability. Your effective paladin level is equal to 1/2 your character level (minimum 1). If you already have (or later gain) the lay on hands ability, you instead gain one extra use of lay on hands each day.</p><p><b>Special</b>: This feat counts as having the lay on hands ability for the purpose of qualifying for feats such as Extra Lay on Hands.</p><p>If you grossly violate the code of conduct required by your deity, your alignment shifts so that it is more than one step away from your deity's, or you no longer worship your deity, you lose access to this feat. You can regain it once you atone for your misdeeds to your deity (see the <i>atonement</i>spell on page 245 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>).</p><h1>Blasting Charge</h1><p>You funnel the power of your bloodrage into a strike capable of erupting with arcane power.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Base attack bonus +7, ability to cast 2nd-level bloodrager* spells, bloodrage* class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: While you are bloodraging, at the end of a charge you can expend a bloodrager spell slot as a swift action to imbue your charge attack with extra power. You deal an additional 1d6 points of damage per level of the spell slot expended. This extra damage is force damage, and it's not multiplied in the case of a critical hit.</p><p>If your bloodline has a specific energy type associated with it (as the elemental or draconic bloodlines do), you can increase the damage to 1d8 points per level of the spell slot expended, and this extra damage is of that type.</p><h1>Blessed Striker</h1><p>You attacks are augmented by the strength of your and your deity's shared alignment.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Base attack bonus +11, ability to cast divine spells, alignment must be within one step of your deity's.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: All of your attacks are treated as having whatever alignment components you and your deity share for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><b>Special</b>: If you grossly violate the code of conduct required by your deity, your alignment shifts so that it is more than one step away from your deity's, or you no longer worship your deity, you lose access to this feat. You can regain it once you atone for your misdeeds to your deity (see the <i>atonement</i>spell on page 245 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>).</p><h1>Blooded Arcane Strike (Combat)</h1><p>Arcane energy guides your devastating attack.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Arcane Strike, ability to cast arcane spells, bloodrage* class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: While you are bloodraging, you don't need to spend a swift action to use your Arcane Strike-it is always in effect. When you use this ability with Vital Strike, Improved Vital Strike, or Greater Vital Strike, the bonus on damage rolls for Arcane Strike is multiplied by the number of times (two, three, or four) you roll damage dice for one of those feats.</p><h1>Bookish Rogue</h1><p>Thanks to your preparation, your arcane ability is more varied than most.</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Minor magic rogue talent.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: By studying a spellbook for 10 minutes, you can change one spell you are able to cast using your minor magic or major magic rogue talent to one sorcerer/wizard spell of the same level contained in the spellbook. This change is permanent until you take the time to change it via this feat again.</p><h1>Canny Tumble (Combat)</h1><p>Your acrobatic prowess distracts your foes.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Dodge, Mobility, Acrobatics 5 ranks.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: When you use Acrobatics to move through an opponent's threatened area or space without provoking an attack of opportunity from that opponent, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your next melee attack roll against that opponent and that opponent is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, as long as you make that attack before the start of your next turn.</p><h1>Channeled Blessing</h1><p>Your channeled energy can deliver a warpriest's blessing.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Blessings* class feature, channel energy class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: When you channel energy to heal, you can instead deliver a warpriest's blessing to a single willing creature (including yourself ) in the area that otherwise would have been healed by your channeled energy. The blessing must be one that requires a standard action and affects one or more creatures. If the blessing would normally affect multiple targets, you affect only a single target. The target receives the blessing in place of the healing and any other effects of the channeled energy. (This application doesn't count toward your uses of blessings per day.)</p><h1>Channeling Force (Combat)</h1><p>You distill your channeled energy into a sheen of force that surrounds your weapon for a limited time.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Ability to cast at least one force spell, channel energy class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: As a swift action, you can expend one use of channel energy to grant your weapon attacks a bonus on damage rolls equal to the number of dice of your channel energy. This extra damage is force damage. This benefit lasts for your next three weapon attacks or until the end of the combat encounter, whichever comes first.</p><h1>Confounding Tumble Deed (Panache)</h1><p>You can befuddle a foe by striking a blow after tumbling.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Amateur Swashbuckler* feat or panache* class feature, Canny Tumble*, Acrobatics 7 ranks.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: When you use Acrobatics to move through an opponent's threatened area or space without provoking an attack of opportunity from that opponent and then hit that foe with a melee attack in the same round, as a free action you can spend 1 panache point to deny that foe its Dexterity bonus to its Armor Class until the end of your next turn.</p><h1>Coordinated Shot (Combat, Teamwork)</h1><p>Your ranged attacks against an opponent take advantage of your ally's positioning.</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Point-Blank Shot.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: If your ally with this feat is threatening an opponent and is not providing cover to that opponent against your ranged attacks, you gain a +1 bonus on ranged attacks against that opponent. If your ally with this feat is flanking that opponent with another ally (even if that other ally doesn't have this feat), this bonus increases to +2.</p><h1>Counter Reflexes (Combat)</h1><p>Your opponent's advanced training in moving around you is surpassed only by your readiness for it.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Anticipate Dodge*, Dodge, Mobility; base attack bonus +9, brawler* level 6th, or monk level 6th.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: Opponents with the Mobility feat do not gain the dodge bonus granted by that feat when they provoke attacks of opportunity by moving out of or within your threatened area.</p><h1>Counterpunch (Combat)</h1><p>With deft Reflexes, you capitalize on opponents' mistakes.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Dex 18, Combat Reflexes, Improved Unarmed Strike, Weapon Focus (unarmed strike); base attack bonus +16 or brawler* level 12th.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: Once per round, when you are fighting unarmed with both hands free and an opponent misses you with a melee attack, the opponent provokes an attack of opportunity from you. You must use an unarmed strike for this attack of opportunity.</p><h1>Dazing Fist (Combat)</h1><p>You know just where to strike to daze your foe.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +4.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). Dazing Fist forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. A foe who fails this saving throw is dazed for 1 round, until just before your next turn. You can attempt to use Dazing Fist once per day for every 4 character levels you have, but no more than once per round.

If you have levels in multiple classes that have the same ability (or abilities that are counted as others for the purposes of meeting feat prerequisites, like the skald's raging song counting as bardic performance), this single pool applies to all those abilities together, and doesn't grant extra uses to each one separately. You may spend this pool of uses each day on any of these abilities in whatever manner you choose.</p><p>For example, if you have levels in both barbarian and bloodrager and you take the Extra Rage feat, you gain 6 extra rounds that you can either use to rage or bloodrage or split between the two. The feat does not give both an extra 6 rounds of rage and 6 rounds of bloodrage-it gives you exactly 6 rounds each day that you can use for either one of these abilities. One day, you might use 4 of these rounds for rage and 2 on bloodrage; the next day, you might use 3 on each.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">^ Feats</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter4spells\">Spells</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"6QabeyxtVrHibWqh"}

A piercing or slashing weapon that deals hit point damage to you is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds at a Reflex save. A creature can pry off a stuck weapon on its turn as a standard action with a successful Strength check against the spell's DC. Strong alcohol or <i>universal solvent</i>dissolves the adhesive. The glue breaks down 5 rounds after you die, or when the duration ends. This glue has no effect while underwater or in environments that lack air.</p><h1>ADHESIVE SPITTLE</h1><p><b>School</b>conjuration (creation); <b>Level</b>alchemist 1, sorcerer/ wizard 1, witch 1</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S</p><p><b>Range</b>15 ft.</p><p><b>Target</b>one creature</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 round/level or until discharged (see text)</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>Reflex partial; <b>Spell Resistance</b>no</p><p>Once during this spell's duration, you can spit a viscous liquid as a standard action. This liquid functions as a tanglefoot bag, except you do not have to make a successful attack roll to hit your target. The DCs to counteract this adhesive (to avoid being stuck to the floor, to fly, to break the adhesive, or to cast a spell) use the spell's DC rather than a tanglefoot bag's normal DCs. The adhesive persists for 2d4 rounds after you spit it.</p><h1>ADJUSTABLE DISGUISE</h1><p><b>School</b>illusion (glamer); <b>Level</b>alchemist 3, antipaladin 3, bard 3, inquisitor 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S</p><p><b>Range</b>personal</p><p><b>Target</b>you</p><p><b>Duration</b>10 minutes/level (D)</p><p>This spell functions as <i>disguise self</i>, except as a swift action you can alter the disguise (within the limitations of <i>disguise self</i>). For example, you could make yourself look like a young human city guard, then an old elven wizard of the opposite gender, then a halfling thief, and so on. You can change the disguise a number of times equal to your caster level.</p><h1>ADJUSTABLE POLYMORPH</h1><p><b>School</b>transmutation (polymorph); <b>Level</b>alchemist 4, bard 4, magus 4, shaman 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, summoner 4, witch 4</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S, M (a small piece of doppelganger flesh)</p><p><b>Range</b>personal</p><p><b>Target</b>you</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 minute/level (D)</p><p>This spell functions as <i>alter self</i>, except you can as a swift action alter the disguise (within the limitations of <i>alter self</i>). For example, you could transform yourself into a halfling, then a lizardfolk, then an elf, and so on. You can change your form a number of times equal to your caster level.</p><h1>AGGRESSIVE THUNDERCLOUD</h1><p><b>School</b>evocation [electricity]; <b>Level</b>druid 2, magus 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S, M/DF (a piece of a tree struck by lightning)</p><p><b>Range</b>medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p><p><b>Effect</b>5-ft.-diameter sphere</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 round/level</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>Reflex negates; <b>Spell Resistance</b>yes</p><p>A crackling, spherical storm cloud flies in whichever direction you point and deals electricity damage to those it strikes. It has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability. If it enters a space that contains a creature, the storm stops moving for the round and deals 3d6 points of electricity damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates that damage. It provides concealment (20% miss chance) to anything within it, and its flickering light illuminates the same area a candle would.</p><p>The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (as a move action for you); otherwise, it stays at rest and crackles with lightning. It can be moved by wind effects and counts as a Small creature for the purpose of determining how winds affect it. The sphere has no physical substance and cannot exert any force on corporeal creatures or objects. It disperses if it exceeds the spell's range.</p><h1>AGGRESSIVE THUNDERCLOUD, GREATER</h1><p><b>School</b>evocation [electricity, sonic]; <b>Level</b>druid 4, magus 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 4</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>Reflex negates and Fortitude negates (see text); <b>Spell Resistance</b>yes</p><p>This spell functions as <i>aggressive thundercloud</i>, except it deals 6d6 points of electricity damage to any creature it strikes. The first creature damaged by the cloud is also stunned for 1 round (Fortitude negates); this is a sonic effect.</p><h1>AIR GEYSER</h1><p><b>School</b>evocation [air], <b>Level</b>bloodrager 3, druid 3, magus 3, shaman 4, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S</p><p><b>Range</b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><b>Target</b>one creature or object up to Large size</p><p><b>Duration</b>instantaneous</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>Reflex partial (see text); <b>Spell Resistance</b>yes</p><p>You create a powerful blast of air capable of flinging an opponent upward. If the target fails its Reflex save, the force of the air deals 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage and hurls the target upward a number of feet equal to 5 your caster level. If a solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered, the target strikes the object in the same manner as it would during a normal fall. After this blast of air ceases, the target falls down (unless it was flying), taking falling damage as normal. A successful save means the target takes half damage from the air blast but is not moved by it.</p><h1>AIR STEP</h1><p><b>School</b>transmutation [air]; <b>Level</b>alchemist 2, bard 2, cleric 2, druid 2, ranger 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S, M (a goose feather)</p><p><b>Range</b>personal</p><p><b>Target</b>you</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 minute/level</p><p>This spell functions as <i>air walk</i>, except you can rise no higher than 1 foot off the ground, you cannot pass over liquid, and the air you walk on is less stable than solid ground. When walking on air, you ignore difficult terrain that is less than 1 foot high, you do not trigger effects based on weight (such as a pressure plate), and any creature trying to track you through areas you crossed with this spell takes a -10 penalty on its Perception or Survival check to do so. Because of the instability of the air you walk on, your speed is reduced by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet) and you take a -4 penalty on Acrobatics, Climb, and Ride checks.</p><p>If you have 1 rank in Fly, your speed is not reduced when you use this spell, and you can cross over liquid at half speed. If you have 5 ranks in Fly, you can cross liquid at full speed and do not take the penalties to your skill checks.</p><h1>ALIGN WEAPON, COMMUNAL</h1><p><b>School</b>transmutation [see text]; <b>Level</b>cleric 3, inquisitor 3</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S, DF</p><p><b>Range</b>touch</p><p><b>Target</b>weapons or projectiles touched</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 minute/level</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>Will negates (harmless, object); <b>Spell Resistance</b>yes (harmless, object)</p><p>This spell functions as <i>align weapon</i>, except you divide the duration in 1-minute increments between any number of touched weapons. Every group of up to 50 projectiles (which must be together at the time of casting) counts as one weapon for the purpose of dividing the spell's duration.</p><h1>ALTER MUSICAL INSTRUMENT</h1><p><b>School</b>illusion (figment); <b>Level</b>bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S, F (an instrument)</p><p><b>Range</b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><b>Target</b>one musical instrument</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 hour/level (D)</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>Fortitude negates (object); <b>Spell Resistance</b>yes (object)</p><p>You alter an instrument so it sounds like a different kind of instrument you are familiar with. The change could be minor (such as making a lute sound like a guitar) or major (making a keyboard sound like drums). All other aspects of the instrument-such as volume, pitch, and how it is played- are unchanged. For example, a piccolo made to sound like an organ is no louder than a normal piccolo, can produce only high notes in the piccolo range, and is a wind instrument.</p><h1>ANCHORED STEP</h1><p><b>School</b>transmutation; <b>Level</b>alchemist 3, druid 3, shaman 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S, M (a bit of oak root)</p><p><b>Range</b>personal</p><p><b>Target</b>you</p><p><b>Duration</b>10 minutes/level (D)</p><p>Powerful tendrils grow out of the bottom of your feet or footwear, partially anchoring you to the ground and making it more difficult for others to move you against your will. These tendrils dig into any surface, but leave no trace of your passing. You gain a +10 bonus to your CMD against bull rush, overrun, pull, push, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers, as well as any other effect that would move you from your current position (such as being swallowed whole) or would knock you prone. The tendrils slow your movement, however; your speed is reduced by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet). This spell has no effect if you are moving without touching the ground (climbing, flying, swimming, and so on).</p><h1>ANIMAL PURPOSE TRAINING</h1><p><b>School</b>enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; <b>Level</b>antipaladin 1, bard 2, druid 2, inquisitor 1, paladin 1, ranger 1, shaman 2, witch 1</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 minute</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S, M (a swatch of black cloth)</p><p><b>Range</b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><h1>ANIMAL PURPOSE TRAINING</h1><p><b>Target</b>one indifferent or friendly animal</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 hour/level</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>none; <b>Spell Resistance</b>yes</p><p>You instill the target animal with a general purpose (see the Handle Animal skill), which can be any purpose except combat training-fighting, guarding, heavy labor, hunting, performance, or riding. This purpose supersedes the animal's previous trained purpose and any tricks it knows. When the spell ends, the animal reverts to its previous trained purpose and known tricks.</p><h1>ANONYMOUS INTERACTION</h1><p><b>School</b>enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; <b>Level</b>bard 2, witch 2</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S</p><p><b>Range</b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><b>Target</b>one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart</p><p><b>Duration</b>permanent (see text)</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>Will negates; <b>Spell Resistance</b>yes</p><p>You cause the targets to forget all but the most general information about you. If they saw you or interacted with you, they still remember your presence and your general shape (such as humanoid), as well as the gist of your interactions with them (such as \"She was asking about the queen\"), but they don't remember specifically what you said, details of your appearance, or any identifying information about you. This spell targets any memories of you in the minute preceding its casting, but is otherwise permanent.</p><h1>ANTI-INCORPOREAL SHELL</h1><p><b>School</b>abjuration; <b>Level</b>cleric 4, shaman 4, witch 4</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 round</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S, DF</p><p><b>Range</b>10 ft.</p><p><b>Area</b>10-ft.-radius emanation centered on you</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 minute/level (D)</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>none; <b>Spell Resistance</b>yes</p><p>You bring into being a mobile, hemispherical energy field that incorporeal creatures cannot enter.</p><p>This spell can be used only defensively, not aggressively. Forcing an abjuration barrier against creatures that the spell keeps at bay collapses the barrier.</p><h1>AURA SIGHT</h1><p><b>School</b>divination; <b>Level</b>alchemist 3, cleric 3, inquisitor 4, shaman 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S</p><p><b>Range</b>personal</p><p><b>Target</b>you</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 minute/level (D)</p><p>This spell makes your eyes glow and allows you to see alignment auras within 120 feet of you. The effect is similar to that of a <i>detect chaos/evil/good/law</i>spell, but <i>aura sight</i>does not require concentration, and it discerns an aura's location and power more quickly.</p><p>You know the location and power of all chaotic, evil, good, and lawful auras within your sight. An aura's power depends on a creature's Hit Dice or an item's caster level, as noted in the description of the <i>detect evil</i>spell. If an item or a creature bearing an aura is in line of sight, you can attempt a Knowledge (religion) check to determine the aura's strength (one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a non-spell effect).</p><p><i>Aura sight</i>can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i>spell by a caster of 11th level or higher at a cost of 7,500 gp.</p><h1>BANSHEE BLAST</h1><p><b>School</b>necromancy [death, fear, mind-affecting, sonic]; <b>Level</b>sorcerer/wizard 6, witch 6</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S</p><p><b>Range</b>30 ft.</p><p><b>Area</b>cone-shaped burst</p><p><b>Duration</b>instantaneous and 1 round/level (see text)</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>Reflex half and Will negates (see text); <b>Spell Resistance</b>yes</p><p>You create a cone of spectral energy resembling screaming elven ghosts that deals 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d4); a successful Reflex save halves this damage. Any creature that fails its Reflex save must succeed at a Will save or become panicked for 1 round/level.</p><h1>BARROW HAZE</h1><p><b>School</b>necromancy; <b>Level</b>sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S</p><p><b>Range</b>medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p><p><b>Effect</b>fog spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 minute/level</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>none; <b>Spell Resistance</b>no</p><p><i>Barrow haze</i>creates a bank of fog similar to that created by <i>fog cloud</i>, except the vapors are black and they have a necromantic link to you. The vapors do not interfere with your vision. Because of your link to the haze, if any part of it is within 30 feet of you, any creatures within the haze count as in range for the purpose of using any of your hexes that have a maximum range of 30 feet.</p><p>For example, suppose you have the slumber hex, you are 25 feet from one edge of the haze, and an opponent is 40 feet farther away at the other extreme of the cloud. You can use your slumber hex on that opponent even though it is actually 65 feet away from you.</p><h1>BEASTSPEAK</h1><p><b>School</b>divination; <b>Level</b>druid 2, shaman 2, witch 2</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>S, DF</p><p><b>Range</b>personal</p><p><b>Target</b>you</p><p><b>Duration</b>10 minutes/level</p><p>When you're in the form of an animal (such as when you are using wild shape or are affected by a polymorph effect), you can speak normally, including when you cast spells with verbal components, and you sound like your normal self when you speak. You can cast this spell while you're in animal form, using animal-appropriate somatic components.</p><h1>BESTOW AURAS</h1><p><b>School</b>abjuration; <b>Level</b>antipaladin 3, paladin 3</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S</p><p><b>Range</b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><b>Target</b>one creature</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 minute/level (D)</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>Will negates (harmless); <b>Spell Resistance</b>yes</p><p>You transfer one or more of your paladin or antipaladin auras (such as aura of courage and aura of resolve) to another creature. You retain the personal effect of that aura, but the target becomes the center of the aura effect instead of you. For example, if you transfer your aura of courage, you remain immune to fear, but the target becomes the center of the aura that grants a +4 morale bonus on saves against fear effects. If an aura functions only when you are conscious, the transferred aura functions only when the target is conscious. If an aura functions only when you expend uses of another ability (such as with aura of justice or aura of vengeance), the transferred aura functions only if the target has that other ability and expends uses of it to activate the aura.</p><p>You cannot transfer an aura that affects only you (such as aura of good).</p><h1>BLADE LASH</h1><p><b>School</b>transmutation; <b>Level</b>bloodrager 1, magus 1</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S</p><p><b>Range</b>touch</p><p><b>Target</b>your melee weapon</p><p><b>Duration</b>instantaneous</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>none; <b>Spell Resistance</b>no</p><p>Your weapon elongates and becomes whiplike. As part of casting this spell, you can use this weapon to attempt a trip combat maneuver against one creature within 20 feet, and you gain a +10 bonus on your roll, after which the weapon returns to its previous form.</p><h1>BLAZING RAINBOW</h1><p><b>School</b>evocation [light]; <b>Level</b>druid 6</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 round</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S, M (a drop of rainwater)</p><p><b>Range</b>0 ft. or 10 ft./level</p><p><b>Effect</b>bow or bridge of light</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 minute/level or until discharged (see text)</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>none; <b>Spell Resistance</b>no</p><p>You create a spectrum of multicolored solid light that can be used for one of two effects.</p><p><i>Bow</i>: The spell creates a longbow or a shortbow appropriate for your size, and you are proficient in the use of this weapon. When drawn, the bow automatically creates a <i>+1 seeking brilliant energy arrow</i>; it cannot fire any other arrows. A creature struck by one of these arrows is surrounded by <i>faerie fire</i>and dazzled for 1 minute. This version of the spell ends when you have fired a number of arrows equal to your caster level.</p><p><i>Bridge</i>: The light forms a bridge or a ramp 5 feet wide and up to 10 feet long per caster level. Creatures on the bridge are dazzled. Allies gain a bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) on checks, saves, and to their CMD to resist being moved from the bridge against their will. Enemies take a penalty equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) on checks, on saves, and to CMD to resist being moved from the bridge against their will.</p><h1>BLESSED FIST</h1><p><b>School</b>transmutation [good]; <b>Level</b>cleric 1, paladin 1</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S</p><p><b>Range</b>touch</p><p><b>Target</b>creature touched</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 minute/level</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>none; <b>Spell Resistance</b>yes</p><p>The target is considered to be armed even when unarmed, so it doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity when it attacks foes with unarmed strikes. Its unarmed strikes can deal lethal or nonlethal damage (target's choice). If the target already has this ability (such as from the monk unarmed strike ability or the Improved Unarmed Strike feat), its unarmed strikes gain a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls, and they count as good-aligned weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><h1>BLOATBOMB</h1><p><b>School</b>necromancy [acid, death]; <b>Level</b>antipaladin 4, cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 4</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S</p><p><b>Range</b>touch</p><p><b>Target</b>living creature touched</p><p><b>Duration</b>instantaneous and 1 minute/level (see text)</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>Fortitude negates or Reflex half (see text); <b>Spell Resistance</b>yes</p><p>The target creature dies if it fails a Fortitude saving throw and its Hit Dice are no more than half your caster level. If it dies, its corpse rapidly putrefies. The next creature to touch the corpse within 1 minute per level of the target's death causes the corpse to explode in a 10-foot-radius burst, dealing 3d6 points of acid damage (Reflex half).</p><h1>BLOOD ARMOR</h1><p><b>School</b>transmutation; <b>Level</b>alchemist 2, bloodrager 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, summoner 2, witch 2</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S</p><p><b>Range</b>personal</p><p><b>Target</b>you</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 minute/level</p><p>Your blood becomes as hard as iron upon contact with air. Each time you take at least 5 points of piercing or slashing damage, your armor gains a +1 enhancement bonus to your AC. An outfit of regular clothing counts as armor that grants no AC bonus for the purpose of this spell. This enhancement bonus stacks with itself, but not with an existing enhancement bonus, to a maximum enhancement bonus of +5. This spell has no effect while you are underwater or in an environment that lacks air.</p><h1>BLOOD SENTINEL</h1><p><b>School</b>transmutation; <b>Level</b>alchemist 3, sorcerer/wizard 3</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S, M (a life-sized animal sculpture of a familiar made of clay, cloth, stone, or wood, plus mandrake root worth 25 gp)</p><p><b>Range</b>touch</p><p><b>Target</b>one animal sculpture</p><p><b>Duration</b>10 minutes/level</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>none; <b>Spell Resistance</b>no (harmless)</p><p>After casting this spell, you pour a few drops of your blood and saliva into the mouth of the animal sculpture material component, temporarily giving it life. The animal is bonded to you as if it were a familiar, and it has the abilities of a familiar (use your caster level as your effective wizard level to determine its abilities), but it does not grant you the Alertness feat or the special ability of its animal type. If your blood sentinel is slain, you take 2 points of Intelligence drain and the blood sentinel's body becomes a destroyed statue. This spell has no effect if you already have a familiar or another blood sentinel.</p><h1>BLURRED MOVEMENT</h1><p><b>School</b>illusion (glamer); <b>Level</b>alchemist 1, bard 1, bloodrager 1, magus 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, summoner 1</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S</p><p><b>Range</b>personal</p><p><b>Target</b>you</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 minute/level (D)</p><p>This spell functions as <i>blur</i>, except the blurring occurs only when you move at least 10 feet on your turn and ceases at the end of your movement. It is therefore mainly used to protect against attacks on your turn, such as attacks of opportunity. If you move at least twice your speed on your turn, the blurring lasts until the start of your next turn.</p><h1>BODY CAPACITANCE</h1><p><b>School</b>transmutation [electricity]; <b>Level</b>alchemist 1, sorcerer/wizard 1</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S, M (an iron coil)</p><p><b>Range</b>personal</p><p><b>Target</b>you</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 minute/level or until discharged (see text)</p><p>If you take electricity damage while this spell is active, some of the energy is stored on your skin, as per when holding the charge on a touch spell. You can release this stored electricity by making a melee touch attack. You gain a +3 bonus on the attack roll if your opponent is wearing metal armor, is carrying a metal weapon, or is made of metal. The target of your touch attack is dealt electricity damage equal to half the amount of electricity damage you took after you cast this spell (for example, if you saved for half damage against a <i>lightning bolt</i>and took only 15 points of electricity damage, your next touch attack deals 7 points of electricity damage). This spell is discharged once you hit with a melee touch attack to deliver its damage. If you take electricity damage multiple times while this spell is active, use the largest amount of electricity damage you took to determine your touch attack damage.</p><h1>BULLET WARD</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>School</b>abjuration; <b>Level</b>antipaladin 2, bard 2, inquisitor 2, paladin 2, ranger 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S, F (one to four adamantine bullets, each worth 61 gp)</p><p><b>Range</b>personal</p><p><b>Target</b>you</p><p><b>Duration</b>10 minutes/level or until discharged</p><p>You toss several adamantine bullets into the air, which then hover protectively nearby and intercept firearm attacks targeting you. The number of bullets protecting you is equal to half your caster level (maximum 4).</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>When an opponent takes a shot at you with a firearm, as an immediate action you can designate a hovering bullet to attempt to block the attack, increasing your AC against that attack by 10. Doing this destroys the adamantine bullet whether or not the attack hits. The spell is discharged when all affected adamantine bullets are destroyed or taken from you. Each adamantine bullet has AC 24, 20 hit points, and hardness 20.</p><h1>BUOYANCY</h1><p><b>School</b>transmutation; <b>Level</b>bard 2, shaman 2, sorcerer/ wizard 2, witch 2</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 immediate action</p><p><b>Components</b>V</p><p><b>Range</b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><b>Targets</b>one Medium or smaller object or creature/level, no two of which can be more than 20 ft. apart</p><p><b>Duration</b>up to 1 round/level (see text)</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>Will negates (harmless) or Will negates (object); <b>Spell Resistance</b>yes (object)</p><p>The affected targets become incredibly buoyant, floating naturally on any water at least 1 foot deep. An affected creature that deliberately tries to submerge must succeed at a DC 20 Swim check every round to stay underwater. If a target spends at least 1 round on dry land, the spell ends for that creature only.</p><h1>CHAMELEON STRIDE, GREATER</h1><p><b>School</b>illusion (glamer); <b>Level</b>ranger 3</p><p><b>Range</b>5 ft.</p><p><b>Area</b>allies in a 10-ft.-radius emanation centered on you</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 minute/level (see text)</p><p>This spell functions as <i>chameleon stride</i>(<i>Advanced Player's Guide</i>210), except it confers its bonuses upon all allies within 10 feet of you at the time the spell is cast. Those affected by this spell are able to see each other and themselves as if they were unaffected by the spell. If an affected creature moves out of the area, it loses the benefit of the spell.

The growing stalk anchors itself to sturdy objects such as walls or ceilings, and grows around objects that do not fully obstruct its square (such as tree branches), but is stopped by solid obstacles. The beanstalk provides numerous hand- and footholds (Climb DC 5). The beanstalk can support up to 200 pounds plus 50 pounds per caster level, or double that amount if anchored on its upper end. If it anchors itself to a sturdy mobile object (such as a ship or a siege engine), breaking the object free requires a DC 23 Strength check or cutting through the beanstalk (hardness 2, hp 40).</p><p>if the ground is capable of supporting plant life, the beanstalk continues to live as a normal plant, and it produces nutritious (if unappetizing) beans. Otherwise, the plant dies after 1d6 hours; its husk remains as durable as a small tree.</p><h1>COMPANION LIFE LINK</h1><p><b>School</b>necromancy; <b>Level</b>druid 2, ranger 2, sorcerer/ wizard 2, witch 2</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Component</b>V, S, M/DF (a drop of eidolon ichor)</p><p><b>Range</b>touch</p><p><b>Target</b>one of your animal companions or your familiar</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 minute/level (see text)</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>Fortitude negates (harmless); <b>Spell Resistance</b>yes (harmless)</p><p>You create a life link between yourself and the target. You sense whenever the target is wounded and are made immediately aware if the target is slain. If you are wounded or slain, the target is made aware. As a free action, you can call out to the target, causing it to return to you (if able and willing); doing this ends the spell.</p><h1>CONTINGENT ACTION</h1><p><b>School</b>evocation; <b>Level</b>bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 minute</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S</p><p><b>Range</b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><b>Target</b>one willing creature</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 minute/level (D) or until discharged</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>Will negates (harmless); <b>Spell Resistance</b>yes (harmless)</p><p>The target gains an extra action that becomes available when a condition that you dictate is met. At the time of casting, you dictate the condition, and the target specifies a readied action that occurs when triggered by this condition.</p><p>The condition needed to trigger the readied action must be clear, although it can be general. If a complicated or convoluted condition is prescribed, the whole combination might fail when triggered. For example, suppose the trigger and the action are stated as \"if the target is attacked while he is not holding a weapon, he draws a weapon.\" if the target has no weapon to draw when the trigger occurs, the action fails. If the trigger and the action are \"if an ally within 20 feet falls unconscious, the target moves to a space adjacent to that ally\" but the target is chained to a wall when the trigger occurs and can't reach the unconscious ally, the action fails.</p><p>The readied action must be a standard, a move, or a swift action, and it cannot be used to cast a spell or use a supernatural ability. This action counts as a readied action and doesn't count toward the number of actions the creature can take in a round. When the condition occurs, the target can decide not to use the readied action. Once the condition is triggered, the spell is discharged-whether or not the target uses the readied action or the action is successful.</p><p>This spell counts as a <i>contingency</i>spell for the purpose of having multiple contingent effects on a creature at the same time.</p><h1>CONTINGENT SCROLL</h1><p><b>School</b>evocation; <b>Level</b>bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>10 minutes</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S, M (the scroll to be triggered; see text), F (a platinum quill worth 100 gp)</p><p><b>Range</b>personal</p><p><b>Target</b>you</p><p><b>Duration</b>10 minutes/level (D) or until discharged</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>Will negates (harmless); <b>Spell Resistance</b>yes (harmless)</p><p>You transfer the power of a scroll to the target so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate. Casting this spell destroys the scroll, but allows the spell in it to be triggered in a manner similar to the <i>contingency</i>spell. The spell on the scroll must be a spell on your spell list, it must affect the target of this spell (the target of this spell is considered the caster of the scroll), and its level must be no higher than one-fourth your caster level (maximum 5th level).</p><p>The writing on the scroll appears on the target's skin in any location you desire; this writing does not harm or interfere with the target in any way, and doesn't need to be on exposed skin to function. For example, you could make the writing appear under a target's clothing. The writing on the target's skin can be deciphered and identified as if it were the scroll it was copied from. Damaging the target has no effect on the stored spell, but effects such as <i>erase</i>that target magical writing can affect it.</p><p>The condition needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although it can be general. In all cases, this spell immediately brings into effect the scroll's spell, the latter being effectively cast instantaneously when the trigger occurs. If a complicated or convoluted condition is prescribed, the whole spell combination (the <i>contingent scroll</i>and the scroll's spell) might fail when triggered. The scroll's spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it occur to at that moment. This spell counts as a <i>contingency</i>spell for the purpose of having multiple contingent effects on a creature at the same time.</p><h1>CREEPING ICE</h1><p><b>School</b>evocation [cold]; <b>Level</b>druid 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, summoner 3</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S</p><p><b>Range</b>medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p><p><b>Effect</b>anchored plane of ice, up to one 10-ft. square/level</p><p><b>Duration</b>10 minutes/level</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>Reflex negates (see text); <b>Spell Resistance</b>yes</p><p>This spell covers the floor, the ground, or some other calm horizontal surface (such as a placid lake or a gentle river) with a sheet of slowly growing ice. The initial sheet of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. The ice is hard, strong, and opaque, and is 1 inch thick per caster level. The ice is strong enough to support the weight of a typical horse, making it possible for creatures to cross a body of water.</p><p>Each 10-foot square of ice has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the ice automatically. A section of ice whose hit points drop to 0 is destroyed, leaving an area of ice chunks, slush, and snow that counts as difficult terrain. If a creature tries to break through the ice with a single attack, the DC of the Strength check is 15 + your caster level.</p><p>Each round on your turn, the sheet of ice grows 1 foot in all directions except toward you. This growth is slow enough that any creature in the area has time to move out of the way or step onto the ice. If the growing ice completely covers a creature's square, the creature must choose whether it moves onto the sheet of ice, is knocked prone on the sheet of ice, or is bull rushed into an adjacent square.</p><h1>CRIMSON CONFESSION</h1><p><b>School</b>abjuration; <b>Level</b>sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>10 minutes</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S</p><p><b>Range</b>touch</p><p><b>Target or Area</b>object touched or up to 1 sq. ft.</p><p><b>Duration</b>permanent and 1 hour/level (see text)</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>Fortitude negates; <b>Spell Resistance</b>yes</p><p>You ward an object or an area with your personal rune or mark.

This coloring cannot be washed away, but it can be dispelled.</p><p><i>See invisibility</i>, <i>true seeing</i>, a <i>gem of seeing</i>, or a <i>robe of eyes</i>likewise allows the user to see an invisible mark.

Furthermore, it catches on fire, taking 2d6 points of fire damage per round at the end of its turn each round until the creature dies or is quenched as normal (<i>Core Rulebook</i>444).

As a swift action, you can teleport from your current location to either of the designated locations as if you had cast <i>dimension door</i>. The spell is discharged once you have used it to teleport a number of times equal to one-fourth your caster level (maximum 5 times).</p><h1>DISABLE CONSTRUCT</h1><p><b>School</b>transmutation; <b>Level</b>alchemist 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S</p><p><b>Range</b>touch</p><p><b>Target</b>construct touched</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 round/level (D)</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>Will negates; <b>Spell Resistance</b>no</p><p>You can make a melee touch attack to send a pulse into the target, interfering with the magic that endows it with life.

You learn about one relative per round you concentrate on the target. For example, you might learn that the target's father's name is Jarn, the father lives on a nearby farm, and the target and his father don't get along. Since this spell reads the target's mind, you can learn only what the target knows or believes.</p><h1>DISGUISE WEAPON</h1><p><b>School</b>illusion (glamer); <b>Level</b>bard 1, magus 1, sorcerer/ wizard 1, witch 1</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 round</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S</p><p><b>Range</b>touch</p><p><b>Target</b>manufactured weapon touched</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 hour/level (D)</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>none; <b>Spell Resistance</b>no</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>You make one manufactured weapon look like a different manufactured weapon of the same size and relative encumbrance (light, one-handed, or two-handed). For example, you could make a Small greatsword look like a Small quarterstaff, a Medium club, or a Large dagger. Even the appearance of an improvised weapon is possible. The extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could add or obscure a minor feature or make the item look like it is composed of different materials (stone, wood, adamantine, and so on). The spell does not provide any of the abilities of the chosen form, nor does it alter the perceived tactile or audible properties of the item or how it is wielded. A creature that interacts with the glamer may attempt a Will save to recognize it as an illusion.</p><h1>ENCHANTMENT FOIL</h1><p><b>School</b>abjuration; <b>Level</b>alchemist 4, cleric 4, inquisitor 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 4</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S</p><p><b>Range</b>personal</p><p><b>Target</b>you</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 hour/level (see text)</p><p>You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against enchantment effects.

Furthermore, you can choose to act as if you had failed your saving throw. If you do so, you gain a +20 bonus on Bluff checks to convince others that you failed your save and are under the enchantment's effects. A creature that attempts to use magic to detect this ruse or to make you speak truthfully about it must succeed at a caster level check (DC 15 + your caster level) to do so.</p><h1>ENEMY INSIGHT</h1><p><b>School</b>divination; <b>Level</b>ranger 2</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S, DF</p><p><b>Range</b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><b>Targets</b>you plus one willing creature/3 levels, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 minute/level</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>none; <b>Spell Resistance</b>no</p><p>You forge a mental bond between yourself and the other targets, each of which must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher.

The entry point looks like a circle of toadstools enclosing a 10-foot square. Only those you designate can enter the meadow before you do, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind you when you enter. You can open it again from your own side at will. Once visitors have passed through the entry point, they find themselves in an idyllic twilight meadow surrounded by an impassable grove of fruit and nut trees. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.</p><p>You can configure the meadow in any shape you desire, to the limit of the spell's effect. The place is comfortable and temperate. The trees can provide enough food to sustain four people per caster level for a day. A staff of near-transparent animal or feylike servants (as many as two per caster level) wait upon all who enter. The servants function as <i>unseen servant</i>spells except they are visible and can go anywhere in the meadow.</p><p>Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the meadow, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond.</p><h1>FAMILIAR DOUBLE</h1><p><b>School</b>illusion (shadow) [shadow]; <b>Level</b>witch 7</p><p>This spell functions as <i>project image</i>, except the image appears in your familiar's square and moves when your familiar moves.</p><h1>FEAST ON FEAR</h1><p><b>School</b>necromancy [emotion, fear, mind-affecting]; <b>Level</b>bard 4, shaman 5, sorcerer/wizard 5, witch 5</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S</p><p><b>Range</b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><b>Targets</b>one or more living creatures (see text)</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 round/level</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>Fortitude negates; <b>Spell Resistance</b>yes</p><p>Each round, as a standard action, you can target a single living creature of up to 9 HD and strike it with terrifying waves of power. If the target fails its saving throw, it becomes panicked for 1d4 rounds, and you gain 5 temporary hit points (which disappear after 1 hour). After the panic ends, the creature remains shaken for 10 minutes per caster level, and it automatically becomes panicked again if it comes within sight of you during that time.</p><p>These temporary hit points stack if they come from different creatures.</p><h1>FLAMING SPHERE, GREATER</h1><p><b>School</b>evocation [fire]; <b>Level</b>bloodrager 4, druid 4, magus 4, sorcerer/wizard 4</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>Reflex negates (see text); <b>Spell Resistance</b>yes</p><p>This spell functions as <i>flaming sphere</i>, except it deals 6d6 points of fire damage to any creature it strikes.

A creature must succeed at a saving throw each time it attempts to use the sticky item; otherwise, the item becomes stuck to the creature. Sticky armor or clothing imposes upon the wearer a -10 circumstance penalty on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks to escape a grapple, and to the wearer's CMD to avoid being grappled.</p><h1>GUARDIAN OF FAITH</h1><p><b>School</b>abjuration [see text]; <b>Level</b>cleric 4, paladin 4</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S, M (parchment with a holy text written on it)</p><p><b>Range</b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><b>Target</b>one ally</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 minute/level</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>Will negates (harmless); <b>Spell Resistance</b>no</p><p>The target gains the benefit of <i>shield of faith</i>and your choice of <i>protection from chaos</i>, <i>evil</i>, <i>good</i>, or <i>law</i>.

For example, normally after you target a creature with a charm hex, you cannot target it again for 1 day. But after casting this spell on a creature, you could try the charm hex repeatedly as long as the spell persists. The end of this spell has no effect on any active or ongoing hex on a creature.

Any creature affected by a rage effect (barbarian's rage, bloodrager's bloodrage, blood rage bloodrager's bloodrage, blood rage monster ability, <i>rage</i>spell, skald's inspired rage raging song, and so on) that strikes you with a melee attack must attempt a Will saving throw, without the rage effect's bonus to Will; failure means the rage effect ends (as if it were dispelled or the creature voluntarily ended it, as appropriate).</p><p>if you become affected by a rage effect while this spell is active, this spell immediately ends.

Any creature that sees the target can attempt a DC 15 Knowledge (religion) check to discern the target's alignment, even if the mark is covered.

The target can visualize this page as easily as looking at it in person, including minute details visible to close scrutiny by the naked eye. The memory of the page includes text and images, such as a drawing or a map. Someone unfamiliar with the language on the page (or even an illiterate person) could relay what is written simply by copying the shapes of the letters so another person can read them.</p><p>The maximum number of pages that a particular target can memorize through repeated castings of this spell is equal to the target's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1); any attempts beyond this limit have no effect, although the target's memory of a page could be erased (using <i>modify memory</i>or a similar effect) to effectively make room for a different one.</p><p>A creature that memorizes magical writing (such as a scroll or a page from a spellbook) cannot borrow, duplicate, or retain any of the magic in the writing. However, this spell would allow a wizard to copy a spell into his spellbook so he could prepare it from his book (assuming the spell takes up only one page in a spellbook).</p><h1>MINDLOCKED MESSENGER</h1><p><b>School</b>enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent, mind-affecting]; <b>Level</b>bard 2, shaman 3, sorcerer/ wizard 3, witch 3</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>10 minutes</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S</p><p><b>Range</b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><b>Target</b>one willing living creature</p><p><b>Duration</b>permanent until discharged (see text)</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>Will negates (harmless); <b>Spell Resistance</b>yes (harmless)</p><p>You speak a short message (up to 10 words per caster level), implanting both it and the identity of the message's intended recipient in the mind of a willing creature. The creature is aware of the message and who the recipient is. Any attempt to speak, write, or otherwise communicate the message to anyone other than its intended recipient causes the target to forget the message for 1d6 minutes. Attempts to read the target's mind (such as with <i>detect thoughts</i>) or to force the target to reveal the message (such as with torture or magical compulsion) likewise cause temporary amnesia regarding the message.</p><p>The target can communicate the message only to someone it believes is the intended recipient, which means that disguises, illusions, and polymorph effects might fool the target into delivering the message. Once the target communicates the message, the message is permanently erased from the target's memory.</p><h1>MIRROR HIDEAWAY</h1><p><b>School</b>transmutation; <b>Level</b>sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S, M (a glass or metal marble and a twisted loop of parchment)</p><p><b>Range</b>touch</p><p><b>Target</b>one mirror</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 hour/level (D)</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>none; <b>Spell Resistance</b>no</p><p>You transform a mirror into a portal to an extradimensional space. The space can hold as many as eight Medium creatures. Creatures that enter this space are hidden and beyond the reach of spells (including divinations), unless those spells work across planes. If the mirror is covered (such as by a cloth, or by being placed face down or against a wall), the portal becomes inactive. If the mirror is broken or moved more than 5 feet from where it was when you cast the spell, the spell ends; any creatures within the extradimensional space are expelled from it (see below) and become nauseated for 1d6 rounds.</p><p>Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the space can see and hear through it as if looking through an open window the same size as the mirror. Creatures outside the extradimensional space see only what is normally reflected in the mirror. Any creature in the space can make itself visible in the reflection of the mirror for 1 round at a time; however, creatures outside the space cannot hear any sounds that originate inside.</p><p>Anything inside the extradimensional space is expelled when the spell ends (even if the mirror is covered). Only one creature at a time can enter the mirror, and a creature can enter only if it can fit through an opening the same size as the mirror. For example, a hand mirror isn't big enough for a Small or larger creature to use it as a portal. Objects can enter the extradimensional space only if brought by a creature able to fully pass through the mirror.</p><h1>MIRROR POLISH</h1><p><b>School</b>transmutation; <b>Level</b>sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S, M (a soft cloth)</p><p><b>Range</b>touch</p><p><b>Target</b>one metal item of up to 1 sq. ft.</p><p><b>Duration</b>instantaneous</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>yes (object); <b>Spell Resistance</b>yes (object)</p><p>You polish a metal item until it is reflective enough to be used as a mirror. This spell does not prevent the item from later being affected by damage or corrosion that would ruin the mirrored surface. The spell can be cast only on a metal item with a fairly smooth and contiguous surface, such as a breastplate, a helm, a shield, or a sword, but not a mace, chainmail, or scale mail.</p><h1>MIRROR TRANSPORT</h1><p><b>School</b>transmutation; <b>Level</b>sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 4</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S, M (a glass or metal marble and a twisted loop of parchment)</p><p><b>Range</b>touch</p><p><b>Target</b>one mirror</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 hour/level (D)</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>yes (object); <b>Spell Resistance</b>yes (object)</p><p>This spell functions as <i>mirror hideaway</i>, except any creature that enters the target mirror can spend a swift action to exit through another mirror within 500 feet as if using <i>dimension door</i>; this is a one-way transport. The creature can exit through a mirror only if it could fit through an opening the same size as the mirror.

A direct hit deals 2d6 points of fire damage. Every creature within 5 feet of where the ball hits takes 1d6 points of fire damage from the splash (Reflex half). Each of these creatures takes an additional 1d6 points of fire damage on its turn for the next 1d3 rounds, unless it is cooled off (with water, snow, or any effect that deals 5 or more points of cold damage).</p><h1>MONKEY FISH</h1><p><b>School</b>transmutation; <b>Level</b>alchemist 1, druid 1, magus 1, shaman 1, sorcerer/wizard 1</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S</p><p><b>Range</b>personal</p><p><b>Target</b>you</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 minute/level (D)</p><p>Your hands and feet alter to make you better at climbing and swimming.

The targets have a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells with verbal components or using abilities that rely on audible components (such as some bardic performances). This spell does not hamper the targets' ability to hear other sounds and provides no protection against language-dependent or sonic spells and effects.</p><h1>NAUSEATING DART</h1><p><b>School</b>conjuration (creation) [poison]; <b>Level</b>druid 1, witch 1</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>S, DF</p><p><b>Range</b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><b>Effect</b>one poisonous stinger</p><p><b>Duration</b>instantaneous</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>Fortitude partial (see text); <b>Spell Resistance</b>no</p><p>You spit a poisonous stinger around the size of a quill at a creature within range, as though you had fired a dart from a blowgun.

Forms of harm that do not involve the loss of hit points, such as charm effects, temporary ability damage, level drain, and death effects, are not affected. If the creature suffers a reduction of hit points from a lowered Constitution score, you cannot take that damage on behalf of your companion creature because it is not hit point damage.

(see text)</p><p><b>Target</b>one haunt</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 minute/level</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>Will negates (see text); <b>Spell Resistance</b>no</p><p>You stir a haunt (<i>Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide</i>242) to a limited sense of awareness and consciousness, enabling it to answer questions. The spell's range must reach any square within 10 feet of the haunt's area. You must be aware of the haunt prior to casting the spell, and casting the spell does not trigger the haunt. You can ask one question per 2 caster levels. The haunt's knowledge is limited to what its original creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke. A haunt often remembers the circumstance that led to its existence (though this recollection might be from the original victim's perspective and therefore not objective), what triggers it, and how it can be laid to rest (destroyed). Answers are brief, cryptic, or repetitive, especially if the haunt is angry and vindictive.</p><p>If the haunt's alignment is more than one step away from yours, the haunt can attempt a Will save to resist the spell. A haunt's Will save modifier is equal to 3 + the haunt's CR. If the save is successful, the haunt can refuse to answer your questions or attempt to deceive you (using Bluff). A haunt's Bluff modifier equals its CR (minimum +0) or might be determined by the GM based upon the original victim. The haunt can speak only about what it knew in life and the circumstances by which it became a haunt. It cannot answer any questions that pertain to events that occurred after it was created. A neutral or good haunt might cooperate with similarly aligned creatures in order to end its suffering.</p><p>If a haunt has been subject to this spell within the past week, a new casting of this spell on it fails. You can cast this on a haunt that has been deceased for any amount of time. Unlike a corpse affected by <i>speak with dead</i>, a haunt wants to express itself, if only to share its pain or to cause mischief.</p><h1>SPELLCRASH</h1><p><b>School</b>abjuration; <b>Level</b>cleric 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, witch 6</p><p>This spell functions as <i>lesser spellcrash</i>, except it affects 5th-level or lower prepared spells or spell slots.</p><h1>SPELLCRASH, GREATER</h1><p><b>School</b>abjuration; <b>Level</b>cleric 8, sorcerer/wizard 8, witch 8</p><p>This spell functions as <i>lesser spellcrash</i>, except it affects 7th-level or lower prepared spells or spell slots.</p><h1>SPELLCRASH, LESSER</h1><p><b>School</b>abjuration; <b>Level</b>cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 4</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S</p><p><b>Range</b>medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p><p><b>Target</b>one creature</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 round/level</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>Will negates; see text; <b>Spell Resistance</b>yes</p><p>You create a discordant blast of energy that disrupts the target's available magic each round at the start of its turn.</p><p>If the target prepares spells, it must choose one of its prepared 3rd-level spells, which is immediately lost; if the target has no 3rd-level spells prepared, it must lose a 2nd-level spell it has prepared (progressing down to a 1st-level spell if it has no 2nd-level spells prepared).</p><p>If the target is a spontaneous spellcaster, it loses one of its available 3rd-level spell slots; if the target has no available 3rd-level spell slots, it must lose a 2nd-level spell slot (progressing down to a 1st-level spell slot if it has no 2nd-level spell slots available).</p><p>There is no initial saving throw for this spell, but the target can attempt a Will save each round at the end of its turn.</p><p>If the target has more than one spellcasting class, choose one at random to be affected.

Each of the closest 1d4+1 predatory creatures within 30 feet must succeed at a Will save or start attacking the target (animals with the scent ability are affected if within 60 feet). If the predator is an animal, it can be called away from the target by a handler using the down trick (<i>Core Rulebook</i>97) or any effect that suspends or dispels emotion or rage effects.</p><p>This spell has no effect on constructs, undead, or creatures with the unnatural aura ability or effects that repel animals.</p><h1>STONE DISCUS</h1><p><b>School</b>conjuration (creation) [earth], <b>Level</b>bloodrager 2, druid 2, magus 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S, M (a pinch of earth or metal)</p><p><b>Range</b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><b>Effect</b>one or more stone discuses</p><p><b>Duration</b>instantaneous</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>none; <b>Spell Resistance</b>no</p><p>You create a stone discus, which flies at an enemy.

For each discus you create, you decide whether its edge is blunt (and deals bludgeoning damage) or sharp (and deals slashing damage). Each discus requires a ranged attack to hit and deals 4d6 points of damage. The discuses can be launched at more than one target, but all must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and launched simultaneously.</p><p>At caster level 5th, the discuses count as magic and silver.

The next time a creature succeeds at a sunder combat maneuver against the target, the attacker's weapon takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). If the attacker used a natural weapon for the sunder, the attacker takes half this damage. Spell resistance applies to this damage. The attacker can attempt a Fortitude save to halve this damage.</p><p>The ward on the target counts as a magical trap and can be detected and disabled as such.</p><h1>SUNDERING SHARDS</h1><p><b>School</b>transmutation; <b>Level</b>bloodrager 1, magus 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V</p><p><b>Range</b>touch</p><p><b>Target</b>melee weapon touched</p><p><b>Duration</b>1 hour/level or until discharged</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>Reflex negates (see text); <b>Spell Resistance</b>yes</p><p>You channel power into a melee weapon.

Any creature (other than the wielder of the weapon targeted by this spell) adjacent to that creature must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or take 1d6 points of piercing and slashing damage from flying shards. The shards also count as whatever special materials the sundered item was made of (for example, the shards from a shattered cold iron weapon are cold iron).

If you throw the javelin, another one appears in your hand. Any javelin that leaves your grasp disappears at the end of your turn. Each javelin attack you make reduces the spell's remaining duration by 1 minute. If an attack reduces the remaining duration to 0 minutes or fewer, the spell ends after that attack resolves.</p><h1>THORNY ENTANGLEMENT</h1><p><b>School</b>transmutation; <b>Level</b>druid 3, ranger 3, shaman 3, witch 3</p><p><b>Casting Time</b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components</b>V, S, DF</p><p><b>Saving Throw</b>Reflex partial (see text); <b>Spell Resistance</b>no</p><p>This spell functions as <i>entangle</i>, except the plants also grow thorns and can fling them up to 15 feet.

The plants use your caster level as their base attack bonus and add your spellcasting ability score modifier (Intelligence for witches; Wisdom for druids, rangers, and shamans) to the attack roll. A volley of thorns counts as a thrown weapon and deals 2d6 points of piercing damage on a successful hit.

This trip attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity. This spell has no effect if you cannot reach the ground or floor, or if your target is not in contact with the ground or floor.</p><h1>THUNDERSTOMP, GREATER</h1><p><b>School</b>evocation [earth]; <b>Level</b>bloodrager 3, druid 3, magus 3, ranger 3, sorcerer/wizard 3</p><p><b>Range</b>60 ft.</p><p><b>Area</b>60-ft. line</p><p>This spell functions as <i>thunderstomp</i>, except as noted, and that it affects all creatures in the area, regardless of size.

This light counts as <i>daylight</i>for the purpose of affecting darkness effects (and vice versa). If the emanation enters an area under the effect of magical darkness (or vice versa), both effects are temporarily negated so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect.

Any creature you strike with the whip takes swarm damage as if it were attacked by a spider swarm (1d6 points of damage plus poison and distraction; <i>Bestiary</i>258). The swarm whip is able to damage creatures with armor or natural armor, even if a normal whip could not. It cannot be used to make bull rush, grapple, or trip attacks, and (unlike a swarm) it is subject to a miss chance for concealment and cover.</p><p>The whip is immune to all weapon damage, is never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage, and is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as <i>disintegrate</i>). The whip takes half again as much damage from spells or effects that affect an area, but since it is considered part of your gear, it takes damage only if you fail a saving throw with a roll of a 1 or if it is specifically targeted by an opponent. The whip does not have a swarm's susceptibility to high winds.</p><p>As a standard action, you can transform the whip into a spider swarm (all squares of the swarm must be within 15 feet of you); thereafter it functions as <i>summon swarm</i>.

While the majority of skalds use their songs to drive their allies into a frenzy of rage, the rage powers they employ vary from tribe to tribe and skald to skald. Other skalds use their songs and magic to call warriors of the great beyond, or to take on aspects of the wild.</p><h1>RAGE POWERS</h1><p>The following new rage powers can be taken by any barbarian or skald who meets the prerequisites.</p><p><b>Battle Roar (Su)</b>: When the character successfully demoralizes an opponent using intimidating glare, he also deals 1d6 points of sonic damage to that opponent. A character must be at least 6th level and have the intimidating glare rage power to select this rage power.</p><p><b>Fierce Fortitude (Ex)</b>: The character gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against diseases and poison. A skald must be trained in Intimidate to select this rage power.</p><p><b>Linnorm Death Curse, Cairn (Su)</b>: The character channels the power of a cairn linnorm. The character's melee attacks deal an additional 1 point of negative energy damage. If the character is knocked unconscious or killed by an attack or a spell, the attacker suffers the curse of decay (Will negates). A character must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</p><p><i>Curse of Decay</i>: <i>save</i>Will DC = 10 + 1/2 character's class level + character's Charisma modifier; <i>effect</i>target takes 1 point of Con damage per day and ages at the rate of 1 year per day (eventually incurring all of the penalties of old age but none of the bonuses).</p><p><b>Linnorm Death Curse, Crag (Su)</b>: The character channels the power of a crag linnorm. The character's melee attacks deal an additional 1 point of fire damage.

The character's melee attacks deal an additional 1 point of cold damage. If the character is knocked unconscious or killed by an attack or a spell, the attacker suffers the curse of frost (Will negates). A character must be at least 4th level to select this rage power.</p><p><i>Curse of Frost</i>: <i>save</i>Will DC = 10 + 1/2 character's class level + character's Charisma modifier; <i>effect</i>target gains vulnerability to cold.</p><p><b>Linnorm Death Curse, Taiga (Su)</b>: The character channels the power of a taiga linnorm. The character's melee attacks deal an additional 1 point of electricity damage. If the character is knocked unconscious or killed by an attack or a spell, the attacker suffers the curse of electricity (Will negates). A character must be at least 4th level to select this rage power.</p><p><i>Curse of Electricity</i>: <i>save</i>Will DC = 10 + 1/2 character's class level + character's Charisma modifier; <i>effect</i>target gains vulnerability to electricity.</p><p><b>Linnorm Death Curse, Tarn (Su)</b>: The character channels the power of a tarn linnorm.

If she uses the charge action, she can use this flight as part of her movement during the charge. A character must be at least 6th level and have the raging leaper rage power to select this rage power.</p><p><b>Ultimate Clarity (Su)</b>: Once per rage, the character can refine her senses, seeing through normal and magical darkness (including from magical effects such as <i>blur</i>and <i>displacement</i>), invisibility, and illusions; she can also discern the exact locations of creatures with concealment. This lasts for 1 round. A character must be at least 6th level and have the moment of clarity and perfect clarity rage powers to select this rage power. The character does not need to be using moment of clarity to use this rage power.</p><h1>FATED CHAMPION (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Many cultures see fate as a limit that is both stifling and unwanted, regardless of the destiny that lurks in the days and years ahead. Among cultures where skalds are the keepers of lore and wisdom, there are those who learn to read the winds of fate and take up the mantle of the fated champion, knowing and embracing their destined paths with strength born of conviction.</p><p><b>Watcher of the Weave (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, a fated champion learns to see the tapestry of events moments before it is woven. He gains an insight bonus on initiative checks equal to 1/2 his skald level. This ability replaces well-versed.</p><p><b>Far Seer (Su)</b>: At 5th level, a fated champion learns a method of spell kenning that is especially suited for divining and understanding the future, but not for directly harming opponents. For the purpose of determining what level of spell slot he expends when using spell kenning, the skald treats spells that predict the future (such as <i>augury</i>and <i>divination</i>) as one spell level lower (minimum spell level 1st), and treats spells that deal damage as one spell level higher. This ability alters the spell kenning class feature.</p><p><b>Shield of Foresight (Su)</b>: At 10th level, a fated champion's certainty of his own fate grants him the ability to stare down fear and remain unbowed. When using raging song, he is immune to fear effects, and allies affected by his raging song gain a +5 bonus on saves against fear effects. This ability replaces the dirge of doom raging song.</p><p><b>Not This Day (Su)</b>: At 20th level, the fated champion gains the ability to reweave the strands of fate. As an immediate action, he can expend 10 rounds of raging song to either reroll a saving throw or force an opponent to reroll an attack roll. The decision to use this ability must be made before the result of the initial roll is revealed, and the champion or his opponent must take the result of the reroll. This ability replaces master skald.</p><p><b>Rage Powers</b>: The following rage powers complement the fated champion archetype: boasting taunt(APG), clear mind, eater of magic(UC), fierce fortitude*, flesh wound(APG), guarded life(APG), intimidating glare, linnorm death curse* (cairn, tarn), and renewed vitality(UC). (Those with asterisks [*] are described in the Rage Powers section on page 114.)</p><h1>HERALD OF THE HORN (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Even the loudest voice can often times be drowned out by the din of battle. Whether with the polished metal trumpet of a standing army or the crude curved animal horn of savage raiders, a herald of the horn sounds his raging song with thunderous blasts, which can bolster allies or shatter castle walls.</p><p><b>Arcane Bond (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a herald of the horn forms a powerful bond with a horn (musical instrument). This bond functions as an arcane bloodline sorcerer's arcane bond with an object. Like a weapon, wand, or staff, the horn must be held in one hand when the herald of the horn casts skald spells. This ability replaces scribe scroll.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Rousing Retort (Su)</b>: At 5th level, a herald of the horn can use raging song to free allies from enchantment effects and fear. When beginning a raging song, he can expend 4 rounds of that ability to grant all allies within 60 feet a new saving throw against an ongoing enchantment or fear effect. The allies gain a +2 bonus on this new saving throw. This ability replaces the first daily use of spell kenning gained at 5th level.</p><p><b>Horn Call (Su)</b>: At 7th level, a herald's horn enhances his sonic spells. If a skald spell with the sonic descriptor is cast using the horn, its DC increases by 1. The DC increases by an additional 1 at 13th level and again at 19th level. This ability replaces lore master.</p><p><b>Crumbling Blast (Su)</b>: At 11th level, a herald of the horn can use his horn to create a devastating shock wave of energy. Once per day, he can sound a note on the horn that functions as a <i>horn of blasting</i>(DC = 10 + 1/2 the herald of the horn's skald level + his Charisma modifier). At 17th level, the herald of the horn can use this ability twice per day, and it functions as a <i>greater horn of blasting</i>. Unlike an actual <i>horn of blasting</i>, this ability does not carry the risk of destroying the horn. This ability replaces the second and third daily uses of spell kenning gained at 11th and 17th levels.</p><p><b>Rage Powers</b>: The following rage powers complement the herald of the horn archetype: battle roar*, energy absorption(APG), energy eruption(APG), fearless rage, knockback, knockdown(APG), smasher(APG), and swift foot. (Those with asterisks [*] are listed in the Rage Powers section on page 1114.)</p><h1>SPELL WARRIOR (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>The spell warrior uses his arcane knowledge rather than his rage to turn the tide of battle in favor of himself and his allies. With a clash of bracers and a sonorous chant, the spell warrior's song reaches out to touch the weapons of his allies, lending them arcane power. While his song does not inspire rage, he can use the power of his music to enchant the weapons of his allies and counter the spells of his foes.</p><p><b>Improved Counterspell</b>: At 1st level, the spell warrior receives Improved Counterspell as a bonus feat. This ability replaces scribe scroll.</p><p><b>Weapon Song (Su)</b>: A spell warrior gains the following raging song, allowing him to grant enhancement bonuses and special powers to his ally's weapons.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><i>Enhance Weapons (Su)</i>: At 1st level, the spell warrior can grant a +1 enhancement bonus to the weapons (including ammunition) of allies within 60 feet. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, this enhancement bonus increases by 1. The maximum bonus gained is based upon the number of weapons affected: +5 for one weapon, +4 for two weapons, +3 for three weapons, or +2 for four or more weapons. Fifty pieces of ammunition count as one weapon for this purpose. The wielder of a weapon enhanced by this raging song counts as if she were under the effect of an inspired rage raging song for all purposes involving the skald's rage powers.</p><p>These bonuses can also be used to add any of the following weapon special abilities to the weapons enhanced by this ability: <i>dancing</i>, <i>defending</i>, <i>distance</i>, <i>flaming</i>, <i>frost</i>, <i>ghost touch</i>, <i>keen</i>, <i>mighty cleaving</i>, <i>returning</i>, <i>shock</i>, <i>seeking</i>, or <i>speed</i>. Adding any of these special abilities consumes an amount of bonus equal to the special ability's base price modifier (see Table 15-9: Melee Weapon Special Abilities on page 469 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>). These enhancement bonuses and special abilities overlap with any enhancements or special abilities the weapon already has, and duplicate special abilities do not stack. If an affected weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other special abilities can be.</p><p>The bonus and special abilities granted by this raging song are determined when the song begins, and cannot be changed until the raging song ends and another is begun. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. This ability replaces the inspired rage raging song.</p><p><b>Greater Counterspell (Su)</b>: At 5th level, the spell warrior gains increased versatility when attempting to counteract enemy spellcasting. When counterspelling, he can expend two skald spell slots of the same level or higher than the opponent's spell, regardless of the school of that spell.</p><p>At 11th level, when counterspelling an opponent's spell, the spell warrior has to expend only one skald spell slot of the level of the spell being cast.</p><p>At 17th level, the spell warrior gains Parry Spell(APG) as a bonus feat. The skald does not have to meet the prerequisites for this feat.</p><p>This ability replaces spell kenning.</p><p><b>Song of Arcane Manipulation (Su)</b>: At 10th level, a spell warrior can sacrifice his own rage magic to counter an opponent's spell. When using raging song, he can counterspell as an immediate action without interrupting his raging song. However, in addition to expending a spell slot (or spell slots) to attempt to counter the opponent's spell, the skald must expend 1 round of raging song per spell level of the opponent's spell (for example, if attempting to counterspell a 3rd-level spell, the skald must expend one of his own 3rd-level spell slots and 3 rounds of raging song). This ability replaces the dirge of doom raging song.</p><p><b>Spell Tamper (Su)</b>: At 20th level, when a spell warrior successfully counterspells an opponent's spell, the opponent suffers a backlash of magical energy and takes 1d6 points of damage per spell level of the countered spell. If the opponent succeeds at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the skald's class level + the skald's Charisma modifier), the damage is reduced by half. This damage is magical and is not subject to damage reduction or energy resistance. This ability replaces master skald.</p><p><b>Rage Powers</b>: The following rage powers complement the spell warrior archetype: clear mind, disruptive(APG), eater of magic(UC), elemental rage(APG) (lesser, normal, and greater), energy resistance(APG), spell sunder(UC), spellbreaker(APG), sunder enchantment(UC), superstition, and witch hunter(APG).</p><h1>TOTEMIC SKALD (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>The totemic skald forms a close connection to an animal totem. Through the power of this mystical ally, the skald can change shapes, assuming its form as his own. Additionally, the totem animal grants the skald a measure of its spiritual power that he can share with his allies.</p><p><b>Totem (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, the totemic skald chooses one animal from the hunter's animal focus list (see page 27). Once selected, this choice cannot be changed. This animal becomes the skald's personal totem animal and influences his later abilities. He gains the following rage power.</p><p><i>Song of the Beast (Su)</i>: The totemic skald grants the animal focus abilities of his totem animal (as the hunter's animal focus ability) to all allies affected by his raging song. He treats his skald level as his hunter level for determining the abilities of the animal focus (such as the improvements gained at 8th and 15th levels). This ability replaces the rage power gained at 3rd level.</p><p><b>Totem Empathy (Ex and Sp)</b>: At 4th level, the totemic skald can improve the attitude of animals of the same type as his totem. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person. The skald rolls 1d20 and adds his skald level and his Charisma modifier to determine the totem empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p><p>In addition, at 4th level, the totemic skald can cast <i>charm animal</i>once per day as a spell-like ability, using his skald level as his caster level and his Charisma modifier to determine the DC. This effect functions only against animals that are of the same type as his totem animal (subject to GM discretion). At 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter, he can use this spell-like ability one additional time per day.</p><p>This ability replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.</p><p><b>Wild Shape (Su)</b>: At 5th level, a totemic skald gains the ability to turn himself into a Small or Medium version of his totem animal and back again once per day, as the wild shape druid class feature. His effective druid level for this ability is equal to his skald level - 1. He can use this ability twice per day at 11th level and three times per day at 17th level. This ability doesn't allow the skald to assume other forms, such as elementals, plants, or other kinds of animals.</p><p>When in animal form, the skald is treated as able to speak normally for the purpose of using raging song, but not for using other abilities that require speech (such as spellcasting). The skald uses his class level as his effective druid level for the purpose of qualifying for feats that affect wild shape (such as Wild Speech(UM)). This ability replaces spell kenning.</p><p><b>Rage Powers</b>: The following rage powers complement the totemic skald archetype: animal fury, beast totem(APG) (lesser, normal, and greater), knockback, knockdown(APG), low-light vision, primal scent(UC), scent, sprint, and swift foot.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"8Ieo8cS34JUtTh6p"}

Any magus who meets the prerequisites for a magus arcana can select that arcana. Unless specifically noted in a magus arcana's description, a magus cannot select a particular magus arcana more than once.</p><p><b>Arcane Deed (Ex)</b>: When a magus takes this arcana, he can pick any one deed from the swashbuckler's deeds class feature, as long as that deed can be used by a swashbuckler of his magus level. The magus can use that deed by using points from his arcane pool as the panache points required for that deed. Even if he gains a panache pool through another means, the magus is not considered to have at least 1 point in his panache pool for the purpose of deeds selected with arcane deed, and his effective swashbuckler level for determining such a deed's effect is 0. A magus can take this arcana multiple times, each time gaining a new deed. The magus must have flamboyant arcana (see below) to select this arcana.</p><p><b>Flamboyant Arcana (Ex)</b>: A magus gains the derring-do and opportune parry and riposte deeds from the swashbuckler's list of deeds. The magus can spend only points from his arcane pool (not panache points) to use these deeds and any other deeds he gains from arcane deed. He can't use points from his arcane pool to use deeds from other classes or those gained by feats, nor can he regain points in his arcane pool the way a swashbuckler would regain panache points. Effects that add to, reduce the cost of, or otherwise affect panache or grit don't affect the arcane pool of a magus with this arcana.</p><h1>ELDRITCH SCION (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Unlike typical magi, eldritch scions find that their spells and abilities come to them instinctively.</p><p><b>Spells</b>: An eldritch scion casts arcane spells drawn from the magus spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an eldritch scion must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell's level. The DC of a saving throw against an eldritch scion's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the eldritch scion's Charisma modifier. An eldritch scion can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as for a bard of the same level. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score.</p><p>An eldritch scion's selection of spells is limited. He has the same number of spells known as a bard of the same level, and can choose new spells to replace old ones at 5th level and every 3 class levels thereafter, just as a bard does. See the bard (<i>Core Rulebook</i>35) for more information on swapping spells known. This ability replaces the magus's spells class feature.</p><p><b>Bloodline</b>: An eldritch scion gains a bloodrager bloodline. The bloodline is selected at 1st level, and this choice cannot be changed. An eldritch scion's effective bloodrager level for his bloodline abilities is equal to his eldritch scion level. He does not gain any bonus feats, and he gains bonus spells from his bloodline at different levels (see the bonus spell class feature, below). To use any ability that normally functions when he's in a bloodrage, an eldritch scion must spend 1 point from his eldritch pool (see below).</p><p>If an eldritch scion takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be of the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM approval, an eldritch scion can change his previous bloodline to make them conform.</p><p>This ability replaces spell recall.</p><p><b>Eldritch Pool (Su)</b>: An eldritch scion gains an eldritch pool of personal magical energy, equal to 1/2 his magus level (minimum 1) + his Charisma modifier. As a swift action, he can spend 1 point of eldritch energy to enter a state of mystical focus for 2 rounds. This allows him to use abilities from his bloodrager bloodline as though he were in a bloodrage, though he gains none of the other benefits or drawbacks of bloodraging. At 4th level, an eldritch scion can also use his eldritch pool as an arcane pool, gaining all the benefits of the magus's arcane pool class feature.</p><p>Additionally, any magus class feature or spell from the magus spell list that normally uses a calculation based on Intelligence is instead based on Charisma for an eldritch scion. For example, an eldritch scion with the arcane accuracy magus arcana grants himself an insight bonus on attacks equal to his Charisma bonus, not his Intelligence bonus. This benefit has no effect on the eldritch scion's skills or skill points. This ability replaces arcane pool, and abilities that modify arcane pool also modify eldritch pool.</p><p><b>Spell Combat (Ex)</b>: An eldritch scion can use spell combat only while in a state of mystical focus (see eldritch pool, above). At 8th level, an eldritch scion can use spell combat at any time. This ability alters spell combat.</p><p><b>Bonus Spells</b>: At 7th level, an eldritch scion gains the bonus spell from his bloodrager bloodline that is normally gained at 10th level. He gains the next three bonus spells from his bloodline at 9th, 11th, and 13th levels, respectively. This ability replaces knowledge pool.</p><p><b>Improved Spell Combat (Ex)</b>: At 14th level, an eldritch scion gains the improved spell combat class feature. This ability alters improved spell combat.</p><p><b>Greater Spell Combat (Ex)</b>: At 18th level, an eldritch scion gains the greater spell combat class feature. This ability alters greater spell combat.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"8TcQ5u2CZ7Q3ytRu"}
{"name":"Cavalier Archetype","permission":{"default":0,"JgpLZkPryhl1EFab":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_zrrxjaps56","path":"Pathfinder RPG - Advanced Class Guide Reference Library#/CF_SEP/ADVANCED CLASS GUIDE#/CF_SEP/CHAPTER 2: ARCHETYPES AND CLASS OPTIONS","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\"></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>While all cavaliers fight for a cause, those causes are as varied as the fighting styles these warriors employ. The new cavalier order and cavalier archetype presented here are two examples that highlight the diversity of cavalier styles and martial disciplines.</p><h1>CAVALIER ORDER</h1><p>In the deepest wilderness, there are cavaliers who are dedicated to the flora and fauna of unspoiled lands.</p><h1>Order of the Beast</h1><p>A cavalier who belongs to this order serves nature in all its forms. These cavaliers believe that animals make the most loyal companions, and keep close to woodland creatures.</p><p><b>Edicts</b>: An order of the beast cavalier must strive to protect nature-including animals and magical beasts-from the encroachment of civilization and from those that seek to harm it. He can slay hostile animals and magical beasts only when attempts to calm or pacify them fail.</p><p><b>Challenge</b>: Whenever an order of the beast cavalier issues a challenge, his mount gains a +1 circumstance bonus on melee attack rolls against the target of his challenge whenever the cavalier is threatening the target. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 cavalier levels beyond 1st level.</p><p><b>Class Skills</b>: An order of the beast cavalier adds Knowledge (nature) and Survival to his list of class skills. When he uses Survival to follow tracks, he gains a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1).</p><p><b>Order Abilities</b>: An order of the beast cavalier gains the following abilities as he increases in level.</p><p><i>Wild Empathy (Ex)</i>: At 2nd level, the cavalier can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions as the druid ability of the same name. The cavalier uses his level as his effective druid level when using this ability.</p><p><i>Wild Mount Shape (Su)</i>: At 8th level, the cavalier gains the ability to turn his mount into a different Medium or Large animal and back again once per day. His options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions as <i>beast shape II</i>, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per cavalier level, or until the cavalier chooses to change his mount back. Changing the mount's form (to a different animal or back to normal) requires the cavalier to touch his mount as a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal the cavalier is familiar with. The mount does not change in size, but does gain the bonuses (not the penalty) noted in <i>beast shape II</i>for a Large animal.</p><p>The cavalier can use this ability an additional time per day at 10th level and every 4 levels thereafter (to a maximum of four times per day at 18th level).</p><p>At 15th level, the cavalier can use this ability to change his mount into a Medium or Large dragon. When taking this form, the cavalier's wild mount shape now functions as <i>form of the dragon I</i>, except as noted above.</p><p><i>Ferocious Charge (Ex)</i>: At 15th level, the cavalier is the embodiment of nature's fury. When the cavalier charges a creature, he can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize his enemy as a free action. If he succeeds at this check, the target is frightened.</p><h1>CAVALIER ARCHETYPE</h1><p>Cavaliers of any order can take this archetype, though it's not suited for orders that bolster the power of mounted combat.</p><h1>Daring Champion (Archetype)</h1><p>While many cavaliers are the champions of old fighting forms, some younger, more daring cavaliers mix a martial style influenced by the lighter armored and more flamboyant swashbuckler forms with the dedication of cavalier orders.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: Daring champions are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and bucklers. This ability replaces the cavalier's weapon and armor proficiency.</p><p><b>Champion's Finesse (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a daring champion gains the benefits of the Weapon Finesse feat with light or one-handed piercing melee weapons, and he can use Charisma in place of Intelligence for the purpose of combat feat prerequisites. A daring champion also counts as having the Weapon Finesse feat for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites. This ability replaces mount.</p><p><b>Nimble (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, a daring champion gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC when wearing light armor or no armor and carrying no more than a light load. Anything that causes the daring champion to lose his Dexterity bonus to AC also causes him to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of +5 at 19th level). This ability replaces cavalier's charge.</p><p><b>Panache and Deeds (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, a daring champion gains the swashbuckler's panache class feature, along with the following swashbuckler deeds: dodging panache, precise strike, and swashbuckler initiative. This ability replaces expert trainer.</p><p><b>Advanced Deeds (Ex)</b>: At 11th level, a daring champion gains the following swashbuckler deeds: superior feint, targeted strike, subtle blade, and dizzying defense. This ability replaces mighty charge.</p><p><b>Champion's Weapon Mastery (Ex)</b>: At 20th level, when a daring champion threatens a critical hit with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, that critical hit is automatically confirmed. Furthermore, the critical modifier of such weapons increases by 1 (2 becomes 3, for example). This ability replaces supreme charge.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"8deNBLUCXq4rv0LJ"}

The amount of concentration needed to master arcane rites and formulae often leaves wizards little room for creativity or exploration of new forms of magic. But there are exceptions: some wizards break the boundaries between the different disciplines of magic in order to gain further understanding and power. The following are some examples of such innovative wizards.</p><h1>EXPLOITER WIZARD (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Contrary to traditional wizardly study, an exploiter wizard forgoes the tried and true methods of arcane focus and arcane schools for the exploits favored by an arcanist. Some wizards regard this blatant exploitation of arcane magic as somehow \"cheating,\" but most exploiters believe this prejudice is closed-minded and overly traditional.</p><p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su)</b>: At 1st level, the exploiter wizard gains the arcanist's arcane reservoir class feature. The exploiter wizard uses his wizard level as his arcanist level for the purpose of determining how many points he gains in his arcane reservoir points at each level. This ability replaces arcane bond.</p><p><b>Exploiter Exploit</b>: At 1st level and every 4 levels thereafter, the exploiter wizard gains a single arcanist exploit (see page 9). The exploiter wizard uses his wizard level as his arcanist level for determining the effects and DCs of his arcanist exploits. This ability replaces arcane school.</p><h1>SPELL SAGE (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>A spell sage has mastered spells of all types, and is able to increase the effectiveness of his own spells and eventually even cast spells from other classes' spell lists. While most wizards focus on a school, the spell sage looks at the particular aspects of individual spells and is not afraid to modify them with interesting bits of insight to gain a deeper understanding of the formulae.</p><p><b>Focused Spells (Su)</b>: At 1st level, once per day the spell sage's understanding of spells allows him to increase his caster level by 4 for a single spell he casts. He can do this twice per day at 8th level and three times per day at 16th level. This ability replaces arcane bond.</p><p><b>Spell Study (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, the sage's understanding of the spells of bards, clerics, and druids is so great that he can use his own magic in an inefficient, roundabout way to duplicate those classes' spells. Once per day, a spell sage can spontaneously cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or druid spell list as if it were a wizard spell he knew and had prepared. The casting time for this spell is 1 full round per spell level of the desired spell (using the lowest spell level if the spell is on more than one of the spell lists indicated above) and requires expending two prepared spells of that spell level or higher; if the spell's casting time is normally 1 full round or longer, this time is added to the spell sage's casting time. For example, if a spell sage wants to use spell study to cast <i>cure light wounds</i>(cleric spell level 1st), he must spend 2 full rounds casting and expend two prepared wizard spells of 1st level or higher.</p><p>At 6th level and every 5 levels thereafter, a spell sage can use this ability an additional time per day (to a maximum of four times per day at 16th level). This ability replaces arcane school.</p><h1>SPIRIT WHISPERER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Spirit whisperers are a breed apart among wizards, and are often mistaken for witches. While spirit whisperers do gain and store their spells by communing with familiars, the spirits they gain guidance from are somewhat closer to the world and more direct than the powers with which witches typically traffic. These wizards treat such spirits as mentors and friends, conversing with them rather than appeasing them in an effort to gain and use arcane knowledge.</p><p><b>Arcane Bond (Ex)</b>: When a spirit whisperer chooses an arcane bond, he must choose the familiar arcane bond, and the familiar gains the spirit animal ability of his selected spirit (see spirit link, below). The spirit whisperer does not need a spellbook, but instead stores and prepares his spell by communing with the familiar as the witch's familiar class feature (<i>Advanced Player's Guide</i>67). This ability alters arcane bond and replaces spellbooks.</p><p><b>Spirit Link (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a spirit whisperer forms a mystical bond with a spirit. The spirit whisperer picks a spirit from the shaman's list of spirits (see page 37). At 1st level, he gains the spirit ability granted by that spirit. At 8th level, he gains the greater spirit ability granted by that spirit. At 20th level, the spirit whisperer gains the manifestation ability granted by that spirit. He uses his wizard level as his shaman level for determining the effects and the DCs of abilities granted by the spirit. In addition, he uses his Intelligence modifier in place of his Wisdom modifier for these abilities. He does not gain hexes, spirit magic spells, or the true spirit ability typically granted to a shaman by these spirits. This ability replaces arcane school and the bonus feat gained at 20th level.</p><p><b>Spirit Hex</b>: At 5th level, a spirit whisperer can select one hex from among those granted by his chosen spirit. He uses his wizard level as his shaman level when determining the effects and the DC of this hex. In addition, he uses his Intelligence modifier in place of his Wisdom modifier for these hexes. At 10th and 15th level, he can select another hex from those granted by his spirit. Each hex selected in this way replaces the bonus feat gained at that level. This ability alters bonus feats.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"9ytbJLFdzBr3MOuK"}
{"name":"Summoner Archetype","permission":{"default":0,"JgpLZkPryhl1EFab":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_zrrxjaps56","path":"Pathfinder RPG - Advanced Class Guide Reference Library#/CF_SEP/ADVANCED CLASS GUIDE#/CF_SEP/CHAPTER 2: ARCHETYPES AND CLASS OPTIONS","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\"></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>There are those summoners who choose not to summon the traditional eidolon, but rather call upon the other forces to help form their chief allies. Some of these summoners enhance their eidolons with animal traits, while others form a strong bond with a particular shamanistic spirit.</p><h1>NATURALIST (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>A naturalist is a summoner who is in tune with the natural world, using his magic like a lens to focus various animal aspects onto his eidolon. More akin to a hunter than to other arcane spellcasters, a naturalist instinctively masters the power of such creatures as the bear, wolf, mouse, and tiger to make his exotic eidolon the perfect living tool for battle or stealth, and he eventually discovers how to apply these transformations to himself as well.</p><p><b>Nature's Call (Sp)</b>: Starting at 1st level, the naturalist can cast <i>summon nature's ally I</i>as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. He can use this ability only to summon creatures of the animal, magical beast, or vermin type. This ability otherwise functions as the <i>summon monster I</i>class feature (increasing in level as the naturalist goes up in level and with the same restrictions). This ability replaces <i>summon monster I</i>.</p><p><b>Animal Focus (Su)</b>: At 4th level, as a swift action a naturalist can enhance his eidolon with the aspect of an animal. Each time he uses this ability, he can select a hunter's animal aspect (see page 27) and apply it to his eidolon. His hunter level for this ability is equal to his summoner level - 2. He does not gain the ability to apply an animal aspect to himself (see Shared Focus, below). This effect lasts until the eidolon is dismissed or sent back to its home plane.</p><p>When an animal aspect is applied to an eidolon, its form is altered by superficial physical changes appropriate to that aspect. For example, using aspect of the bat might give the eidolon larger ears and eyes and perhaps membranes of skin connecting its limbs to its body, while using aspect of the stag might give the eidolon antlers and hoof like nails on its feat. None of these changes interfere with any of the eidolon's natural or magical abilities.</p><p>This ability replaces shield ally and greater shield ally.</p><p><b>Second Animal Focus (Su)</b>: At 10th level, whenever a naturalist uses animal focus, he can apply two animal aspects to his eidolon. The eidolon's form gains superficial physical changes appropriate to the chosen aspects. This ability replaces the aspect summoner class ability.</p><p><b>Shared Focus (Su)</b>: At 14th level, the naturalist begins to take on some of the feral nature of his eidolon. Whenever the naturalist uses animal focus to apply an aspect to his eidolon, he also gains the effects of the chosen aspect. The naturalist keeps this aspect until his eidolon is dismissed or sent back to its home plane. The naturalist gains the effects of only one aspect (of his choice), even if the eidolon gains more than one. This ability replaces life bond.</p><p><b>Third Animal Focus (Su)</b>: At 18th level, whenever a naturalist uses his animal focus ability, he can apply a third animal aspect to his eidolon. This third aspect persists indefinitely until he decides to change it. This ability replaces greater aspect.</p><h1>SPIRIT SUMMONER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>A spirit summoner is an arcane spellcaster whose eidolon is a manifestation of a shamanic spirit. The bond connecting the summoner and this spirit might be friendly, such as a member of a tribe giving flesh to his protector spirit, or hostile, such as an outlander or a rival compelling service from an unwilling spirit. The summoner can draw upon the divine power of this spirit, but is not constrained by the spirit's morals or ethics.</p><p><b>Spirit (Su)</b>: A spirit summoner forms a mystical bond with one spirit from the shaman class (see page 37). He gains the spirit ability of that spirit and uses his summoner level as his shaman level for determining its effects. The spirit summoner can select spells granted by that spirit as summoner spells known, using the shaman level of the spell as the summoner spell level. The summoner cannot select spirit spells of 7th level or higher.</p><p>At 9th level, the summoner gains the abilities listed in the greater version of his selected spirit.</p><p>At 17th level, the summoner gains the abilities listed for the true version of his selected spirit.</p><p>This ability replaces the <i>summon monster</i>spell-like ability.</p><p><b>Eidolon</b>: At 1st level, a spirit summoner begins play with a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon's form and abilities must be appropriate to his chosen spirit, at the GM's discretion-for example, a summoner with the flame spirit cannot have an eidolon with ice or water abilities, a summoner with a heavens spirit cannot have a fiend-like eidolon, and so on. The summoner can use temporary effects (such as <i>evolution surge(</i>APG)) to alter the eidolon into an inappropriate form, but cannot use permanent effects (such as <i>transmogrify(</i>APG)) to do so. This ability alters the eidolon class feature.</p><p><b>Hex</b>: At 6th level, a spirit summoner can select a shaman hex that is appropriate to his spirit, chosen from the general list of shaman hexes or the specific hexes allowed by his spirit. This ability otherwise functions as a shaman's hex, and uses his summoner level as his shaman level. Like a shaman, a spirit summoner uses his Wisdom modifier to determine hex DCs.</p><p>At 8th, 10th, and 16th levels, the summoner can select another hex.</p><p>This ability replaces aspect, maker's call, merge forms, and transposition.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"9zoGTYObYuLce9z6"}

The methods by which inquisitors accomplish this duty, however, are as diverse as they are themselves-while some protect the innocent, others hunt the guilty.</p><h1>SACRED HUNTSMASTER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Some inquisitors create a strong bond with an animal companion, and the two of them hunt and punish threats to the faith as an awe-inspiring duo. When they work together as one, there are few that dare to stand in their way.</p><p><b>Animal Companion (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a sacred huntsmaster forms a bond with an animal companion. This ability functions as the hunter class feature of the same name, using her inquisitor level as her hunter level. This ability replaces judgment 1/day.</p><p><b>Hunter Tactics (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, a sacred huntsmaster automatically grants her teamwork feats to her animal companion. The companion doesn't need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats. This ability replaces solo tactics.</p><p><b>Animal Focus (Su)</b>: At 4th level, a sacred huntsmaster can take on aspects of an animal as a swift action. This ability functions as the hunter's animal focus class feature, with her inquisitor level serving as her hunter level. This ability replaces later iterations of the judgment ability.</p><p><b>Improved Empathic Link (Su)</b>: At 8th level, the sacred huntsmaster gains an empathic link with her animal companion. This ability functions as an empathic link with a familiar, except the sacred huntsmaster can also see through a companion's eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The sacred huntsmaster is blinded while maintaining this connection. This ability replaces second judgment.</p><p><b>Raise Animal Companion (Sp)</b>: At 16th level, a sacred huntsmaster gains <i>raise animal companion</i>(UM) as a spell-like ability (not restricted to her own animal companion). Using this ability gives the sacred huntsmaster a negative level that cannot be overcome in any way (including by <i>restoration</i>), but that automatically ends after 24 hours. At 16th level, this ability functions as <i>resurrection</i>instead of <i>raise dead</i>, but otherwise operates as normal. This ability replaces third judgment.</p><p><b>Second Animal Focus (Ex)</b>: At 17th level, whenever a sacred huntsmaster uses her animal focus ability, she applies two animal aspects to herself instead of one, and can apply two aspects to her companion instead of one. As with the companion's previous aspect, this second one does not count against the minutes per day a sacred huntsmaster can take on an aspect. If her animal companion is dead and the sacred huntsmaster has applied that aspect to herself, that aspect counts toward her maximum of two aspects at once. The sacred huntsmaster can still apply only one of her dead companion's aspects to herself, not both. This ability replaces slayer.</p><p><b>Greater Empathic Link (Su)</b>: At 20th level, the range of a sacred huntsmaster's empathic link with her animal companion increases to 10 miles. If the animal companion is within 1 mile, it and the sacred huntsmaster can communicate telepathically. This ability replaces true judgment.</p><h1>SANCTIFIED SLAYER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>While all inquisitors root out enemies of the faith, in many orders and churches there's a select group of these religious hunters devoted to one goal, and one goal alone- to terminate the enemies of the faith wherever they can be found. Sometimes these sanctified slayers are given special dispensation to commit ruthless murders for the faith's greater good. Other times, they're simply willing to take the initiative to revel in the zeal of their grisly work.</p><p><b>Studied Target (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a sanctified slayer gains the slayer's studied target class feature. She uses her inquisitor level as her effective slayer level to determine the effects of studied target. This ability replaces judgment 1/day.</p><p><b>Sneak Attack (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, if a sanctified slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot to deal extra damage. The sanctified slayer's attack deals additional damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the sanctified slayer flanks her target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. If a sanctified slayer scores a critical hit with the sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p><p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, a whip, or an unarmed strike), a sanctified slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, even with the usual -4 penalty.</p><p>A sanctified slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A sanctified slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment. This ability replaces the later iterations of the judgment ability.</p><p><b>Talented Slayer (Ex)</b>: At 8th, 16th, 17th, and 20th levels, a sanctified slayer can gain a single slayer talent, including those from the list of rogue talents that a slayer can take, but not an advanced slayer talent. This ability replaces second judgment, third judgment, slayer, and true judgment.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"AiuRrk18o9hxdm9h"}

Some look beyond the bounds of the world that is commonly accepted, while others seek the spirits of nature to aid them in their work. Still others dabble in the mysteries of battle, and refine the ability to augment their skill at arms.</p><h1>PSYCHIC SEARCHER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>A psychic searcher is devoted to revealing the hidden within the world around her by sensing and communing with residual mental energy, haunts, and fragments of living spirits that can dwell in objects or rooms.</p><p><b>Bonus Spells</b>: <i>Augury</i>(4th), <i>locate object</i>(6th), <i>divination</i>(8th), <i>find the path</i>(12th), <i>discern location</i>(16th), <i>foresight</i>(18th). These bonus spells replace the oracle's mystery bonus spells at these levels.</p><p><b>Inspiration (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, a psychic searcher gains an inspiration pool, as the investigator class feature. A psychic searcher uses her oracle level as her investigator level to determine the effects of this ability. She can use inspiration on Diplomacy, Knowledge (arcana, history, local, nobility, planes, or religion), and Sense Motive checks without spending uses of inspiration, provided she's trained in the skill. A psychic searcher's inspiration pool refreshes each day, usually when she refreshes her spells. A psychic searcher's inspiration pool is based on her Charisma modifier, not her Intelligence modifier. This ability replaces the mystery spell gained at 2nd level.</p><p><b>Psychic Talent (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, a psychic searcher's mastery of her supernatural insight grows, granting her a new investigator talent from the following list: amazing inspiration, eidetic recollection, empathy, inspired alertness, item lore, perceptive tracking (except using Sense Motive instead of Perception or Survival), rogue talent (hard to fool(APG) only), and tenacious inspiration. Whenever a psychic searcher can select a new revelation, she can instead select a talent from the above list. This ability replaces the revelation gained at 3rd level.</p><p><b>Recommended Mysteries</b>: Ancestor, lore, nature.</p><h1>SPIRIT GUIDE (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Through her exploration of the universe's mysteries, a spirit guide opens connections to the spirit world and forms bonds with the entities that inhabit it.</p><p><b>Class Skills</b>: A spirit guide gains all Knowledge skills as class skills. This abilities replaces the bonus class skills gained from the oracle's mystery class feature.</p><p><b>Bonded Spirit (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, a spirit guide can form a temporary bond with a spirit, as the shaman's wandering spirit class feature (see page 37). She must make this selection each day when she refreshes her spells. A spirit guide cannot bond with a spirit that is incompatible with her alignment, ethos, or mystery (GM's discretion).</p><p>A spirit guide gains one hex of her choice from the list of hexes available from that spirit. She uses her oracle level as her shaman level, and she switches Wisdom for Charisma and vice versa for the purpose of determining the hex's effects.</p><p>At 4th level, she adds the bonded spirit's spirit magic spells to her oracle spells known for that day, but only those of spell levels she can cast. At 7th level, she gains the spirit ability of her current bonded spirit. At 15th level, she gains the greater spirit ability of her current bonded spirit.</p><p>This ability replaces the revelations gained at 3rd, 7th, and 15th levels.</p><p><b>Recommended Mysteries</b>: Ancestor, heavens, lore.</p><h1>WARSIGHTED (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>A warsighted's unique gifts are not grounded in strange magical revelations, but rather in her ability to adapt in the midst of a battle with new fighting techniques. The warsighted is a master of combat, as dedicated as a fighter and as flexible as a brawler.</p><p><b>Martial Flexibility (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a warsighted can use a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn't possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The warsighted must otherwise meet the feat's prerequisites. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her oracle level. The warsighted can use this ability again before the duration expires in order to replace her previously chosen combat feat with another choice.</p><p>If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (for example, Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat's daily limit. At higher levels, when she gains multiple feats through this ability, she can use those feats to meet the prerequisites of other feats she gains with this ability. Doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another's prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p><p>At 7th level, a warsighted can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She can select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action.</p><p>At 11th level, a warsighted can use this ability to gain the benefits of three combat feats at the same time. She can select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action.</p><p>At 15th level, a warsighted can use this ability to gain the benefit of one combat feat as an immediate action or three combat feats as a swift action.</p><p>This ability replaces the revelations gained at 1st, 7th, 11th, and 15th levels.</p><p><b>Recommended Mysteries</b>: Battle, bones, nature, metal.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"BqpTaLDerFXC5YIU"}

A dare grants the character a benefit and makes it easier to regain either grit or panache.</p><p>A dare can be taken in place of one of the bonus feats a gunslinger or a swashbuckler gains at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter. A gunslinger or a swashbuckler can choose to have multiple dares, but must pick only one to be active each time she reaches 0 grit points or panache points. Once chosen, the active dare cannot be changed until the gunslinger or swashbuckler reaches 0 grit points or panache points again.</p><p>These dares can be used by gunslingers and swashbucklers.</p><p><i>Desperate Evasion (Ex)</i>: While this dare is active, you gain the evasion class feature. If you already have this class feature, while this dare is active you roll twice when making a Reflex saving throw and take the higher result. You regain 1 grit point or panache point when you succeed at two Reflex saving throws while using this dare.</p><p><i>Frantically Nimble (Ex)</i>: While this dare is active, you gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC. You regain 1 grit point or panache point when any enemy making a ranged or melee attack against you misses you three consecutive times. The attacks don't need to come from the same enemy.</p><p><i>Out for Blood (Ex)</i>: While this dare is active, your critical threat range with firearms (for gunslingers) or light or one-handed piercing melee weapons (for swashbucklers) increases by 1 (20/x4 becomes 19-20/x4, 19-20/x2 becomes 18-20/x2, and so on). This effect does not stack with similar effects that modify a weapon's critical threat range.</p><p><i>Run Like Hell (Ex)</i>: While this dare is active, your base speed increases by 10 feet, and you retain your Dexterity bonus to your AC while running. You regain 1 grit or panache point the first time you are more than 100 feet away from your closest enemy.</p><h1>BOLT ACE (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>While most gunslingers are full of sound and fury, a few never soil their hands with powder or smell gun smoke.</p><p><b>Crossbow Maven</b>: A bolt ace is proficient with all crossbows instead of all firearms and begins play with a masterwork crossbow of her choice. This ability alters the gunslinger's weapon proficiencies and replaces gunsmith.</p><p><b>Grit (Ex)</b>: A bolt ace regains grit when she scores a critical hit or deals a killing blow with any kind of crossbow. This ability modifies the grit class feature.</p><p><b>Deeds</b>: A bolt ace can perform the following deeds with a crossbow instead of a firearm: gunslinger initiative, pistol-whip, dead shot, targeting, bleeding wound, death's shot, and stunning shot. The bolt ace gains the following deeds.</p><p><i>Sharp Shoot (Ex)</i>: At 1st level, a bolt ace can resolve an attack against touch AC instead of normal AC when firing a crossbow at a target within its first range increment. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point. This deed's cost cannot be reduced by any ability or effect that reduces the amount of grit points a deed costs (such as Signature Deed). This deed replaces deadeye.</p><p><i>Vigilant Loading (Ex)</i>: At 1st level, as long as a bolt ace has at least 1 grit point, she does not provoke attacks of opportunity when loading a crossbow. This deed replaces quick clear.</p><p><i>Shooter's Resolve (Ex)</i>: At 3rd level, a bolt ace can spend 1 grit point when making a crossbow attack as a standard action and ignore the effects of concealment (though not total concealment) and cover (other than total cover) against that shot. This deed replaces utility shot.</p><p><i>Distracting Shot (Ex)</i>: At 7th level, a bolt ace can spend 1 grit point and choose to miss a target that she could normally attack within her range with a crossbow attack. When she does, the target loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) for 1 round. This deed replaces startling shot.</p><p><i>Vigilant Shooter (Ex)</i>: At 11th level, a bolt ace can spend 1 grit point when firing a crossbow to avoid provoking attacks of opportunity while doing so. This deed replaces expert loading.</p><p><i>Inexplicable Reload (Ex)</i>: At 11th level, loading a crossbow becomes unthinking and automatic for a bolt ace. As long as she has at least 1 grit point, she always starts each round of combat (even a surprise round) with her crossbow loaded. Also, the amount of time needed to reload a crossbow decreases by one step: a standard action becomes a move action, a move action becomes a swift action, a swift action becomes a free action, and a free action becomes not an action. This deed replaces lightning reload.</p><p><i>Pinning Shot (Ex)</i>: At 15th level, the bolt ace can spend 1 grit point while shooting a crossbow and attempt to pin down its target with the bolt. If the crossbow attack hits, it pins the target to a nearby object, to a wall, or to the ground, entangling and staggering the target. While pinned by the bolt, the target cannot move (except by teleportation) until it takes a standard action to free itself from the pinning bolt. This deed replaces menacing shot.</p><p><b>Crossbow Training (Ex)</b>: Starting at 5th level, a bolt ace can select one specific type of crossbow, such as hand crossbow or heavy crossbow. She gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to her Dexterity modifier with that crossbow. Furthermore, when she scores a critical hit with that type of crossbow, her critical modifier increases by 1 (x2 becomes x3, for example).</p><p>Every 4 levels thereafter, she can pick a different type of crossbow, gaining the bonus damage and increased critical multiplier with that type of crossbow as well. This ability replaces gun training.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"CGrteoEayzIVaTgb"}
{"name":"Class Design","permission":{"default":0,"JgpLZkPryhl1EFab":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_mqyqwzciz6","path":"Pathfinder RPG - Advanced Class Guide Reference Library#/CF_SEP/ADVANCED CLASS GUIDE#/CF_SEP/CHAPTER 6: DESIGNING CLASSES","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\"></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>The first step in designing a class is deciding what type of class you want it to be. This decision has two vital components-the class's concept and its rules space- both of which must be relatively novel to prevent the new class from copying one of the existing classes.</p><h1>Concept</h1><p>To start the design process, it is best to determine a concept and decide what the class is all about without directly referencing the rules of the game. Most of the classes in the game draw inspiration from somewhere within the whole of the fantasy genre. When considering the concept for a new class, it is vital to use such sources to inspire and inform it. often this part of the process begins with something as simple as a name and a general idea of what the class is all about.</p><p>For example, let's take a look at the barbarian. The name itself calls to mind a number of historical and fantasy connotations, such as being a fierce warrior and flying into a mindless rage. Compare this with the concept for a ranger. While both are characters who are skilled at martial combat, the ranger is more focused on surviving in the wilderness, tracking down foes, and scouting out unknown areas. When determining the concept for your class, you should look for ways to similarly define its distinctions. If the class you want to design is very close in concept to an existing class, with just a few variations, you might want to investigate creating it as an archetype instead (see Archetype Design on page 247).</p><h1>Rules Space</h1><p>In addition to having a strong concept, each class should also have a place in the rules that it can occupy. While the rules for a class can share some similarities with those of an existing class, each new class should have something that makes it unusual, giving it a means to interact with the game, and the game's world, in a new and interesting way. Look for a way that the class can perform its role without coming in contact with the rules of another class. If the rules are too close, you might end up with a class that invalidates (or is invalidated by) an existing class's mechanics in a way that makes it unappealing to play.</p><p>For example, the rogue class focuses on moving unseen and striking foes in precisely the right spot to make it hurt. While there are certainly other classes that have rules that allow them to sneak about or hit for a lot of damage, the way that the rogue goes about it-via sneak attack-is iconic to that class. You want to avoid creating mechanics to do the same things in slightly different ways. At this early stage, this is easy to prevent as long as you ensure that the overall goal of the rules for your concept differs enough from those of another class. If the class you're designing comes too close to the rules of an existing class, you might be better off creating an archetype instead.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Checking Your Concept</h1><p>Once you've worked out a basic concept and a rules niche for the class, you should compare it to other existing classes in the game. Before you start any of the other significantly more time-consuming portions of class design, it's best to ensure that the class works well with the other classes in the game. There are a number of questions you should ask yourself.</p><list><p><li>Does the class have a novel concept and rules niche?</li><li>Does the class have any obvious synergies with existing classes?</li><li>In a party made up of four players, does the inclusion of this class as one of the players cause the party to have any deficiencies or problems while playing the game?</li></p></list><p>No class is perfect when it comes to these sorts of questions, but they should get you thinking in ways that can guide the class design going forward so it becomes a seamless and useful part of the game.</p><h1>Class Story</h1><p>Once you've got the basics of the concept and the rules worked out, it's time to work on the story that informs your class. This often appears at the beginning of a class description to give a player an idea of what the class is all about without having to decipher charts and read through pages of mechanics. This text is a narrative that summarizes your decisions about what the class can and cannot do. Think of it as a guide to the mechanical decisions you will be making later. If those choices don't fulfill the promise of the story, you should consider revising them (or revising the story if the mechanical components are just too good to pass up).</p><h1>Basic Mechanics</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>When designing the mechanical components of a class, begin with the basics present in all of them. The choices you make for these components will help inform the choices you make when it comes to the components and features that are specific to the class.</p><p>Many of the basic mechanics have varying levels of power and ability. No class should be the best at all or even most of these mechanics. In fact, the more exceptional a class is at the basic mechanics, the less room you have as a designer to include other interesting class features. Compare your choices with those made for the existing classes to get an understanding of this dynamic and determine how you will balance your new class.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Base Attack Bonus</b>: There are three types of base attack bonus progressions in the game. The slow progression (used by sorcerers and wizards) is usually reserved for arcane spellcasters with a full spellcasting progression (i.e. their spells go up to 9th level). The medium progression (used by bards, clerics, druids, monks, and rogues) is used for most characters who have a wide variety of class features and that are expected to be an active part of combat. The fast progression (used by barbarians, fighters, paladins, and rangers) is used for characters who are expected to be in the thick of every fight and who rely very little on spellcasting.</p><p><b>Hit Dice</b>: The type of Hit Die used by each class is almost always determined by its base attack bonus progression. Those on the slow progression get a d6, medium gets a d8, and fast gets a d10. There are a few exceptions to this rule (like the barbarian), but making this exception can be a significant boost to the class and should be considered when designing other class elements.</p><p><b>Saving Throws</b>: There are two types of saving throw progressions used in the game. For ease of reference, we'll call them \"good\" and \"bad.\" Each class has one or two good saving throws, while the rest are bad. There is only one class in the game with all good saving throws (the monk), making it a signature feature of that class and one that should not generally be replicated by others. Which saving throws are good says a lot about the class. Most spellcasters have good Will saves. Most combat-oriented classes have good Fortitude saves. Most classes that focus on mobility and agility have Reflex as one of their good saves.</p><p><b>Skills</b>: When deciding on the skills for your class, there are two things to consider: the number of skill ranks per level and which skills are class skills. In terms of skill points, most classes get only 2 per level (plus the character's Intelligence modifier). A few classes get 4 or even 6, but this is a boost that should be kept in mind when designing other elements of the class. Only the rogue gets 8 per level, and you should have a very good reason for giving a class a similar number (since doing so infringes on the rogue's role as the most skilled class). As for class skills, the number and type can vary wildly from class to class. Most classes have around 10 class skills, but those with more ranks per level have more. The class skills you select say a lot about what members of the class consider important. A class should be good at the skills that it needs to fulfill its role in the game-and nothing more. It might be tempting to give Perception and Stealth to just about every class in the game, but unless you're creating a sneaky class or a class designed to scout, such skills are not necessarily appropriate class skill choices, as it's important to leave holes for other characters in a party to fill. Finally, remember that most classes receive Craft and Profession as class skills unless they're particularly uncivilized (see the barbarian).</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Spellcasting</b>: Not every class possesses the ability to cast spells, but it's a common enough feature to be worth considering with the rest of the basic mechanics. The game uses three basic models for spellcasting, although there are variants on these depending on whether the character is a prepared or spontaneous spellcaster. The minor spellcaster (such as the paladin or the ranger) does not start play with spellcasting capability, has a limited spell list, and gets spells of up to only 4th level. The moderate spellcaster (such as the bard) begins play with some spellcasting, receives spells of up to 6th level, and has a significantly larger spell list. The full spellcaster (such as the cleric, the druid, the sorcerer, and the wizard) gains spells of up to 9th level and has an expansive spell list. A fast BAB progression is perfect for minor spellcasters, whereas moderate and full spellcasters always have a slow or medium BAB progression. Avoid creating a full spellcasting class with a fast BAB progression. You don't have to design the class's spell list when determining the basic mechanics, but you should know what kind of spellcasting ability the class is going to possess (see Designing a Spell List on page 245 for advice on creating a list of spells for your class).</p><h1>Class Features</h1><p>Once you have the basic mechanics sorted out, it's time to start designing class features. These are the mechanics that a class gets as it gains levels, and each feature grants it powers and abilities that make it stand out from the other classes in the game.</p><p>Most class features fall into one of two categories: primary features and secondary features. Primary features are a signature of the class. These abilities advance in power and utility as the class progresses through its levels,and improvements to these features are often one of the things players look forward to most as they play a member of that class. Examples of primary class features include barbarian rage, bardic music, smite evil, and sneak attack. Secondary features are often abilities that are gained once and do not change much over the character's adventuring career, or are otherwise relatively minor. Examples of secondary class features include bravery, pass without trace, and trapfinding. Note that while primary features tend to be isolated to just one class, secondary features might appear in multiple classes.</p><h1>Class Features</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Primary Features</b>: These features are the key to creating a fun and engaging class. They are usually gained at 1st level and improve at higher levels, which keeps these features relevant to characters throughout their adventuring careers. They are almost universally aimed at granting an advantage in combat, giving characters who utilize them interesting ways to engage in those encounters. Rage, for example, grants the barbarian increased power and damage-dealing capability when in use.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>As the barbarian increases in level, the bonuses granted by rage and the number of rounds per day that the ability can be used increase as well. Sneak attack works much the same way, increasing in power as the rogue gains levels so it can continue to compete with foes that possess higher hit point totals.</p><p>When designing a new primary feature, use existing primary features as a guide. Most primary class features increase in power every few levels, usually by some small increment. Those that rely on duration often increase in overall duration with each level gained. The duration should be able to be used in discrete increments, so that a character can utilize the ability more than just once per day (unless the duration is quite long).</p><p>Note that in most cases, a class with a full spellcasting progression does not receive a powerful primary class feature. In such cases, the spellcasting itself plays this role. Those with minor or moderate spellcasting progressions often receive a class feature that is related to their spellcasting. Usually this means that the primary class feature does not need to change much as the character gains levels (see the magus's spell combat class feature). The feature can remain relatively constant because it's the spells themselves that get better as the character gains levels.</p><p><b>Secondary Features</b>: These features are designed to round out a class, giving it abilities that allow it to better fit its role. For the most part, secondary features are situational, granting a bonus or a useful ability in specific scenarios. Bravery, for example, grants a bonus only on Will saves made against fear. The feature also helps a fighter fill out his role as the brave hero facing off against terrifying foes.</p><p>Secondary features don't always improve as the character gains levels. Some simply offer a useful ability that is applicable at any level after it's gained. Woodland stride, for example, is valuable at any level, and since it does not grant a bonus on a skill check or another check, it doesn't need to become more powerful as the character gains levels.</p><p>Unlike primary features, secondary features might show up in more than one class. While a class should have secondary features that relate to its theme, it is acceptable to use a secondary feature from another class instead of inventing a new feature to accomplish the same goal. For example, both the barbarian and the rogue gain uncanny dodge as they gain levels. Since both are known for being quick to react to danger, it makes sense for them both to have that feature instead of both receiving different features that effectively do the same thing.</p><p><b>Dead Levels</b>: As you fill out the primary and secondary features of your class, it's vital to sort them by level so that you can readily see when each is gained and (in the case of primary features) when each increases in power and utility. This allows you to ensure that the class is not too loaded up with class features at any given level. This also allows you to avoid \"dead levels,\" meaning levels in which the character would gain only improvements to the class's base mechanics. As a general rule, you don't want any level to grant more than one or two class features, and you want to avoid dead levels-acquiring new and improved abilities is part of the fun of leveling up!</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Spellcasters are sometimes an exception to this guideline. In the case of a full spellcaster, acquiring a new level of spells to cast is valuable enough to count as a class feature. Take the druid, for example: the class has a few levels in which no class features are gained or improved upon, but almost all of these levels occur when the druid gains a new level of spells to cast. All of a sorcerer's bloodline abilities come at odd-numbered levels, owing to the fact that sorcerers gain new spell levels at every even-numbered level. This principle can be applied to moderate spellcasters too, but as a general guide, minor spellcasters and classes with no spellcasting should receive a class feature, or an improvement to an existing feature, at every level from 1st to 20th.</p><p><b>Capstone</b>: Most classes have a capstone ability-an ability gained at 20th level. In most games, this will be the last ability gained by the character, and it should definitely feel like a reward for achieving such lofty heights of power. Feel free to go a bit over the top on this ability. Let it be something that your players long to have. If they've survived that long, they've certainly earned it.</p><h1>Designing a Spell List</h1><p>Designing a spell list for classes with the ability to cast spells can be a daunting task. You must consider the various sources to use when building your list, while still leaving room for expansion in the future when new spells become available.</p><p>Spell lists must have some form of internal consistency that speaks to the nature of the class. Wizards aren't known for their healing magic, which is why the cure spells aren't on any of their lists. Bards spend much of their time enhancing the abilities of their teammates, which is why many of their spells help one or more characters. When designing a spell list for your class, you should ask yourself, \"What does this class accomplish with its spells?\" This question, above all others, will help you make a spell list that feels right for the class.</p><h1>Designing a Spell List</h1><p>The number of spells on a class's spell list is also an important consideration. Minor spellcasters generally have a smaller number of spells to choose from, but at their higher levels, they gain access to spells that are normally of a higher level for classes with a moderate or full spellcasting progression. Classes with a full spellcasting progression should have a wide variety of spells to choose from, as this tends to be one of the primary ways they contribute to the game.</p><p>Deciding at what level a spellcaster should have access to a spell is one of the most challenging aspects of spell list design. Various spells should appear at different levels, depending on the class. Take <i>hold person</i>as an example: clerics receive the spell at 2nd level, whereas for sorcerers and wizards the spell is 3rd level. The vital thing to note here is that some spells (and others that grant a similar ability) should not be available until the PCs are of a certain minimum level. For example, the game generally assumes that the PCs cannot reliably fly until they're 5th level, and that they cannot raise the dead or teleport until they're 9th. There are some exceptions to these guidelines, but they are rare and should be considered very carefully, since adventures are written with these benchmarks in mind. Also, keep in mind that any spell you define as 4th level or lower can then be put into a wand, while spells of 3rd level or lower can be made into potions. When in doubt, look to the cleric and sorcerer/wizard spell lists for guidance.</p><h1>Review and Polish</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Once you've decided on the basic mechanics and designed all of the class features, it's time to take a step back and look at your creation. Ideally, review should be part of your process as the design takes shape, but it's an even more vital step once all of the pieces are in place.</p><p>When you're reviewing your work, the first step is to imagine a character as it advances through the levels in the class. Are there any levels that are particularly lackluster or overburdened with options? Does the class have levels to really look forward to? Can the class meaningfully contribute to the game at every level of play? Compare your class to others, looking at it on a level-by-level basis to weigh the power and versatility of the class.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>If it is better than most at a given level, you might need to scale back some of its class features. Likewise, if it's too weak at a level, you might need to enhance a class feature, or even add a new one.</p><h1>Review and Polish</h1><p>Once you're satisfied with the class, it's time to polish the mechanics to ensure that they're clear and concise. Let a friend or a fellow player look at the rules as written. That person will undoubtedly have a few questions about how things work or how the rules interact with other existing rules elements. These questions can help you refine the language to make a class that is easy to understand and fun to play.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Finally, it's time to playtest the class. Build a number of characters using the class rules and run them in mock combat against other characters and monsters. If you're playtesting with only one character versus one opponent, understand that against a foe of equal level, the fight should be close to evenly matched, depending on the environment and setup. When playtesting against monsters, pit your creation against a monster with a CR roughly 4 lower than the character's level to get an idea of how the character can handle itself in a fight. Playtesting will you give a sense of whether your mechanics play out as intended-though be wary of taking results from fights with extremely lopsided dice rolls, as these can seriously skew your results.</p><p>The process of designing a class can go through all of these steps a number of times. Don't get discouraged if your first attempts need a lot of work. Design, playtest, and redesign your class concept until you're happy with its final form. Remember, creating a new class is one of the most challenging parts of game design.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter6designingclasses\">^Designing Classes</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_appendix\">Appendix</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"DbygnZ4RSpauL1fd"}

Within that basic concept, however, exists the potential for innumerable interpretations and refinements, ways for the rules to cater to a more specialized interpretation of the class. A member of the swashbuckler class, for example, could be a daring infiltrator, a queen's musketeer, or a masked avenger. Such choices are refined through background details, class options, feats, and skills, all to better forge the character the player imagines and make her more effective at manifesting her unique personality and pursuing her goals.</p><p>Some character concepts are too close to existing classes to warrant being full classes of their own, yet prove compelling enough that they come up in play time and time again. For these situations, the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game has archetypes-sets of modified abilities that can be easily swapped out for those of a given class to help customize its focus. The following pages detail new rules options and alternate class features to help you create iconic fantasy characters.</p><p>This chapter presents new archetypes or other options for all the classes in the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>, <i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide</i>, <i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic</i>, and <i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat</i>, as well as all of the new classes introduced in this book. While most sections in this chapter focus on archetypes, a few focus on other new class options, or present a combination of the two. Many of the archetypes and options in this section allow members of classes from previous books to gain class features of the new classes presented in this book.</p><h1>SELECTING ARCHETYPES</h1><p>The primary way that archetypes (introduced in Chapter 2 of the <i>Advanced Player's Guide</i>) modify base classes is by replacing class features. When a player selects a class for his character, he could choose to use the standard class features found in the class's original description, but he could instead choose to adopt an archetype. Each alternate class feature presented in an archetype replaces or alters a specific class feature from its base class. For example, the strangler archetype's neckbreaker class feature replaces the awesome blow and improved awesome blow features of the standard brawler class. Class features that are not specifically replaced function as described in the original version of the class.</p><p>When an archetype includes multiple alternate class features, a character must take all of them-often blocking the character from ever gaining certain standard class features, but replacing them with other options. All other class features of the base class that aren't mentioned among the alternate class features remain unchanged and are acquired normally when a character reaches the appropriate level, unless otherwise noted. A character with an alternate class feature due to an archetype doesn't count as having the class feature that was replaced for the purpose of meeting any requirements or prerequisites.</p><p>On the other hand, any alternate class feature described as altering an existing class feature otherwise functions as that original class feature, and is considered to be that class feature for the purpose of meeting any requirements or prerequisites, even if that feature is renamed to fit a new theme. For example, a class feature that alters the bard's bardic performance still counts as bardic performance for any prerequisite that requires that ability.</p><p>A character can take more than one archetype and garner additional alternate class features, but none of the alternate class features can replace or alter the same class feature from the base class as the other alternate feature. For example, a warpriest could not be both a champion of fate and a disenchanter, because both archetypes replace the channel energy class feature with something else.</p><p>If an archetype replaces a class feature that's part of a series of improvements or additions to the base class's ability (such as a fighter's weapon training or a ranger's favored enemy), the next time the character would gain that ability, it counts as the lower-level ability that was replaced by the archetype. In effect, all abilities in that series are delayed until the next time the class improves that ability. For example, if an archetype replaces a rogue's +2d6 sneak attack bonus at 3rd level, her sneak attack doesn't jump from +1d6 to +3d6 at 5th level-it improves to +2d6 just as if she had finally gained the increase for 3rd level. This adjustment continues at every level at which her sneak attack would improve, until at 19th level she has +9d6 instead of the +10d6 of a standard rogue.</p><p>If an archetype replaces a class feature that has a series of improvements, but it does not mention one individual improvement, that class feature replaces the entire class feature and all of its improvements. For example, if a class feature says that it replaces trap sense without mentioning a specific bonus, it replaces all the benefits of trap sense.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"G9qmH7Zq3TVLw8YE"}

If light strikes the ink after it has dried, chemicals cause it to spontaneously combust within 1 minute. The combustion is small-not significant enough to ignite anything but paper. Ink used on other materials such as stone or wood simply vanishes, leaving no trace of the writing. A vial of this ink holds enough to write 10 brief messages of no more than 50 words each.</p><h1>LIQUID TRACTION</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 25 GP; <b>WEIGHT</b> 1 lb.</p><p>This glass bottle is filled with sticky goo prized by sailors for the additional traction it grants on ship decks. When applied to the soles of footwear and allowed to dry for 1 hour, liquid traction grants a +2 alchemical bonus on Acrobatics checks to keep your balance and a +2 bonus to CMD against bull rush. Liquid traction has no effect when it comes into contact with very slick or unnaturally slick surfaces such as ice or <i>grease</i>.</p><h1>LOZENGE OF THE SONGBIRD</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 50 GP; <b>WEIGHT</b> -</p><p>This honey-coated candy is made of soothing reagents. If eaten, it takes 1 round to begin working, then grants a +2 alchemical bonus on Perform (sing) checks for 1 hour.</p><h1>MASKING SCENT</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> varies; <b>WEIGHT</b> -</p><table><tr><td colspan=\"8\">Animal</td><td colspan=\"4\"><b>PRICE</b> 25 GP</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"8\">Humanoid</td><td colspan=\"4\"><b>PRICE</b> 50 GP</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"8\">Magical beast</td><td colspan=\"4\"><b>PRICE</b> 100 GP</td></tr></table><p>This item comes in a variety of scents (matching any one animal, humanoid, or magical beast). One vial applied to a single Medium creature changes its scent to that of the masking scent's creature for 8 hours.</p><h1>OIL OF THE MASTERS</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 50 GP; <b>WEIGHT</b> 1/2 lb.</p><p>This gold-tinted oil smells of wood shavings. When you apply it to the strings of a string instrument or the body of a wooden instrument, it improves the quality of the instrument's sound. For 1 hour, anyone playing the instrument gains a +2 alchemical bonus on the appropriate Perform check.</p><h1>PATHSTONES</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>PRICE</b> 50 GP; <b>WEIGHT</b> 1 lb.</p><p>These small white pebbles are alchemically treated so that they shed a soft light once activated by striking them together. The glow is faint-just barely enough to illuminate the stone. Though not bright enough to serve as an effective light source, they can be placed in patterns to create messages or laid out in a path, marking it for others to follow.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>REAGENT PAPER</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>PRICE</b> 1 GP; <b>WEIGHT</b> -</p><p>This slip of paper can aid in the identifying of liquids. Its color changes in accordance with traits such as acidity, salinity, and magic. Expending one sheet confers a +2 alchemical bonus on any Craft (alchemy) or Spellcraft check to identify potions or other liquids.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>TRACKER'S SNUFF</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>PRICE</b> 200 GP; <b>WEIGHT</b> -</p><p>When inhaled, this finely ground, alchemically treated tobacco greatly enhances your senses, especially your sense of smell. It grants the scent ability and a +2 alchemical bonus on Perception checks for 1 hour. Once the effect wears off, your body is wracked with terrible pain as your joints begin to stiffen and seize, and you take 1d2 points of Dexterity damage.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>TRACKING POWDER</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 30 GP; <b>WEIGHT</b> -</p><p>When you scatter this very fine pale blue powder on the ground, it reveals the tracks of any creatures or individuals that have passed through the area within the last 48 hours. The powder also grants you a +10 alchemical bonus on Survival checks to follow tracks or, if you aren't trained in Survival, instead allows you to track creatures whose prints are revealed by the powder for up to 1 mile using Perception instead of Survival. A single application can cover an area of up to 60 square feet. Tracking powder is sold in small leather pouches that hold 10 applications each.</p><h1>VOMIT CAPSULE</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 12 GP; <b>WEIGHT</b> -</p><p>These small capsules consist of a concentrated mix of nausea-inducing herbs. To use a capsule, you bite down and ingest its contents, which almost immediately cause you to projectile vomit. The vomiting lasts 1 full round, during which time you can take no other actions. The following round you recover fully, and suffer no other ill effects. These capsules are most often used by rogues working in teams to create distractions and spectacles in order to draw people's attention away from their activities, as well as by those interested in faking illness, such as pugilists trying to throw fights or criminals seeking to create chaos during an arrest.</p><h1>WOAD PAINTING KIT</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>PRICE</b> 300 GP; <b>WEIGHT</b> 1 lb.</p><p>When preparing a spell, you can grind the spell's material components and mix them into this paste to paint the components directly onto your flesh, allowing you to cast that spell as if you had applied Eschew Materials. Additionally, by painting complex woad designs that symbolize gestures for 10 minutes and succeeding at a Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 15 + the spell level, you can also cast the spell as if you had applied Still Spell. You can have only one spell painted on you in this way at a time, and if you cast the prepared spell or the paint is removed for any reason, the effects of the woad paint are spent.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Woad paint is sold in small, concentrated blocks (costing 60 gp each) that must be ground into paste on a wooden or stone pallet with a small amount of water and material spell components. A typical kit contains a pallet and 5 blocks of paint. One block produces enough paint for 10 component designs or one stilled spell design. Woad paint has no benefit for a non-spellcaster.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter5gearandmagicitems\">^ Gear and Magic Items</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter6designingclasses\">Designing Classes</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"Hfn8sbwc1jYX2ust"}
{"name":"Investigator Archetype","permission":{"default":0,"JgpLZkPryhl1EFab":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_zrrxjaps56","path":"Pathfinder RPG - Advanced Class Guide Reference Library#/CF_SEP/ADVANCED CLASS GUIDE#/CF_SEP/CHAPTER 2: ARCHETYPES AND CLASS OPTIONS","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\"></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Investigators trust in knowledge above all things. often this is not solely the bookish knowledge and abstract formulae of arcane artists, nor the religious knowledge of clerics, nor even the martial knowledge of the soldier, but rather some parts of each of these. Sometimes this knowledge is esoteric, but often it's practical in nature. Investigators master knowledge that allows them to ferret out the secrets that lie behind the hidden code of evidence and speak the ironclad language of cause and effect. They use their knowledge to find those things hidden from others, whether by the passage of time, the rituals of occult orders, or guilty creatures seeking to obscure their trails.</p><p>While most investigators use a mix of empirical science and alchemy to achieve these goals, there are other types of investigators as well. Some rely on different skills and information-such as the whispers of the dead, intuition, and luck-to uncover that which is hidden. The following is just a small sample of the myriad kinds of investigators.</p><h1>EMPIRICIST (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Champions of deductive reasoning and logical insight, empiricists put their faith in facts, data, confirmed observations, and consistently repeatable experiments- these things are their currency of truth.</p><p><b>Ceaseless Observation (Ex)</b>: An empiricist's ability to notice the minutiae of almost everything that happens around him allows him to make shrewd and insightful calculations about people and even inanimate objects. At 2nd level, an empiricist uses his Intelligence modifier instead of the skill's normal key ability for all Disable Device, Perception, Sense Motive, and Use Magic Device checks. He can also use his Intelligence modifier instead of Charisma on any Diplomacy checks made to gather information. This ability replaces poison lore and poison resistance.</p><p><b>Unfailing Logic (Ex)</b>: An empiricist's grasp of facts and data enables him to anchor himself in reality, granting resistance to even the most potent illusions. At 4th level, an empiricist gains a +2 insight bonus on all Will saving throws against illusion spells or spell-like abilities that allow a save to disbelieve their effects. In addition, he can expend one use of inspiration as an immediate action to use his Intelligence bonus instead of his Wisdom bonus on all such saves for 1 round.</p><p>At 8th level, the empiricist's insight bonus increases to +4. At 16th level, he gains immunity to all illusion spells and spell-like abilities that allow a save to disbelieve their effects. This ability replaces swift alchemy.</p><p><b>Master Intellect (Ex)</b>: An empiricist's powers of reason and deduction ultimately become almost superhuman, and he is able to use them in nearly all aspects of life. At 20th level, an empiricist can use inspiration on all skill checks (even for skills he is not trained in) and all ability checks (including initiative checks) without spending uses of inspiration. This ability replaces true inspiration.</p><h1>INFILTRATOR (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>An infiltrator specializes in investigating or disrupting groups from within. He uses his specialized set of skills and alchemical abilities to take the shape of the people or creatures whose company he's infiltrating, or even of specific individuals.</p><p><b>Master of Disguise (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, an infiltrator can use disguise with great results. When disguising himself as a different gender, race, age category, or size category, an infiltrator lessens the penalties for each by 2. For example, if the infiltrator disguises himself as a female two age categories older than himself, he would take a -2 penalty on the check instead of a -6 penalty. Also, an infiltrator can disguise himself with 1d3 minutes of work (instead of 1d3 x 10 minutes of work). This ability replaces trapfinding.</p><p><b>Voice Mimicry (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, an infiltrator learns to mimic voices and sounds around him. Using this ability requires a special Disguise check, and creatures hearing the voice can make a Perception check to discover the ruse. An infiltrator can attempt to emulate any creature's voice or other sound he's heard clearly for at least 1 minute. The bonuses or penalties to this special Disguise check are modified in the following ways, all of which are cumulative.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Disguised Voice Check Modifier</h1><table><tr><td colspan=\"12\">Voice is not your own, but is not that of a distinct individual</td><td colspan=\"2\">+5</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"12\">Voice is that of a different gender</td><td colspan=\"2\">-2</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"12\">Voice is that of a different race</td><td colspan=\"2\">-2</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"12\">Voice is that of a different age category</td><td colspan=\"2\">-2</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"12\">Voice is that of a different size category</td><td colspan=\"2\">-5</td></tr></table></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Also, the creature making the Perception check gains a bonus based on its familiarity with specific voices, just as if it were confronted with a normal disguise (<i>Core Rulebook</i>95). This ability is a language-dependent effect, meaning that if a creature cannot hear or understand what the infiltrator is saying, the ruse fails. Magic items, feats, and traits that affect disguises do not affect this special Disguise check.</p><p>At 8th level, the infiltrator gains the effects of his master of disguise class feature on this special use of the Disguise skill (no penalty for a voice of a different gender, race, or age category, and only a -3 penalty for a different size category). This ability replaces poison lore.</p><p><b>Mimic Mastery (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, when an infiltrator uses <i>disguise self</i>or any polymorph extracts on himself, he is treated as 2 investigator levels higher for the purpose of determining the duration of that extract's effect. He can use these extracts to take the appearance of specific individuals of the form he chooses, gaining a +10 bonus on Disguise checks even if that extract does not normally grant such a bonus. Furthermore, these extracts grant the infiltrator a +10 bonus on Disguise checks that are made as part of his voice mimicry ability. This ability replaces poison resistance.</p><h1>MASTERMIND (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Although many investigators use their honed senses and cunning insight for personal gain, no one excels at such endeavors like the mastermind. Typically, these investigators dwell at the centers of complex networks of lies, minions, or precious information, from which they dispense commands, threats, and rumors, all carefully crafted to increase the power of their peculiar empires. While masterminds often act as the heads organizations such as criminal families, thieves' guilds, or corruption-riddled bureaucracies, they aren't always evil.</p><p><b>Mastermind's Inspiration (Ex)</b>: A mastermind can use inspiration on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks without expending uses of inspiration, but can't do so on Linguistics or Spellcraft checks. This ability alters inspiration.</p><p><b>A Quiet Word (Ex)</b>: A mastermind's reputation precedes him. At 1st level, once per day a mastermind can spend 10 minutes preparing an ally to make a single Diplomacy or Intimidate check (mastermind's choice when preparing the ally) within the next 24-hour period at the mastermind's behest. This skill check uses the mastermind's skill ranks instead of the ally's. The mastermind's affected ally still uses its own ability bonus for the check.</p><p>Furthermore, when a mastermind uses this ability, he can expend one use of inspiration to give the ally use of his inspiration die when making the check.</p><p>At 3rd level, a mastermind can use this ability an additional time each day, and the number of times he can use this ability per day increases by 1 at every third level thereafter. Multiple uses of this ability on the same ally grant that ally the benefit on additional Diplomacy or Intimidate checks.</p><p>At 12th level, a mastermind can use this ability to bestow on his ally the use of his skill ranks, similar to the 1st-level effect of this ability but with a wider range of skills to choose from. The mastermind can bestow this benefit only on a skill check that he can use inspiration on without expending uses of inspiration. For instance, a mastermind with the underworld inspiration talent can bolster his ally's Bluff, Disable Device, Disguise, or Sleight of Hand checks, selecting a particular skill for each use of the ability. This ability replaces trapfinding and trap sense.</p><p><b>Mastermind Defense (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, a mastermind can, as an immediate action, expend two uses of inspiration to make an inspired defense. He rolls his inspiration die and applies the result as a penalty on an attack roll made against him. If the mastermind has the combat inspiration talent, he can expend one use of inspiration on this ability instead of two. This ability replaces swift alchemy.</p><p><b>Impregnable Mind (Su)</b>: At 9th level, a mastermind's secrecy, obscurity, and mental conditioning reach superhuman levels. He becomes immune to any divination spell, spell-like ability, or effect that allows a saving throw (though he can still allow a divination effect to affect him if he wishes). Even divination effects that do not allow a saving throw have difficulty piercing a mastermind's barriers, since a mastermind can now choose to think in any language he speaks. Unless the opponent reading a mastermind's thoughts speaks all of the mastermind's languages, attempts at thought reading automatically fail. This ability replaces the investigator talent gained at 9th level.</p><h1>SLEUTH (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>A sleuth is an investigator who relies on good fortune and guile rather than alchemy. Having no intrinsic mystical energy, she must forgo the more magical aspects of alchemy to solve her mysteries with wits, gumption, and the fickle consideration of luck.</p><p><b>Sleuth's Luck (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a sleuth gains a pool of luck, measuring her ability to get out of scrapes. At the start of each day, a sleuth has a number of luck points equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Her luck goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Charisma modifier (minimum 1), though feats, magic items, and spells that grant either grit points or panache points can also grant a sleuth an equal number of luck points. A sleuth spends luck to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains luck in the following ways.</p><p><i>Rolling a Natural 20 on a Knowledge or Sense Motive Check</i>: While on an investigation, a sleuth regains luck by uncovering secrets. Rolling a natural 20 on these skill checks while actively investigating causes the sleuth to regain 1 luck point. Such skill checks made for more mundane reasons (such as normal research or using Sense Motive to gain information during normal bargaining or while gambling) do not cause the sleuth to regain luck. Determining which skill checks qualify is up to the GM.</p><p><i>Rolling a 6 or Higher on an Inspiration Die</i>: When a sleuth rolls an inspiration die while on an investigation and the result is 6 or higher, she regains 1 luck point. (if she rolls multiple inspiration dice at a time, she regains 1 luck point if the total is 6 or higher.) Like regaining luck via a natural 20 on a qualifying skill check, uses of inspiration for more mundane reasons don't qualify for regaining luck. The GM is the final arbitrator for what rolls qualify. It's possible for an investigator to regain 2 luck points on the same skill check if the qualifying skill check is a natural 20 and any inspiration die roll made results in a 6 or higher.</p><p>This ability and the 1st-level deeds described below replace alchemy. A sleuth cannot take the alchemist discovery talent or any investigator talent that affects alchemy.</p><p><b>Deeds</b>: Sleuths spend luck points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant a sleuth some momentary bonus or effect, but some provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as a sleuth has at least 1 luck point.</p><p>At 1st level, a sleuth gains the following deeds.</p><p><i>Daring (Ex):</i>A sleuth can spend 1 luck point when he makes an Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Fly, Ride, or Swim check to roll d6 and add the result to the check. He can choose to add this die after he attempts the check, but must to do before the result is revealed. If the d6 roll is a natural 6, he rolls another d6 and adds it to the result. He can continue to do this as long as he rolls natural 6s, up to a number of times equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1).</p><p><i>Opportunistic Evasion (Ex)</i>: When a sleuth succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an effect that still deals damage on a successful save, he can spend 1 luck point as an immediate action to instead take no damage from that effect.</p><p><i>Sleuth's Initiative (Ex)</i>: As long as the sleuth has at least 1 luck point, he gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. Furthermore, if he has the Quick Draw feat, his hands are free and unrestrained, and the weapon is not hidden, then he can draw a single light or one-handed melee weapon as part of the initiative check. (Unlike with swashbuckler deeds, this does not have to be a piercing weapon.)</p><p>At 4th level, a sleuth gains the following deeds. These abilities replace swift alchemy.</p><p><i>Make It Count (Ex)</i>: When a sleuth uses studied strike, he can spend 1 luck point to apply an investigator talent that he doesn't already know and that affects studied strike to his studied strike. He must be able to meet that talent's prerequisites.</p><p><i>Run Like Hell (Ex)</i>: A sleuth can spend 1 luck point to gain a +20-foot bonus to his base speed for 1 minute. Furthermore, while under the effect of this bonus, if he moves more than his normal speed in a round, he gains a +4 bonus to AC until the start of his next turn.</p><p><i>Second Chance (Ex)</i>: When a sleuth rolls an inspiration die or uses the daring deed (see above), he can spend 1 luck point to reroll either the inspiration die or the daring deed die. If he rolls a 6 or higher on this reroll, he does not regain a luck point, and he must keep the result of the reroll, even if it is lower.</p><p><b>Investigator Talents</b>: The following investigator talents complement the sleuth archetype: amazing inspiration, combat inspiration, device talent, effortless aid, expanded inspiration, hidden agendas, inspirational expertise, inspired alertness, inspired intimidator, perceptive tracking, quick study, rogue talent, tenacious inspiration, and underworld inspiration.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Grit, Luck, and Panache</h1><p>Grit, luck, and panache represent three different means by which heroes can gain access to the same heroic pool, using it to accomplish fantastic feats. For characters with a mix of grit, luck, and panache, they pool the three resources together into a combined pool. (Those who use panache and luck do not gain twice their Charisma bonuses in their pools.) For feats, magic items, and other effects, a panache user can spend and gain luck points in place of grit points or panache points, and vice versa.</p><p>A luck user does not count as a grit or panache user for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>SPIRITUALIST (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>While most investigators look to the physical world to gain their knowledge, there are those who seek out knowledge beyond the pale. Those who think that the dead tell no tales are quickly proven wrong by the spiritualist. Instead of toying with chemicals and reagents to find clues, he talks directly to the spirit world to uncover the ways and means of skulduggery and the desperate acts committed in the heat of dark passions.</p><p><b>Commune with Spirits (Sp)</b>: Instead of relying on alchemical research to find clues, a spiritualist relies on communion with the world beyond death. At 1st level, a spiritualist gains the ability to use <i>comprehend languages</i>, <i>detect secret doors</i>, and <i>identify</i>, but each has a casting time of 1 minute because the spiritualist needs to consult with the spirits of the dead that dwell in his area or that are attached to him in some way. The spiritualist can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his investigator level + his Wisdom modifier.</p><p>As he advances in level, the spiritualist gains the ability to use other spells, with the casting time as above. At 5th level, he can use <i>augury</i>. At 7th level, he can use <i>speak with dead</i>and <i>locate object</i>. At 9th level, he can use <i>legend lore</i>.</p><p>This ability replaces alchemy. A spiritualist cannot take the alchemist discovery talent or any investigator talent that affects alchemy.</p><p><b>Spirit Sense (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, when a spiritualist attempts a saving throw against an ability or an effect delivered by an incorporeal creature, he can expend one use of inspiration instead of two to augment that saving throw. If the spiritualist has the combat inspiration investigator talent, he need not spend any inspiration to augment such saving throws. This ability replaces poison lore.</p><p><b>Strong Life (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, the spiritualist's dealings with the other side and knowledge of what lies beyond strengthen his will. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against death effects and negative energy damage. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level and to +6 at 8th level. This ability replaces poison resistance.</p><h1>SPIRITUALIST (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Sixth Sense (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, a spiritualist can spend one use of the commune with spirits ability to reroll a single saving throw that he has failed. He must take the result of the reroll, even if it is lower. This ability replaces trap sense.</p><p><b>Whispering Spirits (Su)</b>: At 4th level, the spiritualist can open a conduit with the spirit world that can aid him in combat for a short time. He can expend one use of his commune with spirits ability in order to gain an insight bonus to both AC and saving throws equal to his Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) for 1 minute. This ability replaces swift alchemy.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Touched by the Beyond (Su)</b>: At 11th level, the spiritualist's ability to touch the beyond grants him further protection against the dangers of death and negative energy. The spiritualist becomes immune to death effects, and he takes half damage from negative energy. This ability replaces poison immunity.</p><p><b>Investigator Talents</b>: The following investigator talents complement the spiritualist archetype: amazing inspiration, combat inspiration, effortless aid, eidetic recollection, empathy, expanded inspiration, hidden agendas, inspirational expertise, item lore, studied defense, and tenacious inspiration.</p><h1>STEEL HOUND (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Black powder and firearms are a natural extension of the alchemical experimentation that investigators use on a regular basis. Steel hounds are investigators who have taken to using firearms in place of the more mundane weapons their counterparts favor.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: Steel hounds are proficient with simple weapons, plus the rapier, the sap, and one type of firearm selected at 1st level. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields. This ability replaces the investigator's weapon and armor proficiency.</p><p><b>Packing Heat (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, the steel hound gains both the Amateur Gunslinger and Gunsmithing feats as bonus feats. He also gains a battered gun identical to the one gained by the gunslinger. This ability replaces poison lore.</p><p><b>Investigator Talents</b>: Whenever he gains a new investigator talent, the steel hound can instead select one of the following feats: Extra Grit or Rapid Reload.</p><p><b>Deed (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, a steel hound gains the following deed. This deed works and interacts with grit the same way that gunslinger deeds do, but only the steel hound can use it. If the steel hound also has levels in gunslinger, he can spend grit points from that class to use this deed.</p><p><i>Blind Shot (Su)</i>: A steel hound can spend 1 grit point to ignore all miss chances due to concealment when making firearm attacks. This effect lasts until the end of his turn. This ability allows the steel hound to ignore concealment, but does not reveal the enemy or allow him to see the enemy. This ability replaces swift alchemy.</p><p><b>Talented Shot (Ex)</b>: At 11th level, a steel hound can select a gunslinger deed in place of an investigator talent. For this purpose, his effective gunslinger level is equal to his investigator level - 4.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"I1YkG8HxrihF8ngK"}

<text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>CLASS FEATURES</h1><p>The following are the class features of the skald.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: A skald is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A skald can cast skald spells while wearing light or medium armor and even while using a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a skald wearing heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p><p><b>Bardic Knowledge (Ex)</b>: A skald adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge checks, and can attempt all Knowledge checks untrained.</p><p><b>Cantrips</b>: Skalds learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-11: Skald Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p><p><b>Spells</b>: A skald casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list (see pages 224-226 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>). He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every skald spell has a verbal component-these verbal components can take the form of song, recitation, or even nonverbal music like percussion. To learn or cast a spell, a skald must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell's level. The saving throw DC against a skald's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the skald's Charisma modifier.</p><p>Like other spellcasters, a skald can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-10. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 on page 17 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>).</p><p>The skald's selection of spells is limited. A skald begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the skald's choice. At each new skald level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-11. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a skald knows isn't affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1-11 are fixed.</p><p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the skald loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level skald spell the skald can cast. A skald may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p><p>A skald need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.</p><p><b>Raging Song (Su)</b>: A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level beyond 1st, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.</p><p>Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard's bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces (<i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic</i>21).</p><p>A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect on them. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit.</p><p>When the skald begins a raging song and then on each ally's turn, if the ally can hear the raging song, that ally must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song's effects on that ally last for that ally's turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.</p><p>At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.</p><p><i>Inspired Rage (Su)</i>: At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but also take a -1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of inspired rage, allies other than the skald cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the song's bonuses on Will saves increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn't change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song's bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. (Unlike with the barbarian's rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)</p><p>If an ally has her own rage class ability (such as barbarian's rage, bloodrager's bloodrage, or skald's inspired rage), she may use the Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throw bonuses, as well as AC penalties, based on her own ability and level instead of those from the skald (still suffering no fatigue afterward). Inspired rage does not allow an ally to activate abilities dependent on other rage class abilities, such as rage powers, blood casting, or bloodrager bloodlines; the ally must activate her own rage class ability in order to use these features.</p><p><i>Song of Marching (Su)</i>: At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue. By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle (<i>Core Rulebook</i>170) for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue. The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour.</p><p><i>Song of Strength (Su)</i>: At 6th level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to superhuman feats of strength. Once each round while the skald uses this performance, allies within 60 feet who can hear the skald may add 1/2 the skald's level to a Strength check or a Strength-based skill check.</p><p><i>Dirge of Doom (Su)</i>: At 10th level, a skald can create a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become shaken. This ability affects only enemies that are within 30 feet and able to hear the skald's performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the skald continues his performance. It cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the creature is already shaken from another effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect that relies on audible components.</p><p><i>Song of the Fallen (Su)</i>: At 14th level, a skald can temporarily revive dead allies so they can continue fighting, with the same limitations as <i>raise dead</i>. The skald selects a dead ally within 60 feet and expends 1 round of raging song to bring that ally back to life. The revived ally is alive but staggered. Each round, the skald can expend another 1 round of raging song to keep that ally alive for another round. The ally automatically dies if the skald ends this performance or is interrupted. The skald can revive multiple allies with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must expend 1 round of raging song per revived ally per round to maintain the effect.</p><p><b>Scribe Scroll</b>: At 1st level, a skald gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.</p><p><b>Versatile Performance (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, a skald can choose one category of Perform skill associated with the skald class (see below). He can use his modifier for that skill in place of his modifier for the associated skills listed below. When substituting in this way, the skald uses his total Perform skill modifier in place of the associated skill's modifier, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 7th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the skald can select an additional category of Perform to substitute.</p><p>The categories of Perform and their associated skills are Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p><p><b>Well-Versed (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, the skald becomes less susceptible to sonic effects. The skald gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against bardic performance, as well as all sonic or language-dependent effects.</p><p><b>Rage Powers (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32-34 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>) that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).</p><p>Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.</p><p>When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald's level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power's effects depend on the skald's ability modifier (such as <i>lesser spirit totem(</i>APG)), affected allies use the skald's ability modifier instead of their own for the purpose of this effect.</p><p>If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptive(APG), which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power's prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time by means of this ability (such as granting the superstition and disruptive rage powers simultaneously).</p><p>If a rage power can be used only a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage is subject to that limit (with abilities usable once per rage limited to once per inspired rage).</p><p>If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.</p><p>If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.</p><p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, a skald gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p><p>If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p><p><b>Spell Kenning (Su)</b>: At 5th level, a skald is learned in the magic of other spellcasters, and can use his own magic to duplicate those classes' spells. Once per day, a skald can cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or sorcerer/ wizard spell list as if it were one of his skald spells known, expending a skald spell slot of the same spell level to cast the desired spell. A spell cast with spell kenning always has a minimum casting time of 1 full round, regardless of the casting time of the spell.</p><p>At 11th level, a skald can use this ability twice per day. At 17th level, he can use this ability three times per day.</p><p><b>Lore Master (Ex)</b>: At 7th level, the skald becomes a master of many different types of lore, and can take 10 on any Knowledge check for which he has ranks. Once per day, the skald can take 20 on any Knowledge check as a standard action, instead of spending the normal amount of time that taking 20 requires. He can use this ability to take 20 on a Knowledge check twice per day at 13th level and three times per day at 19th level.</p><p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</b>: At 8th level, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least 4 more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.</p><p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.</p><p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex)</b>: At 9th level, a skald gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the skald takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 14th level and again at 19th level, this damage reduction increases by 1. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Additionally, the skald grants this damage reduction to all allies affected by his inspired rage.</p><p><b>Master Skald (Su)</b>: At 20th level, a skald's inspired rage no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills or abilities they can use. Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a barbarian's rage powers or a bloodrager's blood casting and bloodline abilities. Finally, when making a full attack, affected allies may make an additional attack each round (as if using a <i>haste</i>effect).</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1classes\">^Classes</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">Archetypes and Class Options</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"ISBQvxYeCeb9OKbi"}

When she calls upon one of this spirit's abilities, she grows in stature-becoming taller and more muscular, with a grimace of rage stretching across her face.</p><p><b>Spirit Magic Spells</b>: <i>Enlarge person</i>(1st), <i>fog cloud</i>(2nd), <i>magic vestment</i>(3rd), <i>wall of fire</i>(4th), <i>righteous might</i>(5th), <i>mass bull's strength</i>(6th), <i>control weather</i>(7th), <i>earthquake</i>(8th), <i>storm of vengeance</i>(9th).</p><p><b>Hexes</b>: A shaman who chooses the battle spirit can select from the following hexes.</p><p><i>Battle Master (Ex)</i>: The shaman makes an extra attack of opportunity each round. This ability stacks with the attacks of opportunity granted by the Combat Reflexes feat. At 8th level, the shaman gains the Weapon Specialization feat for a weapon of her choice as a bonus feat. At 16th level, the shaman gains the Greater Weapon Focus feat as a bonus feat, for the same weapon chosen for Weapon Specialization. The shaman doesn't need to meet the prerequisites of these feats.</p><p><i>Battle Ward (Su)</i>: The shaman touches a willing creature (including herself ) and grants a battle ward. The next time a foe makes an attack roll against the target, the ward activates and grants a +3 Deflection bonus to the warded creature's AC. Each subsequent time the warded creature is attacked, the defection bonus decreases by 1 (to +2 for the second time and +1 for the third). The ward fades when the bonus is reduced to +0 or after 24 hours, whichever comes first. At 8th level, the ward's starting bonus increases to +4. At 16th level, it increases to +5. A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.</p><p><i>Curse of Suffering (Su)</i>: The shaman causes a creature within 30 feet to take more damage from bleed effects and causes its wounds to heal at a slower rate. When the cursed creature takes bleed damage, it takes an additional 1 point of bleed damage (even if the bleed is ability damage). Furthermore, when the target is subject to an effect that would restore its hit points, that effect restores only half the normal amount of hit points. This curse lasts for a number of rounds equal to the shaman's level. A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.</p><p><i>Eyes of Battle (Su)</i>: The shaman's senses become magically heightened in the heat of battle. As a swift action, she can grant herself a +10 insight bonus for 1 round on Perception checks made to notice and pinpoint invisible creatures within 30 feet. She can instead use this ability as a swift action to ignore the effects of cover or partial cover (but not total cover) on her next attack, as long as that attack is made before the end of her next turn. The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her shaman level.</p><p><i>Hampering Hex (Su)</i>: The shaman causes a creature within 30 feet to take a -2 penalty to AC and CMD for a number of rounds equal to the shaman's level. A successful Will saving throw decreases this duration to just 1 round. At 8th level, the penalty becomes -4. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature affected by a hampering hex cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p><p><b>Spirit Animal</b>: The shaman's spirit animal looks like a fiercer version of its species, with rippling muscles and a stockier frame. It gains a +2 natural armor bonus to AC. If it already has a natural armor bonus, the bonus increases by 2 instead.</p><p><b>Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the battle spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability.</p><p><i>Battle Spirit (Su)</i>: A shaman surrounds herself with the spirit of battle. Allies within 30 feet of the shaman (including the shaman herself ) receive a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls. At 8th level and again at 16th level, these bonuses increase by 1. The shaman can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p><p><b>Greater Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the battle spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the greater version of that spirit.</p><p><i>Enemies' Bane (Su)</i>: As a swift action, the shaman imbues a single weapon she's wielding with the <i>bane</i>weapon special ability, choosing the type of creature affected each time she does. The effect lasts for 1 minute. If the weapon already has the <i>bane</i>weapon special ability of the type chosen, the additional damage dealt by <i>bane</i>increases to 4d6. The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.</p><p><b>True Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the battle spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the true version of that spirit.</p><p><i>Paragon of Battle (Su)</i>: As a standard action, the shaman assumes a form that combines the effects of <i>enlarge person</i>and <i>deadly juggernaut</i>(UC) for 1 minute or until dismissed. The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.</p><p><b>Manifestation</b>: Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes a spirit of battle. As a full-round action, she can make a full attack and move up to her speed (either before or after the attacks). Whenever she scores a critical hit, the attack ignores damage reduction. She gains a +4 insight bonus to AC for the purpose of confirming critical hits against her. If she is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, she does not die until her negative hit point total exceeds double her Constitution score.</p><h1>Bones</h1><p>A shaman who selects the bones spirit is cadaverously thin, with sunken eye sockets and dead eyes that stare off into the distance. Her body has a faint smell of the grave. When she calls upon one of this spirit's abilities, a ghostly wind whips her hair and clothes about, and the unpleasant stench becomes more prominent.</p><p><b>Spirit Magic Spells</b>: <i>Cause fear</i>(1st), <i>false life</i>(2nd), <i>animate dead</i>(3rd), <i>fear</i>(4th), <i>slay living</i>(5th), <i>circle of death</i>(6th), <i>control undead</i>(7th), <i>horrid wilting</i>(8th), <i>wail of the banshee</i>(9th).</p><p><b>Hexes</b>: A shaman who chooses the bones spirit can select from the following hexes.</p><p><i>Bone Lock (Su)</i>: With a quick incantation, the shaman causes a creature within 30 feet to suffer stiffness in its joints and bones, causing the target to be staggered 1 round. A successful Fortitude saving throw negates this effect. At 8th level, the duration increases to a number of rounds equal to her shaman level, though the target can attempt a save each round to end the effect if its initial saving throw fails. At 16th level, the target can no longer attempt a saving throw each round to end the effect, although it still attempts the initial Fortitude saving throw to negate the effect entirely.</p><p><i>Bone Ward (Su)</i>: The shaman touches a willing creature (including herself ) and grants a bone ward. The warded creature becomes encircled by a group of flying bones that grant it a +2 Deflection bonus to AC for a number of rounds equal to the shaman's level. At 8th level, the bonus increases to +3 and lasts for 1 minute. At 16th level, the bonus increases to +4 and lasts for 1 hour. A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.</p><p><i>Deathly Being (Su)</i>: If the shaman is a living creature, she reacts to positive and negative energy as if she were undead-positive energy harms her, while negative energy heals her. If she's an undead creature or a creature with the negative energy affinity ability, she gains a +1 bonus to her channel resistance. At 8th level, if she's a living creature, she gains a +4 bonus on saves against death effects and effects that drain energy; if she's an undead creature, her bonus to channel resistance increases to +2.</p><p>At 16th level, if the shaman a living creature, she takes no penalties from energy drain effects, though she can still be killed if she accrues more negative levels than she has Hit Dice. Furthermore, after 24 hours any negative levels the shaman has are removed without requiring her to succeed at an additional saving throw. If the shaman is an undead creature, her bonus to channel resistance increases to +4.</p><p><i>Fearful Gaze (Su)</i>: With a single shout, the shaman causes one target creature within 30 feet to become shaken for 1 round. A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. At 8th level, she makes the target frightened instead. At 16th level, she makes it panicked instead. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.</p><p><i>Grave Sight (Su)</i>: The shaman sees the states of life, death, undeath, and general health in those around her. When using this ability, she can tell whether or not creatures within 30 feet that she can see are living, wounded, dying, or dead, as well as determine if any are undead. Lastly, she can tell if those creatures are poisoned or diseased. The shaman can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to her shaman level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p><p><b>Spirit Animal</b>: The shaman's spirit animal gives off a ghostly glow and seems nearly transparent. The animal is under the constant effects of <i>blur</i>, with a caster level equal to the shaman's level.</p><p><b>Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the bones spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability.</p><p><i>Touch of the Grave (Su)</i>: As a standard action, the shaman can make a melee touch attack infused with negative energy that deals an amount of damage equal to 1d4 points + 1 point for every 2 shaman levels she possesses. She can instead touch an undead creature to heal it of the same amount of damage. A shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. At 11th level, any weapon that the shaman wields is treated as an <i>unholy</i>weapon.</p><p><b>Greater Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the bones spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the greater version of that spirit.</p><p><i>Shard Soul (Su)</i>: The shaman gains DR 3/magic. This DR increases by 1 for every 4 shaman levels she possesses beyond 8th. In addition, as a standard action she can cause jagged pieces of bone to explode from her body in a 10-foot-radius burst, dealing 1d6 points of piercing damage for every 2 shaman levels she possesses. A successful Reflex saving throw halves this damage. The shaman can use this ability three times per day, but she must wait 1d4 rounds between uses.</p><p><b>True Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the bones spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the true version of that spirit.</p><p><i>Shedding Form (Su)</i>: As a standard action, the shaman sheds her body and becomes incorporeal. While she is in this form, all of her weapon attacks are considered to have the <i>ghost touch</i>weapon special ability. She can use this ability for a number of rounds equal to her shaman level, but those rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p><p><b>Manifestation</b>: Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes a spirit of death. Once per round, she can cast <i>bleed</i>or <i>stabilize</i>as a free action. If she is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, she automatically stabilizes. She can cast <i>animate dead</i>at will without paying a material component cost, although she is still subject to the usual Hit Dice control limit. Once per day, she can cast <i>power word kill</i>, but the spell can target a creature with 150 hit points or fewer.</p><h1>Flame</h1><p>A shaman who selects the flame spirit has a radiant light behind her eyes and the faint smell of smoke about her. When she calls upon one of this spirit's abilities, a hungry spectral flame dances around her body.</p><p><b>Spirit Magic Spells</b>: <i>Burning hands</i>(1st), <i>resist energy</i>(2nd), <i>fireball</i>(3rd), <i>wall of fire</i>(4th), <i>summon monster V</i>(fire elementals only, 5th), <i>fire seeds</i>(6th), <i>fire storm</i>(7th), <i>incendiary cloud</i>(8th), <i>fiery body</i>(APG) (9th).</p><p><b>Hexes</b>: A shaman who chooses the flame spirit can select from the following hexes.</p><p><i>Cinder Dance (Ex)</i>: The shaman's base speed increases by 10 feet. At 5th level, the shaman receives Nimble Moves as a bonus feat. At 10th level, the shaman receives Acrobatic Steps as a bonus feat. The shaman doesn't need to meet the prerequisites of these feats.</p><p><i>Fire Nimbus (Su)</i>: The shaman causes a creature within 30 feet to gain a nimbus of fire. Though this nimbus doesn't harm the creature, it does cause the creature to emit light like a torch, preventing it from gaining any benefit from concealment or invisibility. The target also takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against spells or effects that deal fire damage. The fire nimbus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the shaman's level. A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. Whether or not the save is successful, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p><p><i>Flame Curse (Su)</i>: The shaman causes a creature within 30 feet to become vulnerable to fire (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i>305) until the end of the shaman's next turn. If the creature is already vulnerable to fire, this hex has no effect. Fire immunity and resistances apply as normal, and any saving throw allowed by the effect that caused the damage reduces it as normal. At 8th and 16th levels, the duration of this hex increases by 1 round. A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.</p><p><i>Gaze of Flames (Su)</i>: The shaman sees through fire, fog, and smoke without penalty as long as there is enough light to otherwise allow her to see normally. At 7th level, the shaman can gaze through any source of flame within 10 feet per shaman level, as <i>clairvoyance</i>. The shaman can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to her shaman level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p><p><i>Ward of Flames (Su)</i>: The shaman touches a willing creature (including herself ) and grants a ward of flames. The next time the warded creature is struck with a melee attack, the creature making the attack takes 1d6 points of fire damage + 1 point of fire damage for every 2 shaman levels she possesses. This ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not already expended. At 8th and 16th levels, the ward affects one additional attack. A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.</p><p><b>Spirit Animal</b>: The shaman's spirit animal is surrounded by a nimbus of flame that gives off light like a candle. This nimbus is warm to the touch, but doesn't cause any damage. The animal is immune to fire damage, but is vulnerable to cold damage (<i>Bestiary</i>305).</p><p><b>Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the flame spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability.</p><p><i>Touch of Flame (Su)</i>: As a standard action, the shaman can make a melee touch attack that deals 1d6 points of fire damage + 1 point for every 2 shaman levels she possesses. A shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. At 11th level, any weapon she wields is treated as a <i>flaming</i>weapon.</p><p><b>Greater Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the flame spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the greater version of that spirit.</p><p><i>Fiery Soul (Su)</i>: The shaman gains fire resistance 10. In addition, as a standard action she can unleash a 15-foot cone of flame from her mouth, dealing 1d4 points of fire damage per shaman level she possesses. A successful Reflex saving throw halves this damage. The shaman can use this ability three times per day, but she must wait 1d4 rounds between uses.</p><p><b>True Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the flame spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the true version of that spirit.</p><p><i>Elemental Form (Su)</i>: As a standard action, the shaman assumes the form of a Huge (or smaller) fire elemental, as per <i>elemental body IV</i>, with a duration of 1 hour per level. The shaman can use this ability once per day.</p><p><b>Manifestation</b>: Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes a spirit of flame. The shaman gains fire resistance 30. She can also apply any one of the following feats to any fire spell she casts without increasing the spell's level or casting time: Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Silent Spell, or Still Spell. She doesn't need to have these feats to use this ability.</p><h1>Heavens</h1><p>A shaman who selects the heavens spirit has eyes that sparkle like starlight, giving her an aura of otherworldliness. When she calls upon one of this spirit's abilities, her eyes turn pitch black and the colors around her drain for a brief moment.</p><p><b>Spirit Magic Spells</b>: <i>Color spray</i>(1st), <i>hypnotic pattern</i>(2nd), <i>daylight</i>(3rd), <i>rainbow pattern</i>(4th), <i>overland flight</i>(5th), <i>chain lightning</i>(6th), <i>prismatic spray</i>(7th), <i>sunburst</i>(8th), <i>meteor swarm</i>(9th).</p><p><b>Hexes</b>: A shaman who chooses the heavens spirit can select from the following hexes.</p><p><i>Enveloping Void (Su)</i>: The shaman curses one creature with the dark void. As a standard action, the shaman can cause one enemy within 30 feet to treat the light level as two steps lower: bright light becomes dim light, normal light becomes darkness, and areas of dim light and darkness become supernaturally dark (like darkness, but even creatures with darkvision cannot see). This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the shaman's level. A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. Whether or not the save is successful, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p><p><i>Guiding Star (Su)</i>: Whenever the shaman can see the open sky at night, she can determine her precise location and can add both her Wisdom modifier and her Charisma modifier on all Charisma-based skill checks. In addition, once per night while outdoors, she can cast one spell as if it were modified by the Empower Spell, Extend Spell, Silent Spell, or Still Spell feat without increasing the spell's casting time or level. The shaman doesn't need to possess these feats to use this ability.</p><p><i>Heaven's Leap (Su)</i>: The shaman is adept at creating tiny tears in the fabric of space, and temporarily stitching them together to reach other locations through a limited, one-way wormhole. As a standard action, the shaman can designate herself or a single ally that she can see who is within 30 feet of her. She can move that creature as if it were subject to <i>jester's jaunt</i>(APG). Once targeted by this hex, the ally cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p><p><i>Lure of the Heavens (Su)</i>: The shaman's connection to the skies above is so strong that her feet barely touch the ground. At 1st level, she no longer leaves tracks. At 5th level, she can hover up to 6 inches above the ground or liquid surfaces. At 10th level, the shaman gains the ability to cast <i>fly</i>(as per the spell) for a number of minutes per day equal to her shaman level. The duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p><p><i>Starburn (Su)</i>: As a standard action, the shaman causes one creature within 30 feet to burn like a star. The creature takes 1d6 points of fire damage for every 2 levels the shaman possesses and emits bright light for 1 round. A successful Fortitude saving throw halves the damage and negates the emission of bright light. The shaman can use this hex a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1), but she must wait 1d4 rounds between uses.</p><p><b>Spirit Animal</b>: The flesh of the shaman's spirit animal accurately reflects the stars that would be visible in the night sky, no matter where the animal is or the time of day. It can thus be used as a star map. In addition, it gains a fly speed of 5 feet; if the animal already has a fly speed, its fly speed increases by 10 feet. While the animal is flying, a small nimbus of light surrounds it.</p><p><b>Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the heavens spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability.</p><p><i>Stardust (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, the shaman causes stardust to materialize around one creature within 30 feet. This stardust causes the target to shed light as a candle, preventing it from gaining any benefit from concealment or invisibility. The creature takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls and sight-based Perception checks. This penalty on attack rolls and Perception checks increases by 1 at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of -6 at 20th level. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the shaman's level (minimum 1). Sightless creatures cannot be affected by this ability. The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.</p><p><b>Greater Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the heavens spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the greater version of that spirit.</p><p><i>Void Adaptation (Su):</i>The shaman gains darkvision out to 60 feet. If she already has darkvision, the range instead increases by 30 feet. In addition, the shaman can see in supernatural darkness, is constantly under the effects of <i>endure elements</i>, and doesn't need to breathe.</p><p><b>True Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the heavens spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the true version of that spirit.</p><p><i>Phantasmagoric Display (Sp)</i>: The shaman can cast <i>prismatic wall</i>and <i>prismatic spray,</i>each once per day, with a caster level equal to her shaman level.</p><p><b>Manifestation</b>: Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes the spirit of heaven. She receives a bonus on all saving throws equal to her Wisdom modifier. She automatically stabilizes if she is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points. She's immune to fear effects, and she automatically confirms all critical hits she threatens. If she dies, she's reborn 3 days later in the form of a star child, maturing over the course of 7 days (as <i>reincarnate</i>).</p><h1>Life</h1><p>A shaman who selects the life spirit appears more vibrant than most mortals. Her skin seems to glow, and her teeth are a pearly white. When she calls upon one of this spirit's abilities, her eyes and hair shimmer in the light.</p><p><b>Spirit Magic Spells</b>: <i>Detect undead</i>(1st), <i>lesser restoration</i>(2nd), <i>neutralize poison</i>(3rd), <i>restoration</i>(4th), <i>breath of life</i>(5th), <i>heal</i>(6th), <i>greater restoration</i>(7th), <i>mass heal</i>(8th), <i>true resurrection</i>(9th).</p><p><b>Hexes</b>: A shaman who chooses the life spirit can select from the following hexes.</p><p><i>Curse of Suffering (Su)</i>: The shaman causes a creature within 30 feet to take more damage from bleed effects and causes its wounds to heal at a slower rate. When the cursed creature takes bleed damage, it takes an additional 1 point of bleed damage (even if the bleed is ability damage). Furthermore, when the target is subject to an effect that would restore its hit points, that effect restores only half the normal amount of hit points. This curse lasts for a number of rounds equal to the shaman's level. A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.</p><p><i>Deny Succor (Su)</i>: The shaman can place this hex on a single creature within 30 feet. The target does not heal damage from cure spells and does not benefit from any spells or effects that remove conditions. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the shaman's level. A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. Whether or not the saving throw is successful, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p><p><i>Enhanced Cures (Su)</i>: When the shaman casts a cure spell, the maximum number of hit points healed is based on her shaman level, not the limit imposed by the spell. For example, an 11th-level shaman with this hex can cast <i>cure light wounds</i>to heal 1d8+11 hit points instead of the normal 1d8+5 maximum.</p><p><i>Life Link (Su)</i>: The shaman creates a bond between herself and another creature within 30 feet. Each round at the start of the shaman's turn, if the bonded creature is wounded for 5 or more hit points below its maximum hit points, it heals 5 hit points and the shaman takes 5 points of damage.</p><p>The shaman can have one bond active per shaman level. The bond continues until either the bonded creature dies, the shaman dies, the distance between her and the bonded creature exceeds 100 feet, or the shaman ends the bond as an immediate action. If the shaman has multiple bonds active, she can end as many as she wants with the same immediate action.</p><p><i>Life Sight (Ex)</i>: The shaman can see the states of life, death, and general health in those around her. When she uses this ability, she can tell whether or not creatures within 30 feet of her that she can see are living, wounded, dying, or dead. She can also tell if those creatures are confused, disabled, diseased, nauseated, poisoned, sickened, or staggered. At 12th level, when using life sight she is able to sense all nearby living creatures; this ability functions similarly to blindsight, but only for living creatures within 30 feet of her. The shaman can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to her shaman level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p><p><b>Spirit Animal</b>: The shaman's spirit animal appears to be a beautiful and very healthy version of its species, and seems especially vibrant and full of life. Her animal companion gains fast healing 1 (<i>Bestiary</i>300); if the spirit animal already has fast healing, its fast healing increases by 1.</p><p><b>Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the life spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability.</p><p><i>Channel (Su)</i>: The shaman can channel positive energy like a cleric, using her shaman level as her effective cleric level when determining the amount of damage healed (or dealt to undead) and the DC. The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + her Charisma modifier.</p><p><b>Greater Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the life spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the greater version of that spirit.</p><p><i>Healer's Touch (Su)</i>: The shaman gains a +4 bonus on Heal checks. As a standard action, the shaman can move up to half her speed and touch up to six dying creatures. Each creature automatically stabilizes without the need for a Heal check.</p><p><b>True Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the life spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the true version of that spirit.</p><p><i>Quick Healing (Su)</i>: The shaman calls upon her spirit to enhance the speed of her healing abilities. This ability allows her to channel positive energy or cast a cure spell as a swift action. The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma bonus.</p><p><b>Manifestation</b>: Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes a perfect channel for life energy. She gains immunity to bleed, death attacks, and negative energy, as well as to the exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, and sickened conditions. Ability damage and drain cannot reduce any of her ability scores to lower than 1. She automatically succeeds at saving throws against massive damage. When she is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, she doesn't die until her negative hit point total exceeds double her Constitution score.</p><h1>Lore</h1><p>A shaman who selects the lore spirit appears far wiser and knowing that her age would suggest. Though she can seem unassuming, her eyes give the impression that she is peering deep into all she looks at, seeing the secrets of the essential merely by concentrating.</p><p><b>Spirit Magic Spells</b>: <i>Identify</i>(1st), <i>tongues</i>(2nd), <i>locate object</i>(3rd), <i>legend lore</i>(4th), <i>contact other plane</i>(5th), <i>mass owl's wisdom</i>(6th), <i>vision</i>(7th), <i>moment of prescience</i>(8th), <i>time stop</i>(9th).</p><p><b>Hexes</b>: A shaman who chooses the lore spirit can select from the following hexes.</p><p><i>Arcane Enlightenment (Su)</i>: The shaman's native intelligence grants her the ability to tap into arcane lore. The shaman can add a number of spells from the sorcerer/wizard spell list equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1) to the list of shaman spells she can prepare. To cast these spells, she must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell's level, but the saving throw DCs of these spells are based on her Wisdom rather than Intelligence. When she casts these spells, they are treated as divine rather than arcane. Each time the shaman gains a level after taking this hex, she can choose to replace one of these spells with a new spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list.</p><p><i>Benefit of Wisdom</i>(Ex): The shaman relies on wisdom rather than intellect to gain and retain knowledge. She can use her Wisdom modifier instead of her Intelligence modifier on all Intelligence-based skill checks.</p><p><i>Brain Drain (Su)</i>: As a standard action, the shaman violently probes the mind of a single intelligent enemy within 30 feet. The target can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect. If it succeeds, it immediately knows the source of the mental prying; otherwise, it's wracked with pain and takes 1d4 points of damage for every 2 levels the shaman possesses. On the round following her successful use of this ability, the shaman can take a full-round action to sort through the jumble of stolen thoughts and memories and attempt a single Knowledge check using the victim's modifier for that skill. The random stolen thoughts remain in the shaman's mind for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1), and she can treat the knowledge gained as if she had used <i>detect thoughts</i>. This is a mind-affecting effect. Once she successfully affects a creature, she cannot use this hex on that creature again for 24 hours.</p><p><i>Confusion Curse (Ex)</i>: The shaman's command of lore can cause weaker minds to become mired in confusion. The shaman chooses a single creature with an Intelligence of 3 or more within 30 feet. That creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or become confused for a number of rounds equal to the shaman's Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Once affected by this hex, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p><p><i>Share Knowledge (Su)</i>: The shaman targets a single willing ally within 30 feet and shares her knowledge and experience with that target for a number of minutes equal to her Charisma bonus. During that time, the subject knows the languages that the shaman knows and uses the shaman's skill modifier on all Knowledge checks instead of its own. A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.</p><p><b>Spirit Animal</b>: The shaman's spirit animal appears to be quiet and unassuming. It gains a +2 bonus on Initiative checks and a +4 bonus on Stealth checks.</p><p><b>Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the lore spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability.</p><p><i>Monstrous Insight (Su)</i>: The shaman can identify creatures and gain insight into their strengths and weaknesses. As a standard action, the shaman can attempt a Knowledge check to identify a creature and its abilities (using the appropriate skill for the monster's type) with an insight bonus equal to her shaman level. Whether or not the check is successful, she also gains a +2 insight bonus for 1 minute on attack rolls made against that creature and a +2 insight bonus to her AC against attacks made by that creature. These bonuses last for 1 minute. The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.</p><p><b>Greater Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the lore spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the greater version of that spirit.</p><p><i>Automatic Writing (Su)</i>: Once per day, the shaman can spend 10 minutes in uninterrupted meditation to tap into greater understanding. During this period, her hands produce mysterious writings pertaining to the future. This writing takes the form of <i>divination</i>with 90% effectiveness. The shaman can use this ability an additional time per day at 12th, 16th, and 20th levels.</p><p><b>True Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the lore spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the true version of that spirit.</p><p><i>Perfect Knowledge (Ex)</i>: The shaman gains the benefit of the <i>tongues</i>spell permanently. She also gains a +10 competence bonus on all Knowledge, Linguistics, and Spellcraft checks.</p><p><b>Manifestation</b>: Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes an unending font of knowledge and lore. She can take 20 on all Knowledge checks, including checks for skills in which she isn't trained. Her understanding of the fundamental underpinnings of reality has also become so advanced that she can cast <i>wish</i>once per day. This doesn't require a material component, but the <i>wish</i>cannot be used to grant ability score bonuses or to replicate spells with expensive material components.</p><h1>Nature</h1><p>A shaman who selects the nature spirit takes on an appearance that reflects the aspect of the natural world she has the closest connection to. A nature shaman from the forest has a green tinge to her skin and hair, with eyes of sparkling emerald and the scent of green leaves and flowers about her. A nature shaman from the tundra is typically alabaster pale, with platinum hair and crystal blue eyes, and her skin always seems strangely cold.</p><p><b>Spirit Magic Spells</b>: <i>Charm animal</i>(1st), <i>barkskin</i>(2nd), <i>speak with plants</i>(3rd), <i>grove of respite</i>(APG) (4th), <i>awaken</i>(5th), <i>stone tell</i>(6th), <i>creeping doom</i>(7th), <i>animal shapes</i>(8th), <i>world wave</i>(APG) (9th).</p><p><b>Hexes</b>: A shaman who chooses the nature spirit can select from the following hexes.</p><p><i>Entangling Curse (Su)</i>: The shaman entangles a creature within 30 feet for a number of rounds equal to the shaman's Charisma modifier (minimum 1). A successful Reflex saving throw negates this effect. Whether or not the save is successful, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p><p><i>Erosion Curse (Su)</i>: The shaman summons the powers of nature to erode a construct or an object within 30 feet. This erosion deals 1d6 points of damage per 2 shaman levels, ignoring hardness and damage reduction. If used against a construct or an object in another creature's possession, the construct or the creature possessing the object can attempt a Reflex saving throw to halve the damage. Once an object or a construct is damaged by this erosion, it cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p><p><i>Friend to Animals (Su)</i>: The shaman can spontaneously cast <i>summon nature's ally</i>spells, as per the druid's spontaneous casting. In addition, all animals within 30 feet of the shaman receive a sacred bonus on all saving throws equal to the shaman's Charisma bonus.</p><p><i>Speak with Animals (Ex)</i>: Choose a specific kind of animal: eagle, fox, dog, and so on. The shaman gains the ability to converse with that kind of animal as if she were under the effects of <i>speak with animal</i>. The shaman gains the ability to communicate with an additional kind of animal for every 3 shaman levels she possesses (two kinds at 3rd level, three at 6th, and so on, to a maximum of seven at 18th level).</p><p><i>Stormwalker (Su)</i>: The shaman can move through nonmagical fog, rain, mist, snow, and other environmental effects without penalty (see Weather, <i>Core Rulebook</i>437). She is never slowed by such effects, and she doesn't need to attempt Acrobatics checks to move across such surfaces. She can also move through magical environmental effects that she created. At 10th level, the shaman can see twice as far as normal through environmental effects, whether or not they are magical in nature.</p><p><b>Spirit Animal</b>: The shaman's spirit animal looks feral, and appears to be in peak physical form. The animal can move through any sort of undergrowth or natural difficult terrain at its normal speed without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. If the animal has a fly speed, it can ignore the penalty on Fly checks for winds up to windstorm strength (<i>Core Rulebook</i>439).</p><p><b>Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the nature spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability.</p><p><i>Storm Burst (Su)</i>: As a standard action, the shaman causes a small storm of swirling wind and rain to form around one creature within 30 feet. This storm causes the target to treat all foes as if they had concealment, imposing a 20% miss chance for 1 round plus 1 round for every 4 shaman levels she possesses. The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. At 11th level, any weapon she wields is treated as a <i>thundering</i>weapon.</p><p><b>Greater Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the nature spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the greater version of that spirit.</p><p><i>Spirit of Nature (Su)</i>: Whenever the shaman is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, she automatically stabilizes and gains fast healing 1 for 1d4 rounds. At 15th level, this benefit increases to fast healing 3.</p><p><b>True Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the nature spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the true version of that spirit.</p><p><i>Companion Animal (Su)</i>: The shaman's spirit animal takes the form of an animal companion (<i>Core Rulebook</i>51) of her choice, using her shaman level as her effective druid level. The animal retains all the special abilities and the Intelligence score of the spirit animal, but also has the statistics and abilities of an animal companion. If the animal is dismissed, is lost, or dies, it can be replaced in the same way as a normal spirit animal can be.</p><p><b>Manifestation</b>: Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes a spirit of nature. Once per day, she can surround herself with an organic cocoon of silk as a full-round action. While enclosed in the cocoon, she's considered helpless. Eight hours later, she emerges, having changed her type to plant, animal, or humanoid, and having gained superficial physical characteristics of the chosen type as appropriate (<i>Bestiary</i>306-310). She must choose a type that is different from her current type. This effect doesn't alter her Hit Dice, hit points, saving throws, skill ranks, class skills, or proficiencies. The effect is permanent until the shaman chooses to transform again. Each time she transforms, the shaman is cleansed of all poisons and diseases, restored to full hit points, and healed of all ability damage.</p><h1>Stone</h1><p>The skin of a shaman who selects the stone spirit takes on a rough, stony appearance. When the shaman calls upon one of this spirit's abilities, tiny gemstones underneath her flesh pulse with a bright glow, like phosphorescent geodes glittering in a dark cave.</p><p><b>Spirit Magic Spells</b>: <i>Magic stone</i>(1st), <i>stone call</i>(APG) (2nd), <i>meld into stone</i>(3rd), <i>wall of stone</i>(4th), <i>stoneskin</i>(5th), <i>stone tell</i>(6th), <i>statue</i>(7th), <i>repel metal and stone</i>(8th), <i>clashing rocks</i>(APG) (9th).</p><p><b>Hexes</b>: A shaman who chooses the stone spirit can select from the following hexes.</p><p><i>Crystal Sight (Ex)</i>: The shaman sees through stone, earth, or sand as easily as if it were transparent crystal. Her gaze can penetrate a number of feet equal to her shaman level (or a number of inches equal to her shaman level of metal). The shaman can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to her shaman level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p><p><i>Lodestone (Su)</i>: The shaman causes one creature within 30 feet to become heavy and lethargic. The creature is treated as if it were carrying a medium load (see Table 7-5 on page 171 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>). If the creature is already carrying a medium load, it is instead treated as if it were carrying a heavy load. If the creature is carrying a heavy load, its maximum Dexterity bonus to AC is reduced to +0, it takes a -9 armor check penalty, and its movement speeds are reduced to 5 feet. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the shaman's level. A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. Whether or not the save is successful, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p><p><i>Metal Curse (Su)</i>: The shaman causes a creature within 30 feet to become slightly magnetic until the end of the shaman's next turn. Whenever the creature is attacked with a melee or ranged weapon constructed primarily of metal, it takes a -2 penalty to AC. At 8th and 16th levels, the penalty increases by -2 and the duration increases by 1 round. Once affected, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p><p><i>Stone Stability (Ex)</i>: The shaman receives a +4 bonus to her CMD when resisting bull rush or trip attempts as long as she is standing on the ground. At 5th level, the shaman receives Improved Trip as a bonus feat. At 10th level, the shaman receives Greater Trip as a bonus feat. The shaman does not need to meet the prerequisites of these feats.</p><p><i>Ward of Stone (Su)</i>: The shaman touches a willing creature (including herself ) and grants a ward of stone. The next time the warded creature is struck with a melee attack, it is treated as if it has DR 5/adamantine. This ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not already expended. At 8th and 16th levels, the ward lasts for one additional attack. A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.</p><p><b>Spirit Animal</b>: The shaman's spirit animal looks as though it's made out of earth and stone, with tiny gemstones embedded in its flesh. The animal gains DR 5/adamantine.</p><p><b>Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the stone spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability.</p><p><i>Touch of Acid (Su)</i>: As a standard action, the shaman can make a melee touch attack that deals an amount of acid damage equal to 1d6 points + 1 point for every 2 shaman levels she possesses. A shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. At 11th level, any weapon she wields is treated as a <i>corrosive</i>(UE) weapon.</p><p><b>Greater Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the stone spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the greater version of that spirit.</p><p><i>Body of Earth (Su)</i>: The shaman gains DR 2/adamantine. This DR increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 8th the shaman possesses. In addition, as a standard action, she can cause jagged pieces of stone to explode from her body in a 10-foot-radius burst, dealing 1d6 points of piercing damage per 2 shaman levels she possesses. A successful Reflex saving throw halves this damage. The shaman can use this ability three times per day, but she must wait 1d4 rounds between uses.</p><p><b>True Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the stone spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the true version of that spirit.</p><p><i>Elemental Form (Su)</i>: As a standard action, the shaman assumes the form of a Huge (or smaller) earth elemental, as <i>elemental body IV</i>, with a duration of 1 hour per level. The shaman can use this ability once per day.</p><p><b>Manifestation</b>: Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes a being of acid and earth. The shaman gains acid resistance 30. She can also apply any one of the following feats to any acid or earth spell she casts without increasing the spell's level or casting time: Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Silent Spell, or Still Spell. She doesn't need to possess these feats to use this ability.</p><h1>Waves</h1><p>A shaman who selects the waves spirit has a fluid grace that exhibits itself whenever she moves. When she calls upon one of this spirit's abilities, floating orbs dance about her, sublimating between icy crystals, misty vapors, and globules of water.</p><p><b>Spirit Magic Spells</b>: <i>Hydraulic push</i>(APG) (1st), <i>slipstream</i>(APG) (2nd), <i>water breathing</i>(3rd), <i>wall of ice</i>(4th), <i>geyser</i>(APG) (5th), <i>fluid form</i>(APG) (6th), <i>vortex</i>(APG) (7th), <i>seamantle</i>(APG) (8th), <i>tsunami</i>(APG) (9th).</p><p><b>Hexes</b>: A shaman who chooses the waves spirit can select from the following hexes.</p><p><i>Beckoning Chill (Su)</i>: The shaman causes one creature within 30 feet to become more susceptible to the sapping powers of cold for 1 minute. When a creature takes cold damage while under this effect, it is entangled for 1 round.</p><p>If the creature takes cold damage while already entangled by beckoning chill, the duration of the entangled condition increases by 1 round. Once affected, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p><p><i>Crashing Waves (Su)</i>: The force of a waves shaman's water spells can bring even the mightiest foes to the ground. When the shaman casts a spell with the water descriptor, she does so at 1 caster level higher. If that spell deals damage, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be knocked prone. At 8th level, the shaman casts water spells at 2 caster levels higher. At 16th level, her ability to knock creatures prone extends to any spell that deals damage.</p><p><i>Fluid Magic (Su)</i>: The shaman's magic is not constrained by the reservoirs of magic that hold others back. She is able to prepare her spirit magic spells in her regular spell slots. If the shaman changes her wandering spirit, any prepared spirit magic spell belonging to that spirit becomes an open spell slot.</p><p><i>Mist's Shroud (Su)</i>: The shaman touches a willing creature (including herself ) and enshrouds that creature in mist. This grants the creature concealment, as per the <i>blur</i>spell. The mist dissipates after it causes an attack to miss because of concealment or after 1 minute, whichever comes first. At 8th and 16th levels, the mist lasts for one additional attack. A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.</p><p><i>Water Sight (Su)</i>: The shaman sees through fog and mist without penalty as long as there is enough light to otherwise allow her to see normally. At 7th level, she can use <i>scrying</i>, with any calm pool of water that's at least 1 foot in diameter as the sole focus. At 15th level, this ability functions as <i>greater scrying</i>. She can use these abilities for a number of rounds per day equal to her shaman level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p><p><b>Spirit Animal</b>: The skin of the shaman's spirit animal constantly distorts, much as a pond's surface ripples when drops of water fall gently onto it. The animal gains Mobility as a bonus feat. The animal doesn't need to meet the prerequisites for this feat. In addition, the animal can breathe underwater.</p><p><b>Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the waves spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability.</p><p><i>Wave Strike (Su)</i>: As a standard action, the shaman can perform a melee touch attack that drenches a creature and pushes it away. The opponent takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage + 1 point for every 2 shaman levels the shaman possesses and is pushed 5 feet directly away from the shaman. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. At 11th level, any melee weapon she wields is treated as if it had the <i>quenching</i>(UE) special ability.</p><p><b>Greater Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the waves spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the greater version of that spirit.</p><p><i>Fluid Mastery (Su)</i>: The shaman gains a swim speed equal to her base land speed, as well as the ability to breathe underwater. In addition, she can unleash a torrent of ice and water from her hands in a 15-foot cone as a standard action. This torrent deals 1d4 points of cold damage per 2 shaman level she possesses, and pushes affected creatures back 5 feet directly away from the shaman. A successful Reflex saving throw halves the damage and negates the push. The shaman can use this ability three times per day, but she must wait 1d4 rounds between uses.</p><p><b>True Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the waves spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the true version of that spirit.</p><p><i>Elemental Form (Su)</i>: As a standard action, the shaman assumes the form of a Huge (or smaller) water elemental, as <i>elemental body IV</i>, with a duration of 1 hour per level. The shaman can use this ability once per day.</p><p><b>Manifestation</b>: Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes a master of cold and water. The shaman gains cold resistance 30. She can also apply any one of the following feats to any cold or water spell she casts without increasing the spell's level or casting time: Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Silent Spell, or Still Spell. She doesn't need to possess these feats to use this ability.</p><h1>Wind</h1><p>A shaman who selects the wind spirit appears windswept, and her movements seem lithe and carefree.</p><p><b>Spirit Magic Spells</b>: <i>Alter winds</i>(APG) (1st), <i>gust of wind</i>(2nd), <i>cloak of winds</i>(APG) (3rd), <i>river of wind</i>(APG) (4th), <i>control winds</i>(5th), <i>sirocco</i>(APG) (6th), <i>control weather</i>(7th), <i>whirlwind</i>(8th), <i>winds of vengeance</i>(APG) (9th).</p><p><b>Hexes</b>: A shaman who chooses the wind spirit can select from the following hexes.</p><p><i>Air Barrier (Su)</i>: The shaman creates an invisible shell of air that grants her a +4 armor bonus to AC. At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 2. At 13th level, this barrier causes incoming arrows, rays, and other ranged attacks requiring an attack roll against her to suffer a 50% miss chance. The shaman can use this barrier for 1 hour per shaman level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-hour increments.</p><p><i>Sparking Aura (Su)</i>: The shaman causes a creature within 30 feet to spark and shimmer with electrical energy. Though this effect does not harm the creature, it does cause the creature to emit light like a torch, preventing it from gaining any benefit from concealment or invisibility. Furthermore, while the aura lasts, whenever the target is hit with a metal melee weapon, it also takes an amount of electricity damage equal to the shaman's Charisma bonus. The sparking aura lasts 1 round for every 2 shaman levels the shaman possesses. A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.</p><p><i>Vortex Spells (Su)</i>: Whenever the shaman confirms a critical hit against an opponent with a spell, the target is staggered for 1 round. At 11th level, the duration increases to 1d4 rounds.</p><p><i>Wind Sight (Su)</i>: The shaman ignores the penalties on Perception checks caused by wind and the first 100 feet of distance. At 7th level she can, as a standard action, hear or see into any area-as <i>clairaudience</i>or <i>clairvoyance</i>, using that spell's range-provided air can travel between the shaman and the target area via an unobstructed path. This doesn't require line of effect, meaning the path can turn corners and go through spaces as narrow as 1 inch in diameter. The shaman can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to her shaman level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p><p><i>Wind Ward (Su)</i>: The shaman can touch a willing creature (including herself ) and grant a ward of wind. This ward lasts for a number of rounds equal to the shaman's level. When a warded creature is attacked with an arrow, ray, or other ranged attack that requires an attack roll, that attack suffers a 20% miss chance. At 8th level, the ward lasts for 1 minute for every shaman level the shaman possesses. At 16th level, the miss chance increases to 50%. Once affected, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p><p><b>Spirit Animal</b>: The shaman's spirit animal crackles with electrical energy when it moves, giving off light like a candle. This electricity deals no damage to the animal or any creature that touches the animal.

In addition, as a standard action she can unleash a 20- foot line of sparks from her fingertips, dealing 1d4 points of electricity damage per shaman level she possesses. A successful Reflex saving throw halves this damage. The shaman can use this ability three times per day, but she must wait 1d4 rounds between uses.</p><p><b>True Spirit Ability</b>: A shaman who chooses the wind spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the true version of that spirit.</p><p><i>Elemental Form (Su)</i>: As a standard action, the shaman assumes the form of a Huge (or smaller) lightning elementalB2, as per <i>elemental body IV</i>, with a duration of 1 hour per level. The shaman can use this ability once per day.</p><p><b>Manifestation</b>: Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes a being of air and electricity. The shaman gains electricity resistance 30. She can also apply any one of the following feats to any air or electricity spell she casts without increasing the spell's level or casting time: Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Silent Spell, or Still Spell. She doesn't need to possess these feats to use this ability.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1classes\">^Classes</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">Archetypes and Class Options</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"JMypNY4ORf6eBgR9"}

A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman's spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard's arcane bond class feature, and the animal is treated as a familiar (see pages 78 and 82 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>), except as noted below.</p><p>A shaman uses her shaman level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman's spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.</p><p>Levels of different classes that are entitled to gain familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman's level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used for familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman's spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.</p><p>If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be the same kind of creature as the previous one.</p><p><i>Spirit Animal (Ex)</i>: At 1st level, a shaman's spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal's appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p><p><i>Deliver Touch Spells (Su)</i>: If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the \"toucher.\" The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn't have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1classes\">^Classes</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">Archetypes and Class Options</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"JV4Ew6snAGMBccMF"}

A counterfeit mage goes a step further, parroting the motions and phrases used by arcane casters to activate wands or other magical accoutrements.

A counterfeit mage can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Signature Wand (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, a counterfeit mage can spend 1 hour practicing with a wand to designate it as his signature wand.

She adds her Intelligence modifier to damage dealt with splash weapons, including any splash damage. She adds 1/2 her level to Craft (alchemy) checks. This ability replaces evasion.</p><p><b>Precise Splash Weapons (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, an underground chemist can deal sneak attack damage with splash weapons.

These bards focus that raw power into powerful song and dance.</p><h1>FLAME DANCER (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>A flame dancer studies the movements of fire, adding its grace to his repertoire. He seeks truth in fire's burning essence, and uses his performance to unleash the power of fire against those who dare oppose him.</p><p><b>Bardic Performance</b>: A flame dancer gains the following bardic performances.</p><p><i>Fire Dance (Su)</i>: At 1st level, a fire dancer learns to protect himself and others from the pain of fire, and discovers how to control the flame while enduring its heat. Each round of the fire dance, he rolls a Perform (dance or sing) check. Any ally within 30 feet of the bard that has caught on fire or is affected by a fire effect or extreme heat can use the bard's Perform check result in place of its saving throw result against that fire. Any ally within 30 feet of the bard who is suffering from heatstroke can ignore the fatigue from heat exposure so long as the bard maintains this performance. Fire dance relies on audible or visual components. This ability replaces countersong.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><i>Song of the Fiery Gaze (Su)</i>: At 3rd level, a fire dancer can allow allies to see through flames without any distortion. Any ally within 30 feet of the bard who can hear the performance can see through fire, fog, and smoke without penalty as long as the light is sufficient to allow him to see normally, as with the base effect of the gaze of flames oracle revelation (<i>Advanced Player's Guide</i>47). Song of the fiery gaze relies on audible components. This ability replaces inspire competence.</p><p><i>Fire Break (Su)</i>: At 6th level, a fire dancer's performance can bend flames away from others. Any ally within 30 feet of the bard who can hear or see the bardic performance gains resist fire 20 as long as the performance is maintained. At 11th level, this resistance increases to 30. Fire break relies on audible or visual components. This ability replaces suggestion.</p><p><b>Fan the Flames (Su)</b>: At 8th level, a fire dancer adds <i>burning hands</i>, <i>flaming sphere</i>, and <i>fireball</i>to his list of bard spells known (as a 1st-, a 2nd-, and a 3rd-level spell, respectively). This ability replaces dirge of doom.</p><h1>VOICE OF THE WILD (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Most bards are inspired by the art of civilization, yet the voice of the wild's muse is the grandeur of nature. The voice of the wild has discovered nature's magical secrets, and can use his performance to bring out the bestial side in his allies.</p><p><b>Wild Knowledge (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a voice of the wild adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) to all Knowledge (nature) checks. He can use Knowledge (geography) and Knowledge (nature) untrained. This ability replaces bardic knowledge.</p><p><b>Nature Magic</b>: At 1st level, a voice of the wild can select a 1st-level druid or ranger spell as a bard spell known instead of a spell from the bard spell list. The voice of the wild can select another druid or ranger spell (of any bard spell level he can cast) at 4th, 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels. If he chooses to learn a new spell in place of a druid or ranger spell he already knows, he can choose a replacement from the bard, druid, or ranger spell list. This ability replaces countersong, all instances of versatile performance, and jack-of-all-trades.</p><p><b>Bardic Performance</b>: Voices of the wild gain the following bardic performance.</p><p><i>Song of the Wild (Su)</i>: At 3rd level, the voice of the wild can use bardic performance to apply an animal aspect to an ally, as if using the hunter's animal focus class feature. The ally must be able to hear or see the performance. The voice of the wild uses his bard level as his hunter level for determining the effect of the animal aspect. The bard can affect a second ally with this performance at 10th level and a third at 17th level. Song of the wild relies on audible or visual components. This ability replaces all instances of inspire competence, dirge of doom, and inspire heroics.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"KrCSoGuBOFianftb"}

Some shamans don't just commune with the spirits, but also let them inhabit their bodies. Others look for guidance from whichever spirit would serve them best at the time.</p><h1>ANIMIST (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Even among mystical practitioners, the animist has a strange perspective and even stranger magic. The animist perceives that all things have a spirit, including objects, constructs, illnesses, buildings, and the environment.</p><p><b>Animist Spirit Magic</b>: The animist adds the following spells to the list of spells he can cast using spirit magic: <i>speak with animals</i>(1st), <i>skinsend</i>(UM) (2nd), <i>speak with plants</i>(3rd), <i>malfunction</i>(UM) (4th), <i>dream</i>(5th), <i>speak with stone</i>(6th), <i>control construct</i>(UM) (7th), <i>trap the soul</i>(8th), and <i>soul bind</i>(9th). This ability replaces the spirit magic spells gained from the shaman's spirit.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Wrangle Condition (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, the animist interacts directly with unwholesome spirits of the ills that trouble him or his people. To the animist, negative conditions manifest as anthropomorphic spirits or are caused by such spirits (visited upon the creature by bad magic). Either way, the animist can attempt to persuade the spirit to leave its victim alone, thus performing a miraculous healing. As the animist grows in power, he can simply inform these spirits that they are unwelcome and command them to depart.</p><p>The animist can attempt a Diplomacy check to persuade the condition's spirit to leave. Conditions the animist can affect are ranked from minor to dire, with each category having an accompanying Diplomacy DC (see below). The animist cannot take 10 or take 20 on the check or receive aid from any creature except another shaman. Failure by 5 or less means the condition's spirit is willing to leave the target and transfer to the animist for the rest of the duration or until cured; this transfer happens only if the animist is willing. Failure by 10 or more means that not only is the target afflicted with the condition, but the animist is as well (whether or not he is willing) for the rest of the duration or until cured.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><i>Minor Conditions</i>(DC 15): Fatigued, shaken, and sickened.</p><p><i>Major Conditions</i>(DC 20): Dazed and staggered.</p><p><i>Severe Conditions</i>(DC 25): Exhausted, frightened, and nauseated.</p><p><i>Dire Conditions</i>(DC 30): Blinded, deafened, paralyzed, and stunned.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>The animist can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his shaman level + his Wisdom modifier. Using this ability is a standard action that requires no contact or shared language with the target, but it relies on audible components and the target must be within 30 feet. If a target is afflicted with multiple conditions, the animist targets one condition at a time (of his choosing). The animist cannot use this ability on himself.</p><p>At 5th level, the animist can use this ability to exorcise minor conditions without needing to attempt a Diplomacy check. He can dispatch major conditions without a check at 9th level, severe conditions at 13th level, and dire conditions at 17th level. Doing so still requires one use of this ability per condition.</p><p>This ability replaces the hex gained at 2nd level.</p><p><b>Exorcism (Su)</b>: At 8th level, the animist can attempt to end effects that control a creature or object, such as <i>magic jar</i>, <i>possess object</i>(UM), <i>dominate person</i>, and <i>dominate monster</i>, or that involve possessing entities such as ghosts. This is a full-round action that requires the animist to touch the target. The possessing or dominating creature must attempt a Will save with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the animist's shaman level + his Wisdom modifier. Failure means that the controlling effect ends or the entity is immediately cast out of the target, as appropriate. If the possessing entity is exorcised, it cannot attempt to dominate or possess that target again for 24 hours. The animist can exorcise the same entity out of different targets, but once the entity successfully saves against the animist's exorcism, it cannot be affected by this ability again for 24 hours. This ability replaces the hex gained at 8th level.</p><p><b>Dominate Spirit (Sp)</b>: At 10th level, the animist can attempt to possess creatures or objects, as per <i>magic jar</i>or <i>possess object</i>(UM). When the animist is attempting to possess the creature, his familiar acts as the jar and must be within 10 feet. The animist's soul can perceive his surroundings through the familiar's senses, clearly evaluate potential targets for possession, and communicate with his familiar telepathically. The familiar retains its autonomy while acting as the jar, and is not harmed by being used as a vessel for the animist's soul. The animist can use this ability once per day at 10th level, plus an additional time per day every 4 levels thereafter. This ability replaces the hex gained at 10th level.</p><p><b>Contact with the Spirit World (Su)</b>: At 12th level, the animist can interact with incorporeal entities as if his unarmed strikes and melee weapons had the <i>ghost touch</i>weapon special ability. While using this ability, he can also see nearby ethereal entities and likewise strike at them as if they were incorporeal. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his shaman level. This duration does not need to be consecutive. This ability replaces the hex gained at 12th level.</p><p><b>Etherealness (Sp)</b>: At 18th level, the animist can cast <i>etherealness</i>once per day as a spell-like ability. This ability replaces the hex gained at 18th level.</p><p><b>Spirit Shaman (Sp)</b>: At 20th level, the animist can use <i>ethereal jaunt</i>at will as a spell-like ability, and can cast <i>astral projection</i>once per day as a spell-like ability. This ability replaces manifestation.</p><h1>POSSESSED SHAMAN (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>For a possessed shaman, merely communing with the spirit world is insufficient. Instead, she invites the spirits to share her body, granting them the chance to experience corporeal existence. In return, they grant her their skills and protect her from otherworldly influence.</p><p><b>Shared Skill (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a possessed shaman selects two skills. Both of these skills must have the same key ability. The possessed shaman treats these skills as if she had a number of ranks in them equal to her shaman level, and uses her Wisdom modifier in place of the ability modifier the skills would normally use. If either of the skills are class skills for her, she receives the usual +3 bonus on those checks for having ranks in those skills. These ranks do not stack with her actual skill ranks (only the higher number of ranks in a given skill applies). This ability replaces spirit magic.</p><p><b>Crowded Vessel (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, whenever a possessed shaman fails a saving throw against a charm or compulsion spell or effect, she can attempt a new saving throw (using the original DC) at the end of her next turn as the spirits inside her attempt to regain control. If the saving throw is successful, the charm or compulsion effect ends. If the saving throw fails, she is affected as normal for the rest of the duration. This ability replaces the hex gained at 2nd level.</p><p><b>Wandering Skills (Su)</b>: At 6th level, a possessed shaman is able to make room for another spirit. When choosing her wandering spirit for the day, the possessed shaman chooses one skill. The possessed shaman treats this skill as if she had a number of ranks in it equal to her shaman level, and uses her Wisdom modifier in place of the ability modifier the skill would normally use. If the skill is a class skill for her, she receives the usual +3 bonus on checks for having ranks in that skill. Each time the possessed shaman changes her wandering spirit, she can change the skill gained through this ability. These ranks do not stack with her actual skill ranks (only the higher number of ranks in the chosen skill applies). This ability replaces the wandering hex gained at 6th level.</p><h1>SPEAKER FOR THE PAST (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>A speaker for the past is a shaman who serves as the voice for spirits from her people's history. A speaker for the past is often an advocate of the ancestors of a specific group, the voice of experience, and a powerful resource that enables the past to aid the present.</p><p><b>Mysteries of the Past</b>: A speaker for the past gains Linguistics, Knowledge (history), Knowledge (local), Perception, and Use Magic Device as class skills. Also, she adds the spells from the ancestor(UM) and time(UM) oracle mysteries to her class spell list (at the cleric level for those spells).</p><p>This ability replaces the shaman's familiar. The speaker for the past must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation to regain her daily allotment of spells, but does not need to commune with a familiar during this time. Because she has no familiar, she does not gain a spirit familiar feature from any spirit she bonds with.</p><h1>SPEAKER FOR THE PAST (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p><b>Revelations of the Past</b>: At 4th, 6th, 12th, 14th, and 20th levels, the speaker for the past can select a revelation from the ancestor mystery or the time mystery. She uses her shaman level as her oracle level for these revelations, and uses her Wisdom modifier in place of her Charisma modifier for the purposes of the revelation. This ability replaces wandering spirit and wandering hex.</p><h1>SPIRIT WARDEN (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Not all spirits deserve reverence and respect. Some are twisted and despicable. It's a spirit warden's duty to end these spirits' existence.</p><p><b>Unnatural Mien (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, the spirit warden's dealings with the spirit world give her an unsettling demeanor. Diplomacy and Handle Animal are not class skills for a spirit warden. Intimidate is added as a class skill, and she gains a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks to demoralize a foe.</p><p><b>Restless Magic (Su)</b>: The spirit warden adds the following spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic: <i>detect undead</i>(1st), <i>command undead</i>(2nd), <i>halt undead</i>(3rd), <i>death ward</i>(4th), <i>possess object</i>(UM) (5th), <i>undead to death</i>(6th), <i>ethereal jaunt</i>(7th), <i>control undead</i>(8th), and <i>foresight</i>(9th). This ability replaces the spirit magic spells gained from the shaman's spirit.</p><p><b>Rebuke Spirits (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, the spirit warden gains the ability to channel positive energy as a cleric of her level. Regardless of her alignment, she can use this ability only to harm undead creatures. The spirit warden can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. This ability replaces the hex gained at 2nd level.</p><p><b>Laugh at Death (Su)</b>: At 10th level, the spirit warden's familiarity with the dead has filled her with contempt for death itself. She gains a +4 insight bonus on saving throws against death effects and to avoid or remove negative levels. This ability replaces the hex gained at 10th level.</p><h1>UNSWORN SHAMAN (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>An unsworn shaman never binds herself to one specific spirit, always making new deals as she deems necessary for the circumstances that she finds herself in. While this vacillation weakens the powers she can access from any one spirit, it gives her access to a broader overall range of abilities.</p><p><b>Minor Spirit (Su)</b>: At 1st level, the unsworn shaman forms a temporary bond with a minor spirit each day, granting her access to a shaman or witch hex of her choosing, but not a major hex or a grand hex. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells for the day. Until she changes the minor spirit, she continues to have access to the shaman or witch hex. At 2nd level, she can instead select a hex from one of her wandering spirits selected for that day. If she selects a witch hex, she treats her shaman level as her witch level and uses her Wisdom in place of her Intelligence for the purpose of that hex.</p><p>She can make temporary bonds with two minor spirits (thus gaining two hexes) at 4th level, and with one additional minor spirit (and hex) every 4 levels thereafter. This ability replaces spirit and alters hex.</p><p><b>Spirit Animal</b>: At 2nd level, an unsworn shaman's spirit animal gains the spirit animal bonus from one of her wandering spirits (see below). This bonus can be changed each day when the shaman prepares spells, but it must correspond to one of the shaman's wandering spirits. This ability alters spirit animal.</p><p><b>Spirit Magic (Sp)</b>: The unsworn shaman gains this ability at 2nd level rather than at 1st. This ability alters spirit magic.</p><p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, the unsworn shaman gains access to the wandering spirit class feature. At 10th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 18th level, she gains the abilities listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p><p>Additionally, at 6th level, she gains a second wandering spirit, gaining the abilities listed in the greater version of that spirit at 14th level, and the abilities listed in the true version at 20th level. This ability alters wandering spirit and replaces wandering hex.</p><h1>VISIONARY (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>The visionary is a master of divination, drawing upon her intimate relationship with the spirit world to ferret out all manner of secrets and insights about the world around her and beyond.</p><p><b>Bonus Feat</b>: At 4th level, the visionary gains Diviner's Delving(APG) as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.</p><p><b>Discern Magical Expertise (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, the visionary can determine what type of spellcasting expertise a creature possesses by studying the creature for 2 rounds with <i>detect magic</i>or any of the following spells: <i>detect chaos</i>, <i>detect evil</i>, <i>detect good</i>, or <i>detect law</i>(if the creature belongs to the alignment). This ability tells the visionary what bloodlines, domains, hexes, schools, and mysteries (if any) the creature possesses.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>A successful Will saving throw negates this effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 the shaman's level + her Wisdom modifier). A creature affected by this ability cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours. This ability functions through magical sensors, as with <i>clairaudience/clairvoyance</i>and <i>scrying</i>. This ability replaces the wandering spirit gained at 4th level.</p><p><b>Vision Spirit Magic</b>: At 4th level, the visionary adds the following spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic: <i>see alignment</i>(UC) (1st), <i>see invisibility</i>(2nd), <i>clairaudience/ clairvoyance</i>(3rd), <i>detect scrying</i>(4th), <i>prying eyes</i>(5th), <i>legend lore</i>(6th), <i>vision</i>(7th), <i>moment of prescience</i>(8th), and <i>foresight</i>(9th). This ability replaces the spirit magic spells gained from the shaman's wandering spirit.</p><p><b>Improved Divination (Su)</b>: At 6th level, the visionary becomes more adept at divination magic. When she casts the <i>augury</i>spell, her chance for an accurate answer is automatically the maximum of 90%. Likewise, when she casts <i>divination</i>, she has the maximum 90% chance of an accurate answer.</p><p>In addition, the visionary can prepare <i>scrying</i>as a 4th-level spell, and it requires only 1 minute to cast. The visionary also has a 10% chance per caster level to cast the spells listed in the <i>scrying</i>spell description, instead of 5% per caster level (to a maximum of 100%).</p><p>The visionary must still prepare these spells to receive these benefits. This ability replaces the wandering hex gained at 6th level.</p><p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su)</b>: At 12th level, the visionary forms a temporary bond with another spirit (other than the one she selected using her spirit class feature). This ability is identical to the 4th-level wandering spirit class feature. She adds the wandering spirit magic spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic, along with vision spirit magic and her original spirit. At 20th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. This ability replaces the greater version of wandering spirit gained at 12th level and the true version of wandering spirit gained at 20th level.</p><h1>WITCH DOCTOR (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>The witch doctor is a healer who specializes in afflictions of the soul. often misunderstood, she protects her tribe with healing powers, powerful defensive magic, and her own divine \"witchcraft.\"</p><p><b>Alignment</b>: A witch doctor can't be of an evil alignment. This alters the shaman's alignment.</p><p><b>Channel Energy (Su)</b>: At 4th level, the witch doctor can draw transcendental energies to her location, flooding it with positive energy as the cleric class feature. The witch doctor uses her shaman level - 3 as her effective cleric level, and can channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. This is a separate pool of channel energy that does not stack with the life spirit's channel spirit ability. This ability replaces the hexes gained at 4th and 12th levels.</p><p><b>Counter Curse (Su)</b>: At 8th level, the witch doctor can sacrifice any prepared spirit magic spell of 3rd level or higher in order to spontaneously cast <i>dispel magic</i>or <i>remove curse</i>. This ability can target only a spell effect that is on an ally (including herself ). If she sacrifices a spirit magic spell whose level exceeds 3rd, she gains a +2 sacred bonus on her caster level check to dispel the spell or to remove the curse for every level by which the spell sacrificed exceeds 3rd level. This ability replaces the hex gained at 8th level.</p><p><b>Countering Hex (Su)</b>: At 10th level, the witch doctor can use this hex to counterspell as a readied action as if using <i>dispel magic</i>. She must succeed at a dispel check (1d20 + her shaman level) with a DC equal to 11 + the spell's caster level. If she succeeds, the spell fizzles away and is lost. Failure means the spell is not countered. In either case, the witch doctor cannot attempt to use this hex against any of that caster's spells again for 24 hours. The witch doctor cannot use countering hex on an ongoing effect, a magic item, or a hex. This ability replaces the hex gained at 10th level.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"L3tUlEIFpBhdRtew"}

In truth, it's never so simple, and how a witch uses her magic is often tied to her personal history.</p><h1>HEX CHANNELER (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>A hex channeler is a witch who devotes herself either to life (healing the wounded and destroying the undead) or to death (slaying the living and aiding the undead).</p><p><b>Channel Energy (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, a hex channeler can call upon her patron to release a wave of energy from herself or her familiar. A good witch channels positive energy (like a good cleric), and an evil witch channels negative energy (like an evil cleric). A witch who is neither good nor evil must choose whether she channels positive or negative energy; once this choice is made, it cannot be changed.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either undead or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the witch. The witch can channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). This ability otherwise functions as a cleric using channel energy, except the witch does not need a holy symbol to use this ability. The hex channeler uses her witch level as her cleric level for all other effects dependent upon channel energy (except increasing the amount of damage healed or dealt). The hex channeler can choose whether or not to include herself or her familiar in this effect.</p><p>This burst heals or deals 1d6 points of damage. Whenever the hex channeler is able to learn a new hex (including major and grand hexes, but not hexes gained through the Extra Hex feat), she can instead increase her channel energy amount by 1d6.</p><p>This ability replaces the hex gained at 2nd level.</p><p><b>Hexes</b>: The following hexes complement the hex channeler archetype: blight(APG), healing(APG), poison steep(UM), and ward(APG).</p><p><b>Major Hexes</b>: The following major hexes complement the hex channeler archetype: agony(APG), cook people(UM), infected wounds(UM), major healing(APG), and retribution(APG).</p><p><b>Grand Hexes</b>: The following grand hexes complement the hex channeler archetype: death curse(APG), dire prophecy(UM), life giver(APG), and summon spirit(UM).</p><h1>MOUNTAIN WITCH (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Mountains can be sanctuaries for witches hunted by society. Here they form bonds with the spirits of the lofty reaches.</p><p><b>Spells</b>: A mountain witch replaces some of her patron spells with the following: 2nd-<i>magic stone</i>, 4th-<i>stone call</i>(APG), 6th- <i>meld into stone</i>, 8th-<i>stoneskin</i>, 10th-<i>wall of stone</i>, 12th-<i>stone tell</i>, 14th-<i>statue</i>, 16th-<i>repel metal or stone</i>, 18th-<i>clashing rocks</i>(APG).</p><p><b>Stone Spirit Hex</b>: A mountain witch can select hexes from the shaman's stone spirit (see page 44) as if they were witch hexes. She uses her witch level as her shaman level to determine the effect of the hex, and Intelligence instead of Wisdom to determine its DC. This ability alters hex.</p><p><b>Mountain Beast Empathy (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, a mountain witch can influence the attitude of mountain-dwelling animals, as the druid's wild empathy class feature but only on animals native to mountainous environments. The mountain witch uses her witch level as her druid level for this ability. This ability replaces the hex gained at 2nd level.</p><p><b>Hexes</b>: The following hexes complement the mountain witch archetype: beast of ill-omen(UM), crystal sight*, lodestone*, metal curse*, stone stability*, and ward of stone*.

Swashbucklers dart in and out of the fray, wearing down opponents with lunges and feints, all while foiling powerful attacks against themselves with a flick of the wrist and a flash of the blade. Their deft parries and fatal ripostes are carnage elevated to an art form. Some swashbucklers may be arrogant and devil-may-care, but behind this veneer lie people deeply dedicated to their craft. Those of smaller races are particularly driven to prove that the right mix of discipline and daring is the perfect counter to size and strength, and they enjoy nothing more than taking down lumbering brutes and bullies.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Role</b>: Combining fancy footwork with quick and precise lunges, swashbucklers dart in and out of battle, harassing and thwarting their opponents.

FEATURES</h1><p>The following are the class features of the swashbuckler.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: Swashbucklers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as light armor and bucklers.</p><p><b>Panache (Ex)</b>: More than just a lightly armored warrior, a swashbuckler is a daring combatant. She fights with panache: a fluctuating measure of a swashbuckler's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a swashbuckler gains a number of panache points equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Her panache goes up or down throughout the day, but usually can't exceed her Charisma modifier (minimum 1), though feats and magic items can affect this maximum. A swashbuckler spends panache points to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains panache in the following ways.</p><p><i>Critical Hit with a Light or One-Handed Piercing Melee Weapon</i>: Each time the swashbuckler confirms a critical hit with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, she regains 1 panache point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the swashbuckler's character level doesn't restore panache.</p><p><i>Killing Blow with a Light or One-Handed Piercing Melee Weapon</i>: When the swashbuckler reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon attack while in combat, she regains 1 panache point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the swashbuckler's character level to 0 or fewer hit points doesn't restore panache.</p><p><b>Deeds</b>: Swashbucklers spend panache points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the swashbuckler a momentary bonus or effect, but some provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds remain in effect while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, but do not require the expenditure of panache points to be maintained. A swashbuckler can perform deeds only of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the swashbuckler has or spends the required number of panache points to perform the deed.</p><p><i>Derring-Do (Ex)</i>: At 1st level, a swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point when she makes an Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Fly, Ride, or Swim check to roll 1d6 and add the result to the check. She can do this after she makes the check but before the result is revealed. If the result of the d6 roll is a natural 6, she rolls another 1d6 and adds it to the check. She can continue to do this as long as she rolls natural 6s, up to a number of times equal to her Dexterity modifier (minimum 1).</p><p><i>Dodging Panache (Ex)</i>: At 1st level, when an opponent attempts a melee attack against the swashbuckler, the swashbuckler can as an immediate action spend 1 panache point to move 5 feet; doing so grants the swashbuckler a dodge bonus to AC equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 0) against the triggering attack. This movement doesn't negate the attack, which is still resolved as if the swashbuckler had not moved from her previous square. This movement is not a 5-foot step; it provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures other than the one who triggered this deed. The swashbuckler can perform this deed only while wearing light armor or no armor, and while carrying no heavier than a light load.</p><p><i>Opportune Parry and Riposte (Ex)</i>: At 1st level, when an opponent makes a melee attack against the swashbuckler, she can spend 1 panache point and expend a use of an attack of opportunity to attempt to parry that attack. The swashbuckler makes an attack roll as if she were making an attack of opportunity; for each size category the attacking creature is larger than the swashbuckler, the swashbuckler takes a -2 penalty on this roll. If her result is greater than the attacking creature's result, the creature's attack automatically misses. The swashbuckler must declare the use of this ability after the creature's attack is announced, but before its attack roll is made. Upon performing a successful parry and if she has at least 1 panache point, the swashbuckler can as an immediate action make an attack against the creature whose attack she parried, provided that creature is within her reach. This deed's cost cannot be reduced by any ability or effect that reduces the number of panache points a deed costs.</p><p><i>Kip-Up (Ex)</i>: At 3rd level, while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she can stand up from prone as a move action without provoking an attack of opportunity. She can stand up from prone as a swift action instead by spending 1 panache point.</p><p><i>Menacing Swordplay (Ex)</i>: At 3rd level, while she has at least 1 panache point, when a swashbuckler hits an opponent with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, she can use Intimidate to demoralize that opponent (<i>Core Rulebook</i>99) as a swift action instead of a standard action.</p><p><i>Precise Strike (Ex)</i>: At 3rd level, while she has at least 1 panache point, a swashbuckler gains the ability to strike precisely with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon (though not a natural weapon), adding her swashbuckler level to the damage dealt. To use this deed, a swashbuckler cannot attack with a weapon in her off hand or use a shield other than a buckler. She can use this ability even with thrown light or one-handed piercing melee weapons, so long as the target is within 30 feet of her. Any creature that is immune to sneak attacks is immune to the additional damage granted by precise strike, and any item or ability that protects a creature from critical hits also protects a creature from the additional damage of a precise strike. This additional damage is precision damage, and isn't multiplied on a critical hit.</p><p>As a swift action, a swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point to double her precise strike's damage bonus on her next attack. This benefit must be used before the end of her turn, or it is lost. This deed's cost cannot be reduced by any ability or effect that reduces the amount of panache points a deed costs (such as the Signature Deed(UC) feat).</p><p><i>Swashbuckler Initiative (Ex)</i>: At 3rd level, while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. In addition, if she has the Quick Draw feat, her hands are free and unrestrained, and she has a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon that's unhidden and ready to draw, she can draw that weapon as part of the initiative check.</p><p><i>Swashbuckler's Grace (Ex)</i>: At 7th level, while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she takes no penalty for moving at full speed when she uses Acrobatics to attempt to move through a threatened area or an enemy's space.</p><p><i>Superior Feint (Ex)</i>: At 7th level, a swashbuckler with at least 1 panache point can, as a standard action, purposely miss a creature she could make a melee attack against with a wielded light or one-handed piercing melee weapon. When she does, the creature is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC until the start of the swashbuckler's next turn.</p><p><i>Targeted Strike (Ex)</i>: At 7th level, as a full-round action, the swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point to make an attack with a single light or one-handed piercing melee weapon that cripples part of a foe's body. The swashbuckler chooses a part of the body to target. If the attack succeeds, in addition to the attack's normal damage, the target suffers one of the following effects based on the part of the body targeted (see below).</p><p>If a creature doesn't have one of these body locations, that body part cannot be targeted. Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to targeted strikes. Items or abilities that protect a creature from critical hits also protect a creature from targeted strikes.</p><list><p><li><i>Arms</i>: The target takes no damage from the attack, but it drops one carried item of the swashbuckler's choice, even if the item is wielded with two hands. Items held in a locked gauntlet cannot be chosen.</li><li><i>Head</i>: The target is confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect.</li><li><i>Legs</i>: The target is knocked prone. Creatures with four or more legs or that are immune to trip attacks are immune to this effect.</li><li><i>Torso or Wings</i>: The target is staggered for 1 round.</li></p></list><p><i>Bleeding Wound (Ex)</i>: At 11th level, when the swashbuckler hits a living creature with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, as a free action she can spend 1 panache point to have that attack deal additional bleed damage. The amount of bleed damage dealt is equal to the swashbuckler's Dexterity modifier (minimum 1). Alternatively, the swashbuckler can spend 2 panache points to deal 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution bleed damage instead (swashbuckler's choice). Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to these types of bleed damage.</p><p><i>Evasive (Ex)</i>: At 11th level, while a swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she gains the benefits of the evasion, uncanny dodge, and improved uncanny dodge rogue class features. She uses her swashbuckler level as her rogue level for improved uncanny dodge.</p><p><i>Subtle Blade (Ex)</i>: At 11th level, while a swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she is immune to disarm, steal, and sunder combat maneuvers made against a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon she is wielding.</p><p><i>Dizzying Defense (Ex)</i>: At 15th level, while wielding a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon in one hand, the swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point to take the fighting defensively action as a swift action instead of a standard action. When she fights defensively in this manner, the dodge bonus to AC gained from that action increases to +4, and the penalty to attack rolls is reduced to -2.</p><p><i>Perfect Thrust (Ex)</i>: At 15th level, while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she can make a perfect thrust, pooling all of her attack potential into a single melee attack as a full-round action made with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon. When she does, she makes the attack against the target's touch AC and ignores all damage reduction possessed by the target.</p><p><i>Swashbuckler's Edge (Ex)</i>: At 15th level, while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she can take 10 on any Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Fly, Ride, or Swim check, even while distracted or in immediate danger. She can use this ability in conjunction with the derring-do deed.</p><p><i>Cheat Death (Ex)</i>: At 19th level, while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, when she is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, she can spend all of her remaining panache points to instead be reduced to 1 hit point. Effects that kill the swashbuckler outright without dealing hit point damage are not affected by this ability.</p><p><i>Deadly Stab (Ex)</i>: At 19th level, when the swashbuckler confirms a critical hit with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, in addition to the normal damage, she can spend 1 panache point to inflict a deadly stab. The target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or die. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the swashbuckler's level + the swashbuckler's Dexterity modifier. This is a death attack. Performing this deed does not restore panache to the swashbuckler.</p><p><i>Stunning Stab (Ex)</i>: At 19th level, when a swashbuckler hits a creature with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, she can spend 2 panache points to stun the creature for 1 round. The creature must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the swashbuckler's level + the swashbuckler's Dexterity modifier) or be stunned for 1 round. Creatures that are immune to critical hits are also immune to this effect.</p><p><b>Swashbuckler Finesse (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a swashbuckler gains the benefit of the Weapon Finesse feat with light or one-handed piercing melee weapons, and she can use her Charisma score in place of her Intelligence score as a prerequisite for combat feats. This ability counts as having the Weapon Finesse feat for purpose of meeting feat prerequisites.</p><p><b>Charmed Life (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, the swashbuckler gains a knack for getting out of trouble. Three times per day as an immediate action, she can add her Charisma modifier to the result of a saving throw. She must choose to do this before the roll is made. At 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the number of times she can do this per day increases by one (to a maximum of seven times per day at 18th level).</p><p><b>Nimble (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, a swashbuckler gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light armor or no armor. Anything that causes the swashbuckler to lose her Dexterity bonus to AC also causes her to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of +5 at 19th level).</p><p><b>Bonus Feats</b>: At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a swashbuckler gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those categorized as combat feats. Swashbuckler levels are considered fighter levels for the purpose of meeting combat feat prerequisites.</p><p>In addition, upon reaching 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a swashbuckler can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat she has already learned. In effect, the swashbuckler loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A swashbuckler can change only one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p><p><b>Swashbuckler Weapon Training (Ex)</b>: At 5th level, a swashbuckler gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one-handed or light piercing melee weapons. While wielding such a weapon, she gains the benefit of the Improved Critical feat. These attack and damage bonuses increase by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 5th (to a maximum of +4 at 17th level).</p><p><b>Swashbuckler Weapon Mastery (Ex)</b>: At 20th level, when a swashbuckler threatens a critical hit with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, that critical hit is automatically confirmed. Furthermore, the critical multipliers of such weapons increase by 1 (2 becomes 3, and so on).</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Grit and Panache</h1><p>The gunslinger's grit and the swashbuckler's panache represent two paths to gain access to the same heroic pool. Characters with both grit and panache class features combine the two resources into a larger pool of both grit points and panache points.</p><p>For the purposes of feat prerequisites, a character with the panache class feature satisfies the prerequisites as if she were a grit user, and vice versa. Swashbuckler levels stack with gunslinger levels for the purpose of satisfying Signature Deed's level requirement. For feats, magic items, and other effects, a panache user can spend and gain panache points in place of grit points, and vice versa.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1classes\">^Classes</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">Archetypes and Class Options</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"LveqrD76PnPoBIgp"}

<text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>CLASS FEATURES</h1><p>The following are the class features of the hunter.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: A hunter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p><p><b>Spells</b>: A hunter casts divine spells drawn from the druid and ranger spell lists (see Chapter 10 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>). Only druid spells of 6th level and lower and ranger spells are considered to be part of the hunter spell list. If a spell appears on both the druid and ranger spell lists, the hunter uses the lower of the two spell levels given for the spell. For instance, <i>reduce animal</i>is a 2nd-level druid spell and a 3rd-level ranger spell, making it a 2nd-level hunter spell. Likewise, <i>detect poison</i>is a 0-level druid spell and a 2nd-level ranger spell, making it a 0-level hunter spell.</p><p>The hunter can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a hunter must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell's level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a hunter's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the hunter's Wisdom modifier.</p><p>A hunter cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of druid spells of 7th level or higher. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells below.</p><p>Like other spellcasters, a hunter can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Hunter. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 on page 17 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>).</p><p>Unlike druids and rangers, a hunter's selection of spells is extremely limited. A hunter begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new hunter level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hunter knows is not affected by her Wisdom score; the numbers on Table 1-7 are fixed.</p><p>In addition to the spells gained by hunters as they gain levels, each hunter also automatically adds all <i>summon nature's ally</i>spells to her list of spells known. These spells are added as soon as the hunter is capable of casting them.</p><p>At 5th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, a hunter can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the hunter loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A hunter may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any <i>summon nature's ally</i>spells.</p><p>Unlike a druid or a ranger, a hunter need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.</p><p><b>Orisons</b>: Hunters learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-7: Hunter Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p><p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells</b>: A hunter can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p><p><b>Animal Companion (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a hunter forms a bond with an animal companion. A hunter begins play with any one of the animals available to a druid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the hunter on her adventures. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature). The hunter's effective druid level is equal to her hunter level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purpose of determining the companion's statistics and abilities. A hunter may teach her companion hunter's tricks from the skirmisher ranger archetype (<i>Advanced Player's Guide</i>128) instead of standard tricks. The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to 1/2 its hit dice + its Wisdom modifier.</p><p>If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter's animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a <i>summon nature's ally</i>spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level. A hunter cannot have more than one <i>summon nature's ally</i>spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing <i>summon nature's ally</i>effect immediately ends.</p><p><b>Animal Focus (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a hunter can apply the aspect of an animal to herself as a swift action. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or a special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level. The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. Normally, the hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.</p><p>The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter's minutes of duration per day-it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion's aspect can be the same aspect the ranger has taken on, or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal aspects on both herself and her animal companion as part of the same swift action.</p><p>If the hunter's animal companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion's animal aspect to herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal animal aspect she can choose, and (as with a companion's focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day.</p><p><i>Bat</i>: The creature gains darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. At 8th level, the range increases by 30 feet. At 15th level, the creature also gains blindsense with a range of 10 feet.</p><p><i>Bear</i>: The creature gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.</p><p><i>Bull</i>: The creature gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.</p><p><i>Falcon</i>: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Perception checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p><p><i>Frog</i>: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Swim checks and on Acrobatics checks to jump. These bonuses increase to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p><p><i>Monkey</i>: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Climb checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p><p><i>Mouse</i>: The creature gains evasion, as the rogue class feature. At 12th level, this benefit becomes improved evasion, as the rogue advanced talent.</p><p><i>Owl</i>: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Stealth checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p><p><i>Snake</i>: The creature gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls when making attacks of opportunity and a +2 dodge bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity. These bonuses increase to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.</p><p><i>Stag</i>: The creature gains a 5-foot enhancement bonus to its base land speed. This bonus increases to 10 feet at 8th level and 20 feet at 15th level.</p><p><i>Tiger</i>: The creature gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.</p><p><i>Wolf</i>: The creature gains the scent ability with a range of 10 feet. The range of this sense increases to 20 feet at 8th level and 30 feet at 15th level. The range doubles if the opponent is upwind, and is halved if the opponent is downwind.</p><p><b>Nature Training (Ex)</b>: A hunter counts her total hunter level as both druid levels and ranger levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats, traits, and options that modify or improve an animal companion.</p><p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex)</b>: A hunter can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>). The hunter rolls 1d20 and adds her hunter level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p><p>To use wild empathy, the hunter and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p><p>The hunter can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p><p><b>Precise Companion (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, a hunter chooses either Precise Shot or Outflank(APG) as a bonus feat. She does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat. If she chooses Outflank, she automatically grants this feat to her animal companion as well.</p><p><b>Track (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, a hunter adds 1/2 her level to Survival checks made to follow tracks.</p><p><b>Hunter Tactics (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, the hunter automatically grants her teamwork feats to her animal companion. The companion doesn't need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats.</p><p><b>Teamwork Feat</b>: At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, the hunter gains a bonus teamwork feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. The hunter must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus teamwork feat.</p><p>As a standard action, the hunter can learn a new bonus teamwork feat in place of the most recent bonus teamwork feat she had already learned. In effect, the hunter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. She can change only the most recent teamwork feat gained, and must meet the prerequisites for the newly selected feat. A hunter can change her most recent teamwork feat a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Whenever she gains a new teamwork feat, her previous teamwork feats become permanent.</p><p><b>Improved Empathic Link (Su)</b>: At 4th level, the hunter gains an empathic link with her animal companion. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the hunter can also see through a companion's eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The hunter is blinded while maintaining this connection.</p><p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex)</b>: At 5th level, a hunter and her animal companion may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at their normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p><p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion will still affect the hunter and her animal companion.</p><p><b>Bonus Tricks (Ex)</b>: At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, a hunter's animal companion learns a bonus trick (in addition to the bonus tricks gained from the hunter's effective druid level).</p><p><b>Second Animal Focus (Su)</b>: At 8th level, whenever a hunter uses her animal focus ability, she selects two animal aspects for herself instead of one, and can apply two aspects to her companion instead of one. As with the companion's previous aspect, the second one does not count against the minutes per day a hunter can take on an aspect.</p><p>If the hunter's animal companion is dead and the hunter has applied the companion's animal aspect to herself, that aspect does not count toward her maximum of two aspects at once. The hunter can still apply only one of her dead companion's aspects to herself, not both.</p><p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex)</b>: At 8th level, a hunter can move at her normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. She takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p><p><b>Raise Animal Companion (Sp)</b>: At 10th level, a hunter gains <i>raise animal companion</i>(UM) as a spell-like ability. Using this spell-like ability gives the hunter a permanent negative level. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by <i>restoration</i>), but automatically ends after 24 hours. At 16th level, this ability functions as <i>resurrection</i>instead of <i>raise dead</i>, but otherwise operates as normal.</p><p><b>Speak with Master (Ex)</b>: At 11th level, a hunter and her animal companion can communicate verbally, as if they were using a common language. Other creatures cannot understand the communication without magical aid.</p><p><b>Greater Empathic Link (Su)</b>: At 14th level, the range of the hunter's empathic link with her animal companion increases to 10 miles. If the animal companion is within 1 mile, the hunter can communicate with it telepathically.</p><p><b>One with the Wild (Ex)</b>: At 17th level, the hunter and her animal companion are respected or even feared by other animals, so long as the animals are approximately of the same type as any of the hunter's current animal foci: bat for bats, tiger for felines, falcon for birds, snake for reptiles, and so on. No animal in this category (including dire varieties) willingly attacks the hunter or her companion unless magically compelled to do so or if the hunter or companion attacks it first.</p><p>The hunter and her companion can attempt to demoralize animals in the appropriate category as a swift action, rolling 1d20 and adding the hunter's level and her Charisma modifier to determine the Intimidate check result.</p><p><b>Master Hunter (Ex)</b>: At 20th level, a hunter becomes a master hunter, able to track down foes with ease. She can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty.</p><p>Additionally, each day when the hunter regains her spell slots, she chooses one animal focus to be active on herself for the entire day. This focus is in addition to using her animal focus class ability (including the additional focus she is able to use on herself if her animal companion is dead).</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1classes\">^Classes</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">Archetypes and Class Options</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"MLzCedtxoK3pAKMQ"}

Investigators are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword cane(UE). They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p><p><b>Alchemy (Su)</b>: Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potionlike extracts.</p><p>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using <i>detect magic</i>. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.</p><p>Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by <i>dispel magic</i>and similar effects, using the investigator's level as the caster level.</p><p>An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table 1-8: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.</p><p>When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator's possession, then reactivates as soon as it returns to his keeping-an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must prepare his extracts anew every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.</p><p>Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant-comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.</p><p>An investigator uses the alchemist formula list (<i>Advanced Player's Guide</i>32) to determine the extracts that he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the extract's level. The saving throw DC of an investigator's extract is equal to 10 + the extract's level + the investigator's Intelligence modifier.</p><p>An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1st-level formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modifier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula of any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just as a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard's spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator's or an alchemist's formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying formulae.</p><p><b>Inspiration (Ex)</b>: An investigator is beyond knowledgeable and skilled-he also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An investigator typically uses these powers to aid in his investigations, but can also use these flashes of inspiration in other situations.</p><p>An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator's inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night's sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 (his inspiration die) to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or takes 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the result is revealed. An investigator can use inspiration once only per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he's trained in the skill.</p><p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator's pool. In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather than a free action.</p><p><b>Trapfinding</b>: An investigator adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) to Perception checks made to locate traps and to Disable Device checks. An investigator can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps.</p><p><b>Poison Lore (Ex)</b>: An investigator has a deep understanding of and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, he cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon. If the investigator spends 1 minute physically examining a poison, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural poison or a Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison's saving throw DC). Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the poison's saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.</p><p><b>Poison Resistance (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, an investigator gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against poison.</p><p>This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level and to +6 at 8th level. At 11th level, the investigator gains immunity to poison.</p><p><b>Investigator Talent (Ex or Su)</b>: At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can be selected only once.</p><p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk * add effects to an investigator's studied combat or studied strike. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.</p><p><i>Alchemist Discovery (Ex)</i>: The investigator can select one of the following alchemist discoveries as an investigator talent: combine extracts, concentrate poison, dilution, elixir of life, enhance potion, eternal potion, extend potion, infusion, mutagen(UM), and poison conversion(UC). When selecting an alchemist discovery, he must be of a high enough level to qualify for that discovery, using his investigator level as his alchemist level to determine if he qualifies. This talent can be selected multiple times; each time grants a new alchemist discovery.</p><p><i>Amazing Inspiration (Ex)</i>: The investigator rolls a d8 as his inspiration die instead of a d6. If he has the true inspiration ability, he rolls 2d8 and adds both dice to the result. An investigator must be at least 7th level to select this talent.</p><p><i>Blinding Strike</i>* <i>(Ex)</i>: When the investigator deals damage with studied strike, the opponent must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be permanently blinded. A successful saving throw reduces this effect to dazzled for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the investigator's level + his Intelligence modifier. This talent has no effect on creatures that do not rely on eyes for sight or creatures with more than two eyes (although multiple critical hits might cause blindness, at the GM's discretion). Blindness can be cured by <i>heal, regeneration, remove blindness,</i>or similar abilities. An investigator must be at least 17th level to select this talent.</p><p><i>Combat Inspiration (Ex)</i>: When an investigator uses inspiration on an attack roll or a saving throw, he expends one use of inspiration instead of two. An investigator must be at least 9th level to select this talent.</p><p><i>Confusing Strike</i>* <i>(Ex)</i>: When the investigator deals damage with studied strike, the opponent must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or become confused for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful saving throw reduces the duration to 1 round. The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the investigator's level + his Intelligence modifier. Constructs, mindless creatures, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits are not affected by this ability. An investigator must be at least 19th level to select this talent.</p><p><i>Deafening Strike</i>* <i>(Ex)</i>: When an investigator deals damage with studied strike, the opponent must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be permanently deafened. A successful Fortitude saving throw reduces the duration of this effect to 1 round. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the investigator's level + his Intelligence modifier. This talent has no effect on deaf creatures. Deafness can be cured by <i>heal</i>, <i>regeneration</i>, <i>remove blindness</i>, or similar effects. An investigator must be at least 15th level to select this talent.</p><p><i>Device Talent (Ex)</i>: The investigator can use the Use Magic Device skill even if he's not trained in that skill. If the investigator is trained in Use Magic Device, he can use inspiration on any Use Magic Device checks without expending uses of inspiration.</p><p><i>Effortless Aid (Ex)</i>: The investigator can use an aid another action as a move action instead of as a standard action. An investigator can expend one use of inspiration to instead perform an aid another action as a swift action.</p><p><i>Eidetic Recollection (Su)</i>: An investigator can always take 10 on any of his Knowledge checks, even if he's in immediate danger or distracted. An investigator can expend one use of inspiration to take 20 on a Knowledge check, even if he's in immediate danger or distracted. An investigator must be at least 11th level to select this talent.</p><p><i>Empathy (Ex, Su)</i>: When attempting a Sense Motive check, the investigator makes two d20 rolls and takes the higher result. If an investigator uses inspiration on a Sense Motive check, he rolls his inspiration die twice and takes the higher result. Once per day, the investigator can expend one use of inspiration to target a single creature that he can see and hear within 30 feet. Upon doing so, the investigator detects the surface thoughts of the target's mind, as if he concentrated for 3 rounds while using the <i>detect thoughts</i>spell, unless the creature succeeds at a Will saving throw. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the investigator's level + his Intelligence modifier. If the target fails, the investigator can continue to detect the surface thoughts of the target creature for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 his investigator level. An investigator must be at least 5th level to select this talent.</p><p><i>Expanded Inspiration (Ex)</i>: An investigator can use inspiration on any Diplomacy, Heal, Perception, Profession, or Sense Motive checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he's trained in the skill.</p><p><i>Greater Combat Inspiration (Ex)</i>: Choose a single weapon type (such as sword cane(UE) or short sword). As long as the investigator has at least one use of inspiration in his inspiration pool, he no longer has to expend a use of inspiration to use inspiration on attacks made with this weapon. An investigator must have the combat inspiration investigator talent and be at least 19th level to select this talent.</p><p><i>Hidden Agendas (Ex)</i>: An investigator learns to obscure his thoughts and endeavors from prying eyes and even intrusive magic. When an investigator uses inspiration on a Bluff check to pass secret messages or on a Linguistics check to create forgeries, he can roll his inspiration die twice and take the higher result. In addition, the investigator can use inspiration on a saving throw against a divination spell or effect without expending a use of inspiration. An investigator must be at least 11th level to select this talent.</p><p><i>Inspirational Expertise (Ex):</i>When an investigator succeeds at a Knowledge check to identify a monster's special powers or vulnerabilities, he can expend one use of inspiration as a swift action to grant allies within 30 feet that can hear him a +4 insight bonus on attack rolls against that monster or type of monster for 1 round. An investigator must be at least 7th level to select this talent.</p><p><i>Inspired Alertness (Ex)</i>: Whenever the investigator becomes flat-footed, he can expend one use of inspiration to ignore that condition. He must be conscious to do so, and must decide to do so when he becomes flat-footed. Using this ability doesn't require an action.</p><p><i>Inspired Intelligence (Ex)</i>: An investigator can use inspiration on any all Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft checks without expending a use of inspiration, even if he's not trained in that skill.</p><p><i>Inspired Intimidator (Ex)</i>: When the investigator succeeds at an Intimidate check to demoralize an opponent, he can expend one use of inspiration to automatically increase the result of the check by 5 for the purpose of determining the duration of the demoralize effect. He can choose to spend multiple uses of inspiration in this manner to further increase the duration of the demoralize effect. An investigator must be trained in Intimidate to select this talent. The underworld inspiration investigator talent has no effect on this talent.</p><p><i>Item Lore (Ex)</i>: An investigator can use Spellcraft to identify the properties and command words of magic items without needing to use <i>detect magic</i>or similar spells. An investigator must be at least 7th level to select this talent.</p><p><i>Perceptive Tracking (Ex)</i>: The investigator can use Perception instead of Survival to both find and follow tracks, using the same DCs given for the Survival skill (<i>Core Rulebook</i>107). An investigator must be trained in Perception to select this talent.</p><p><i>Quick Study (Ex)</i>: An investigator can use studied combat as a swift action instead of a move action.</p><p><i>Repositioning Strike</i>* <i>(Ex)</i>: When the investigator deals damage with studied strike, he can perform a reposition(APG) combat maneuver as a free action against the creature damaged by studied strike. This reposition does not provoke attacks of opportunity. An investigator must be at least 13th level to select this talent.</p><p><i>Rogue Talent (Ex)</i>: An investigator can select one of the following rogue talents in place of an investigator talent: assault leader(APG), black market connections(UC), camouflage(APG), canny observer(APG), charmer(APG), coax information(APG), combat swipe(APG), convincing liar(UC), cunning trigger(APG), deft palm(UC), expert leaper(APG), fast fingers(APG), fast getaway(APG), fast picks(APG), fast stealth, firearm training(UC), guileful polyglot(APG), grit(UC), hard to fool(APG), hold breath(UC), honeyed words(APG), iron guts(UC), lasting poison(APG), ledge walker, major magic, minor magic, nimble climber(APG), peerless maneuver(APG), quick disable, quick disguise(APG), quick trapsmith(APG), resilience, rogue crawl, rope master(UC), stand up, strong stroke(UC), terrain master(UC), trap spotter, or wall scrambler(UC). Any talent effects based on rogue level use the investigator's class level. If the rogue talent has a prerequisite (such as the major magic rogue talent requiring the minor magic talent), the investigator must meet the prerequisite before selecting that rogue talent. This talent can be selected multiple times; each time, it grants the investigator a new rogue talent.</p><p><i>Sapping offensive</i>* <i>(Ex)</i>: When the investigator damages a target of his studied combat, that creature cannot make attacks of opportunity for 1 round. An investigator must be at least 5th level to select this talent.</p><p><i>Sickening offensive</i>* <i>(Ex)</i>: When the investigator damages a target of his studied combat, that creature is also sickened for 1 round. An investigator must be at least 7th level to select this talent.</p><p><i>Stealing Strike</i>* <i>(Ex)</i>: When the investigator deals damage with studied strike, he can perform a steal(APG) combat maneuver as a free action against the creature damaged by studied strike. This steal does not provoke attacks of opportunity. An investigator must be at least 13th level to select this talent.</p><p><i>Studied Defense (Ex)</i>: When an investigator with this talent uses studied combat, he can apply that ability's insight bonus to his AC against attacks made by the target of his studied combat instead of to his attack rolls against the target of his studied combat. (The insight bonus on damage rolls remains.) He must choose which type of bonus he gains when using studied combat, and it cannot be changed until he uses studied combat again. An investigator must be at least 9th level to select this talent.</p><p><i>Tenacious Inspiration (Ex)</i>: When an investigator rolls his inspiration die, he can roll twice and take the higher result. An investigator must be at least 13th level to select this talent.</p><p><i>Toppling Strike</i>* (Ex): When the investigator deals damage with studied strike, he can perform a trip combat maneuver as a free action against the creature damaged by studied strike. This trip does not provoke attacks of opportunity. An investigator must be at least 9th level to select this talent.</p><p><i>Unconventional Inspiration (Ex)</i>: An investigator with this talent can pick any one skill. He can add his inspiration die to checks attempted with that skill without expending a use of inspiration.</p><p><i>Underworld Inspiration (Ex)</i>: An investigator can use inspiration on Bluff, Disable Device, Disguise, Intimidate, or Sleight of Hand checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he's trained in the skill.</p><p><b>Keen Recollection</b>: At 3rd level, an investigator can attempt all Knowledge checks untrained.</p><p><b>Trap Sense (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, an investigator gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, granting him a +1 bonus on Reflex saving throws to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).</p><p><b>Studied Combat (Ex)</b>: With a keen eye and a calculating mind, an investigator can assess the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p><p>An investigator can have only one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator's studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator's studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.</p><p><b>Studied Strike (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, upon successfully hitting his studied target with a melee attack, an investigator can make a studied strike as a free action against that target to deal additional damage. The additional damage is 1d6 at 4th level and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.</p><p>If the investigator's attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, a whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to have an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual -4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.</p><p>The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike against a creature with concealment.</p><p><b>Swift Alchemy (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, an investigator can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an investigator half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items. He can also apply poison to a weapon as a move action instead of a standard action.</p><p><b>True Inspiration (Ex)</b>: At 20th level, an investigator can use inspiration on all skill checks-even for skills in which he isn't trained-and on all ability checks without spending a use of inspiration.</p><p>In addition, whenever he uses inspiration on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can affect this. If the investigator has the amazing inspiration investigator talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If the investigator uses this ability with empathy, tenacious inspiration, or a similar talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the higher of the two results.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1classes\">^Classes</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">Archetypes and Class Options</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"Ngay5bm0rcO3sesv"}

The ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if it hadn't been used. In addition, twice per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become vulnerable to fire until the end of the wearer's turn. Whenever the creature takes fire damage, it takes half again as much damage (+50%). If the creature is already vulnerable to fire, this hex has no effect. Fire immunity and resistances apply as normal, and any saving throw allowed by the effect that caused the damage reduces the damage as normal.

In addition, as a standard action the wearer can cause one enemy within 30 feet to treat the light level as two steps lower: bright light becomes dim light, normal light becomes darkness, and areas of dim light and darkness become supernaturally dark (like darkness, but even creatures with darkvision can't see).

This ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if it isn't used. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become slightly magnetic; this effect lasts for 2 rounds.

The mist dissipates after it causes two attacks to miss because of concealment or after 1 minute, whichever comes first. In addition, as a swift action once per day the wearer can cause one creature within 30 feet to become more susceptible to the sapping powers of cold for 1 minute. When a creature takes cold damage while under this effect, it is entangled for 1 round.

In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to spark and shimmer with electrical energy for 4 rounds. While this effect doesn't harm the creature, it does cause the creature to emit light like a torch, preventing it from gaining any benefit from concealment or invisibility. Furthermore, while the aura lasts, whenever the target is hit with a metal melee weapon, it also takes 5 points of electricity damage.

When the troll is slain or the item's duration ends, it turns back into a bone that then crumbles into dust.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><tr><td>CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS</td></tr><p><b>COST</b> 1,200 GP</p><p>Craft Wondrous Item, <i>summon monster IV</i></p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>VANISHING SHEATH</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>PRICE</b>5,000 GP <b>SLOT</b> wrist<b> CL</b>6th <b>WEIGHT</b>1 lb.</p><p><b>AURA</b>moderate conjuration</p><p>This small sheath attaches to the wrist with a leather strap.

Racial favored class options were introduced in the <i>Advanced Player's Guide</i>, and expanded upon in the <i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide</i>, which covers the base classes from the <i>Core Rulebook</i>, the <i>Advanced Player's Guide</i>, <i>Ultimate Combat</i>, and <i>Ultimate Magic</i>.</p><p>Each of these rewards replaces the normal reward for having a level in a favored class (gaining 1 extra hit point or 1 extra skill rank). Unlike those general rewards, these alternate favored class options speak directly to the features of specific classes and the general tendencies of various races.</p><p>Whenever you gain a level, you can choose which favored class option you take. Unless otherwise noted, these benefits always stack with themselves.</p><p>Many of these alternate class rewards add only 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, or 1/6 to a roll (rather than 1) each time the reward is selected, or add 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, or 1/6 to a class ability (such as a bloodrager's number of bloodrages per day or a swashbuckler's total number of panache points). When applying such a benefit to a die roll or a class ability, always round down (minimum 0). You might thus need to select such an option several times before the benefit applies.</p><p>Some options have a fixed numerical limit, after which selecting such a favored class reward again has no effect. In these cases, you can always select from among the standard rewards when taking a level in a favored class (gaining 1 extra hit point or 1 extra skill rank).</p><h1>DWARVES</h1><p>Dwarves' hardiness and stalwart resolve make them particularly well suited to the martial classes, but those who imagine them to be bereft of magic quickly learn the error of their ways. The following options are available to all dwarves who have the indicated favored class.</p><p><b>Arcanist</b>: Add 1/4 to the arcanist's effective class level when determining the effects of the arcane barrier and arcane weapon arcanist exploits.</p><p><b>Bloodrager</b>: Increase the bloodrager's total number of bloodrage rounds per day by 1.</p><p><b>Brawler</b>: Reduce the hardness of any object made from clay, stone, or metal by 1 (minimum 0) whenever the object is struck by the brawler's unarmed strike.</p><p><b>Hunter</b>: Gain a +1/2 bonus on wild empathy checks the hunter makes to influence animals and magical beasts that live underground.</p><p><b>Investigator</b>: Gain a +1/4 bonus on Perception checks when underground and a +1/2 bonus to the investigator's trap sense ability regarding stone traps.</p><p><b>Shaman</b>: Add 1/4 to the natural armor bonus of the shaman's spirit animal.</p><p><b>Skald</b>: Reduce the arcane spell failure chance for casting skald spells when wearing heavy armor by 1%. Once this reduction reaches 10%, the skald also receives Heavy Armor Proficiency (if the skald does not already possess it).</p><p><b>Slayer</b>: Gain a +1/3 bonus on Knowledge (dungeoneering) checks and on Survival checks when underground. If the slayer has at least a +1 bonus on Knowledge (dungeoneering) checks from this ability, he is also considered trained in that skill.</p><p><b>Swashbuckler</b>: Add 1/4 to the swashbuckler's effective class level to determine the extra damage she deals because of the precise strike deed when wielding a light pick or a heavy pick. If the swashbuckler has the Slashing Grace feat or another similar effect, she can treat the battleaxe or the handaxe as a one-handed piercing melee weapon, and she gains this benefit when wielding the appropriate weapon for the feat as well.</p><p><b>Warpriest</b>: Add 1/3 to the number of times per day the warpriest can use blessings, but these additional uses must be of blessings that affect weapons or armor.</p><h1>ELVES</h1><p>Elves' grace and intellect lends itself to many classes. The following options are available to all elves who have the indicated favored class.</p><p><b>Arcanist</b>: Increase the maximum number of points in the arcanist's arcane reservoir by 1.</p><p><b>Bloodrager</b>: Add 1 foot to the bloodrager's base speed. In combat, this benefit has an effect only after every five such increases in base speed. This bonus stacks with the bloodrager's fast movement class feature, and applies under the same conditions as that feature.</p><p><b>Brawler</b>: Add 1 foot to the brawler's base speed. In combat, this benefit has an effect only after every five such increases in the brawler's base speed.</p><p><b>Hunter</b>: Choose a weapon from the following list: longbow, longsword, rapier, short sword, shortbow, or any weapon with \"elven\" in its name. Gain a +1/2 bonus on critical hit confirmation rolls made while using that type of weapon (maximum bonus +4). This bonus does not stack with those gained through Critical Focus and similar effects.</p><p><b>Investigator</b>: Increase the number of points in the investigator's inspiration pool by 1/3.</p><p><b>Shaman</b>: Add 5 feet to the range of a chosen shaman hex. Multiple bonuses from this ability can apply to the same hex, to a maximum of an additional 30 feet for any single hex.</p><p><b>Skald</b>: Increase the bonus granted by the well-versed class feature by 1/4 (maximum bonus +8).</p><p><b>Slayer</b>: Increase the studied target bonus on Perception and Survival checks by 1/4. When the slayer gains the stalker class feature, he also gains this increase to his studied target bonus on Stealth checks.</p><p><b>Swashbuckler</b>: Increase the total number of points in the swashbuckler's panache pool by 1/4.</p><p><b>Warpriest</b>: Add 1/2 to the number of times per day the warpriest can use blessings, but these additional uses can be from only the Air, Animal, Charm, Magic, Plant, and Sun blessings.</p><h1>GNOMES</h1><p>Gnomes' natural curiosity leads them to fling themselves into whatever pursuit they choose, often taking practices in bold new directions. The following options are available to all gnomes who have the indicated favored class.</p><p><b>Arcanist</b>: Add 1/6 to the number of points the arcanist gains in her arcane reservoir each day.</p><p><b>Bloodrager</b>: Add 1/4 to the bloodrager's effective class level when determining the strength of her bloodrager bloodline powers.</p><p><b>Brawler</b>: Increase the number of times per day the brawler can use martial flexibility by 1/4.</p><p><b>Hunter</b>: Add DR 1/magic to the hunter's animal companion. Each time the hunter gains another level, the DR increases by 1/2 (maximum DR 10/magic). If the hunter replaces her animal companion, the new companion gains this damage reduction.</p><p><b>Investigator</b>: Add one extract formula from the investigator's list to his formula book. This formula must be at least 1 level lower than the highest level of formula the investigator can create.</p><p><b>Shaman</b>: The shaman gains 1/6 of a new shaman hex.</p><p><b>Skald</b>: Add a +1 bonus on concentration checks when casting skald spells.</p><p><b>Slayer</b>: The slayer gains 1/6 of a new slayer talent.</p><p><b>Swashbuckler</b>: Increase the number of times per day the swashbuckler can use charmed life by 1/4.</p><p><b>Warpriest</b>: Add 1/2 to the result of the warpriest's channeled energy when healing creatures of the animal, fey, and plant types.</p><h1>HALF-ELVES</h1><p>Half-elves blend the strengths of both their heritages, making them unusually versatile. The following options are available to all half-elves who have the indicated favored class.</p><p><b>Arcanist</b>: When casting arcanist enchantment spells, add 1/3 to the effective caster level, but only for the purpose of determining duration.</p><p><b>Bloodrager</b>: Increase the bonus gained from blood sanctuary by 1/4.</p><p><b>Brawler</b>: Add 1 to the brawler's CMD when she's resisting a trip or overrun combat maneuver.</p><p><b>Hunter</b>: Add 1 foot to the hunter's companion's base speed. In combat, this benefit has an effect only after every five such increases in base speed. If the hunter replaces her animal companion, the new companion gains this benefit.</p><p><b>Investigator</b>: Gain a +1/4 bonus on inspiration die rolls.</p><p><b>Shaman</b>: Add one spell from the cleric spell list that isn't on the shaman spell list to the list of spells the shaman knows. This spell must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell the shaman can cast.</p><p><b>Skald</b>: Increase the skald's total number of raging song rounds per day by 1.</p><p><b>Slayer</b>: Gain a +1/2 bonus on Bluff checks to feint and on Diplomacy checks to gain information.</p><p><b>Swashbuckler</b>: Increase the number of times per day the swashbuckler can use charmed life by 1/4.</p><p><b>Warpriest</b>: Gain a +1/3 bonus on the damage dealt or healed with the warpriest's channel energy ability.</p><h1>HALFLINGS</h1><p>Half lings' ability to coexist with other races's societies makes them supremely adaptable and open to new ways of seeing the world or practicing the arts of magic and combat. The following options are available to all half lings who have the indicated favored class.</p><p><b>Arcanist</b>: Gain 1/6 of a new arcanist exploit.</p><p><b>Bloodrager</b>: Gain a +1/4 dodge bonus to AC while bloodraging against creatures at least one size category larger than the bloodrager.</p><p><b>Brawler</b>: Gain a +1 bonus to the brawler's CMD when resisting a grapple or overrun combat maneuver.</p><p><b>Hunter</b>: The hunter's animal companion gains a +1/4 luck bonus on saving throws. If the hunter replaces her animal companion, the new companion gains this bonus.</p><p><b>Investigator</b>: Add one extract formula from the investigator's list to his formula book. This formula must be at least 1 level lower than the highest level of formula the investigator can create.</p><p><b>Shaman</b>: Add 1/2 to the shaman's effective class level for the purpose of determining her spirit animal's natural armor adjustment, Intelligence, and special abilities.</p><p><b>Skald</b>: Choose a weapon from the following list: dagger, sling, or any weapon with the word \"half ling\" in its name. Add a +1/2 bonus on critical hit confirmation rolls with that weapon (maximum bonus +4).

The following options are available to all half-orcs who have the indicated favored class.</p><p><b>Arcanist</b>: Gain a +1 bonus on concentration checks made because of taking damage while casting arcanist spells.</p><p><b>Bloodrager</b>: Increase the bloodrager's total number of bloodrage rounds per day by 1.</p><p><b>Brawler</b>: Add 1/4 to the brawler's effective level to determine her unarmed strike damage.</p><p><b>Hunter</b>: Add 1 hit point to the hunter's animal companion. If the hunter replaces her animal companion, the new companion gains these bonus hit points.</p><p><b>Investigator</b>: Gain a +1/3 bonus on critical hit confirmation rolls made while using studied combat (maximum bonus +5). This bonus does not stack with those gained through Critical Focus and similar effects.</p><p><b>Shaman</b>: Add one spell from the cleric spell list that isn't on the shaman spell list to the list of spells the shaman knows.

The following options are available to all humans who have the indicated favored class.</p><p><b>Arcanist</b>: Add one spell from the arcanist spell list to the arcanist's spellbook. This spell must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell the arcanist can cast.</p><p><b>Bloodrager</b>: Increase the bloodrager's total number of bloodrage rounds per day by 1.</p><p><b>Brawler</b>: Gain a +1 bonus to the brawler's CMD when resisting two combat maneuvers of the brawler's choice.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Hunter</b>: Add 1 skill rank to the hunter's animal companion.

This ability replaces the cleric's weapon and armor proficiency.</p><p><b>Ecclesitheurge's Vow</b>: At 1st level, an ecclesitheurge makes a vow to his deity to protect himself solely with his faith, not with armor or shields.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>An ecclesitheurge who wears armor or uses a shield is unable to use his blessing of the faithful ability, to use cleric domain powers, or to cast cleric spells.</p><p><b>Blessing of the Faithful (Su)</b>: As a standard action, the ecclesitheurge can bless one ally within close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels). A blessed ally gains a +2 sacred or profane bonus (depending on whether the ecclesitheurge channels positive or negative energy) on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, or saving throws or to AC until the ecclesitheurge's next turn. The ecclesitheurge can expend 1 use of channel energy when activating this ability to increase the duration to a number of rounds equal to the number of dice of his channel energy.</p><p><b>Domain Mastery</b>: At 1st level, when an ecclesitheurge chooses his cleric domains, he designates one as his primary domain and the other as his secondary domain. An ecclesitheurge can use his non-domain spell slots to prepare spells from his primary domain's spell list.</p><p>Each day when he prepares spells, an ecclesitheurge can select a different domain granted by his deity and gain access to that domain's spell list instead of his secondary domain's spell list. He does not lose access to his secondary domain's granted powers or gain access to the other domain's granted powers. For example, an ecclesitheurge of Sarenrae with Glory and his primary domain and Good as his secondary domain can choose to gain access to the Healing domain; until the next time he prepares spells, he uses the Healing domain spell list as his secondary domain spell list instead of the Good domain spell list, but still keeps the granted powers of the Good domain and does not gain the granted powers of the Healing domain.</p><p>This ability alters the domains ability.</p><p><b>Bonded Holy Symbol (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, an ecclesitheurge forms a powerful bond with a holy symbol of his deity, which functions identically to a wizard's bonded object except it can be used to cast cleric and domain spells (instead of wizard spells) and the ecclesitheurge can grant his bonded holy symbol only magic abilities appropriate for a holy symbol or a neck slot item.</p><p>As with a wizard's bonded item, an ecclesitheurge can add additional magic abilities to his bonded holy symbol as if he had the required item creation feat (typically Craft Wondrous Item), provided he meets the feat's level prerequisite. For example, an ecclesitheurge with a bonded holy symbol who wants to add a wondrous amulet ability, like <i>amulet of natural armor</i>, to his bonded holy symbol must be at least 3rd level to do so. The magic properties of a bonded holy symbol, including any magic abilities the ecclesitheurge added to the object, function only for the ecclesitheurge. If a bonded holy symbol's owner dies or the item is replaced, the object loses all enhancements the ecclesitheurge added using this ability.</p><p>This ability replaces the increase to channel energy gained at 3rd level.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"PzWo7Nlnv5932L75"}

For many characters, the spells they know or prepare are far more important than any pieces of equipment they bring on excursions. Spellcasters of every stripe are constantly finding new and interesting ways to harness and use magical energies, be they divine or arcane.</p><p>Many of the spells presented in this chapter are tailor-made to complement the abilities and talents of the new classes presented in this book, but still more also benefit casters from the classes presented in the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>, <i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide</i>, and <i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic</i>. Even the gunslinger, the ninja, and the samurai will find some of the following spells appealing, though such characters will have to either multiclass into a spellcasting class or find a trusty spellcasting companion who can bolster them with these eldritch benefits.</p><p>The following lists summarize the new spells presented in this book, arranged by class and level. A superscript \"F\" or \"M\" appearing at the end of a spell's name in the spell lists denotes a focus or a material component not normally included in a spell component pouch.</p><p><b>Order of Presentation</b>: These lists present the spells in alphabetical order by name, except when a spell's name begins with \"communal,\" \"lesser,\" \"greater,\" or \"mass,\" in which case it is alphabetized under the second word of the spell name.</p><p><b>Hit Dice</b>: The term \"Hit Dice\" is used synonymously with \"character levels\" for effects that affect a specific number of Hit Dice of creatures.</p><p><b>Caster Level</b>: A spell's power often depends on caster level, which is defined as the caster's class level for the purpose of casting a particular spell. Unless otherwise indicated, the word \"level\" in the short spell descriptions that follow always refers to caster level.</p><p><b>Creatures and Characters</b>: \"Creature\" and \"character\" are used synonymously in the short descriptions.</p><p><b>Communal Spells</b>: Communal spells function like other spells, except they allow you to divide the duration among multiple targets, treating each target as a subject of the spell. When you divide the duration, you must divide it as evenly as possible among the targets. Furthermore, unless a communal spell's description indicates otherwise, no target can receive a duration increment smaller than the smallest increment of duration given in the spell description. For example, if you are 5th level, your communal spell's duration is 1 minute per level, and you have four targets, then each target must receive 1 minute of duration. The extra 1 minute of duration must be assigned to one of the four targets (your choice) or it is wasted.</p><p><b>A Note on Alchemists</b>: Alchemists can dispense communal formulae to creatures only if they have the infusion discovery. Without it, an alchemist cannot use communal spells as formulae.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter4spells\">^ Spells</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter5gearandmagicitems\">Gear and Magic Items</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"TnfmHez5hbNyph51"}

<text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>CLASS FEATURES</h1><p>The following are the class features of the arcanist.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies</b>: Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with an arcanist's gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see Arcane Spells and Armor on page 83 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>).</p><p><b>Spells</b>: An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they're cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn't yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.</p><p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell's level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the arcanist's Intelligence modifier.</p><p>An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1-3 in the <i>Core Rulebook</i>).</p><p>An arcanist may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1-2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells an arcanist can prepare.</p><p>An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day.</p><p>Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options-a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p><p><b>Spellbooks</b>: An arcanist must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She can't prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for <i>read magic</i>(which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p><p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level sorcerer/wizard spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in wizards' or other arcanists' spellbooks to her own (see Chapter 9 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>).</p><p><b>Arcane Reservoir (Su)</b>: An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist's arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist's level. Each day, when the arcanist prepares spells, the arcanist's arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p><p>Points from the arcane reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist's powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell's DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p><p><b>Arcanist Exploits</b>: By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC of an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist's level + the arcanist's Charisma modifier.</p><p><i>Acid Jet (Su)</i>: The arcanist can unleash a jet of acid by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir and making a ranged touch attack against any one target within 30 feet. If the attack hits, it deals an amount of acid damage equal to 1d6 + the arcanist's Charisma modifier, plus an additional 1d6 points of acid damage for every 2 levels beyond 1st (to a maximum of 10d6 at 19th level). The target is also sickened for 1d4 rounds. It can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to negate the sickened condition.</p><p><i>Arcane Barrier (Su)</i>: As a swift action, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to create a barrier of magic that protects her from harm. This barrier grants the arcanist a number of temporary hit points equal to her arcanist level + her Charisma modifier, and lasts for 1 minute per arcanist level or until all the temporary hit points have been lost. Each additional time per day the arcanist uses this ability, the number of arcane reservoir points she must spend to activate it increases by 1 (so the second time it is used, the arcanist must expend 2 points from her arcane reservoir, 3 points for the third time, and so on). The temporary hit points from this ability do not stack with themselves, but additional uses do cause the total number of temporary hit points and the duration to reset.</p><p><i>Arcane Weapon (Su)</i>: As a standard action, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to enhance her weapon. The weapon is treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 5th level, the weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus, which increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 5th (to a maximum of +4 at 17th level). These bonuses stack with any existing bonuses the weapon might have, to a maximum of +5. An arcanist can also use this exploit to add one of the following weapon special abilities: <i>dancing</i>, <i>defending</i>, <i>distance</i>, <i>flaming</i>, <i>flaming burst</i>, <i>frost</i>, <i>icy burst</i>, <i>keen</i>, <i>shock</i>, <i>shocking burst</i>, <i>speed</i>, <i>spell storing</i>, or <i>throwing</i>. Adding any of these special abilities consumes an amount of enhancement bonus equal to the ability's base price modifier. Duplicate special abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added to it before any weapon special abilities can be added. The benefits are decided upon when the exploit is used, and they cannot be changed unless the exploit is used again. These benefits apply only to a weapon wielded by the arcanist; if another creature attempts to wield the weapon, it loses these benefits, though they resume if the arcanist regains possession of the weapon. The arcanist cannot have more than one use of this ability active at a time. This effect lasts for a number of minutes equal to the arcanist's Charisma modifier (minimum 1).</p><p><i>Bloodline Development</i>: The arcanist selects one sorcerer bloodline upon taking this exploit. The arcanist gains that bloodline's 1st-level bloodline power as though she were a 1st-level sorcerer. The arcanist must select an ordinary bloodline with this ability, not one altered by an archetype. As a swift action, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to bolster her latent nature, allowing her to treat her arcanist level as her sorcerer level for the purpose of using this ability, which lasts for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1).</p><p>She does not gain any other abilities when using this exploit in this way, such as bloodline arcana or bloodline powers gained at 3rd level or higher. If this ability is used to gain an arcane bond and a bonded item is selected, the arcanist can use that item only to cast spells that a sorcerer of that level could cast (limiting her to 1st-level spells unless she spends a point from her arcane reservoir).</p><p>If the arcanist already has a bloodline (or gains one later), taking this exploit instead allows her arcanist levels to stack with the levels of the class that granted her access to the bloodline when determining the powers and abilities of her bloodline.</p><p><i>Consume Magic Items (Su)</i>: The arcanist can consume the power of potions, scrolls, staves, and wands, using them to fill her arcane reservoir. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Using this ability is a move action that provokes an attack of opportunity. When using this exploit, the arcanist adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to 1/2 the level of the spell contained in the item (0-level and 1st-level spells do not recharge the arcanist's arcane reservoir). If used on a potion or scroll, the item is destroyed. If used on a wand, the wand loses 5 charges; if it has fewer than 5 charges, the wand is destroyed and the arcanist gains no benefit. If used on a staff, it loses 1 charge and the arcanist gains a number of points to his arcane reservoir equal to the level of the highest-level spell the staff can cast using only 1 charge; if the staff has no spells that require only 1 charge, the arcanist cannot consume that staff 's magic. No more than 1 charge can be drawn from a staff each day in this way. Points gained in excess of the arcanist's reservoir's maximum are lost. This exploit has no effect on magic armor, weapons, rings, rods, wondrous items, or other magic items besides those noted above.</p><p><i>Counterspell (Su)</i>: By expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir, the arcanist can attempt to counter a spell as it is being cast. She must identify the spell being cast as normal. If she successfully does so, the arcanist can attempt to counter the spell as an immediate action and by expending an available arcanist spell slot of a level at least one higher than the level of the spell being cast. To counterspell, the arcanist must attempt a dispel check as if using <i>dispel magic</i>. If the spell being countered is one that the arcanist has prepared, she can instead expend an available arcanist spell slot of the same level, and she receives a +5 bonus on the dispel check. Counterspelling in this way does not trigger any feats or other abilities that normally occur when a spellcaster successfully counters a spell.</p><p><i>Dimensional Slide (Su)</i>: The arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to create a dimensional crack that she can step through to reach another location. This ability is used as part of a move action or withdraw action, allowing her to move up to 10 feet per arcanist level to any location she can see. This counts as 5 feet of movement. She can only use this ability once per round. She does not provoke attacks of opportunity when moving in this way, but any other movement she attempts as part of her move action provokes as normal.</p><p><i>Energy Shield (Su)</i>: The arcanist can protect herself from energy damage as a standard action by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir. She must pick one energy type and gains resistance 10 against that energy type for 1 minute per arcanist level. This protection increases by 5 for every 5 levels the arcanist possesses (up to a maximum of resistance 30 at 20th level).</p><p><i>Familiar (Ex)</i>: An arcanist with this exploit can acquire a familiar as the arcane bond wizard class feature, using her arcanist level as her wizard level to determine any of the statistics and abilities of the familiar. If the arcanist receives a familiar from another class, her levels of arcanist stack with the levels from that class when determining the familiar's statistics and abilities (this ability does not stack with a familiar gained through the bloodline development exploit; she must choose one or the other).</p><p><i>Flame Arc (Su)</i>: The arcanist can unleash an arc of flame by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir. This creates a 30-foot line of flame that deals a number of points of fire damage equal to 1d6 + the arcanist's Charisma modifier, plus an additional 1d6 points for every 2 levels beyond 1st (to a maximum of 10d6 at 19th level) to each target in the line. Creatures in the area of effect can attempt a Reflex saving throw to halve the damage.</p><p><i>Force Strike (Su)</i>: The arcanist can unleash a blast of force by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir. This attack automatically strikes one target within 30 feet (as <i>magic missile</i>) and deals a number of points of force damage equal to 1d4 + 1 per arcanist level. Spells and effects that negate <i>magic missile</i>also negate this effect.</p><p><i>Ice Missile (Su)</i>: The arcanist can unleash a freezing projectile by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir and making a ranged touch attack against any one target within 30 feet. If the attack hits, it deals a number of points of cold damage equal to 1d6 + the arcanist's Charisma modifier, plus an additional 1d6 points for every 2 levels beyond 1st (to a maximum of 10d6 points at 19th level). In addition, the target is staggered for 1 round. It can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to negate the staggered condition.</p><p><i>Item Crafting</i>: The arcanist can select one item creation feat as a bonus feat. She must meet the prerequisites of this feat.</p><p><i>Lightning Lance (Su)</i>: The arcanist can unleash a lance of lightning by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir and making a ranged touch attack against any one target within 30 feet. If the attack hits, it deals a number of points of electricity damage equal to 1d6 + the arcanist's Charisma modifier, plus an additional 1d6 points for every 2 levels beyond 1st (to a maximum of 10d6 at 19th level). The target's vision is also impaired, causing the target to treat all creatures as if they had concealment (20% miss chance) for 1 round. It can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to negate the impaired vision.</p><p><i>Metamagic Knowledge</i>: The arcanist can select one metamagic feat as a bonus feat. She must meet the prerequisites of this feat.</p><p><i>Metamixing (Su)</i>: The arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to add a metamagic feat that she knows to a spell as she casts it without affecting the casting time (though using a higher-level spell slot as normal). She can use this ability to add a metamagic feat to a spell that she prepared using a metamagic feat, although she cannot add the same metamagic feat to a given spell more than once.</p><p><i>Potent Magic (Su)</i>: Whenever the arcanist expends 1 point from her arcane reservoir to increase the caster level of a spell, the caster level increases by 2 instead of 1. Whenever she expends 1 point from her arcane reservoir to increase a spell's DC, it increases by 2 instead of 1.</p><p><i>Quick Study (Ex)</i>: The arcanist can prepare a spell in place of an existing spell by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir. Using this ability is a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. The arcanist must be able to reference her spellbook when using this ability. The spell prepared must be of the same level as the spell being replaced.</p><p><i>School Understanding</i>: The arcanist can select one arcane school from any of the schools available to a character with the arcane school wizard class feature, but does not have to select any opposition schools. The arcanist gains one ability of that arcane school as though she were a 1st-level wizard, using her Charisma modifier in place of her Intelligence modifier for this ability. The ability must be one gained at 1st level and is limited in its use per day to 3 + the arcanist's Charisma modifier. As a swift action, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to bolster her understanding, allowing her to treat her arcanist level as her wizard level for the purpose of using this ability for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). During this time, she also gains use of the other ability gained at 1st level for her selected school. She does not gain any other abilities when using this exploit in this way, such as those gained at 8th level.</p><p>If the arcanist already has an arcane school (or gains one later), taking this exploit instead allows her arcanist levels to stack with the levels of the class that granted the arcane school when determining the powers and abilities of her arcane school.</p><p><i>See Magic (Su)</i>: The arcanist can see magical auras. If she expends 1 point from her arcane reservoir, for 1 minute she instantly recognizes magic item auras and spell effects (as per <i>detect magic</i>). During this time, she is treated as if she had studied each aura for 3 rounds, and she treats her Knowledge (arcana) check as if she had rolled a 15 on the d20. In addition, if she touches a magic item during this time, she can immediately identify its properties using Spellcraft without needing to spend 3 rounds examining the object. If an enemy possesses the object, the arcanist must first succeed at a melee touch attack in order to touch the item.</p><p><i>Spell Disruption (Su)</i>: The arcanist can temporarily disrupt a spell by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir and succeeding at a dispel check against the spell, as <i>dispel magic</i>. This ability suppresses a spell effect for a number of rounds equal to the arcanist's Charisma modifier (minimum 1). If the spell affects multiple creatures, this ability only suppresses the spell for one creature. At the end of this duration, the spell resumes and the suppressed rounds do not count against its total duration. This ability can be used on unwilling targets, but the arcanist must succeed at a melee touch attack, and the target may attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect. This ability has no effect on spells that are instantaneous or have a duration of permanent.</p><p><i>Spell Resistance (Su)</i>: The arcanist can grant herself spell resistance for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1) as a standard action by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir. This spell resistance is equal to 6 + her arcanist level and cannot be suppressed, but it can be ended as a free action on her turn.</p><p><i>Spell Tinkerer (Su)</i>: The arcanist can alter an existing spell effect by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir. To use this ability, she must be adjacent to the spell effect (or the effect's target) and be aware of the effect. She can choose to increase or decrease the remaining duration of the spell by 50%. This ability can be used on unwilling targets, but the arcanist must succeed at a melee touch attack, and the target may attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect. This ability cannot be used on a given spell effect more than once. This ability has no effect on spells that are instantaneous or have a duration of permanent.</p><p><i>Swift Consume (Ex)</i>: The arcanist can use the consume spells class feature or the consume magic items exploit as swift actions instead of as move actions.</p><p><b>Cantrips</b>: Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1-2. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p><p><b>Consume Spells (Su)</b>: At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir's maximum are lost.</p><p><b>Greater Exploits</b>: At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p><p><i>Alter Enhancements (Su)</i>: An arcanist with this exploit can modify the enhancements placed on a weapon, suit of armor, or shield. The arcanist can use this exploit to change one weapon or armor special ability to another with an equal cost. This ability can be used to change only the item's special abilities, not its enhancement bonus. Using this ability requires the arcanist to touch the item as a full-round action and expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir, and doing so provokes an attack of opportunity. This ability cannot be used on an item in the possession of an unwilling creature. This change lasts for a number of minutes equal to the arcanist's Charisma modifier (minimum 1). The arcanist must have the arcane weapon exploit to select this exploit.</p><p><i>Burning Flame (Su)</i>: Whenever the arcanist uses the flame arc exploit, she can expend 2 points from her arcane reservoir instead of one. If she does, each target catches on fire if it fails its saving throw. Until the fire is extinguished, the target takes 3d6 points of fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can attempt a Reflex saving throw as a full-round action to extinguish the flames. Applying at least 1 gallon of water to the target automatically extinguishes the flames. The arcanist must have the flame arc exploit to select this exploit.</p><p><i>Counter Drain (Su)</i>: Whenever the arcanist successfully uses the counterspell exploit, she regains a number of points to her arcane reservoir, which is determined by the level of the spell countered. Spells of 2nd level or lower do not restore any points to her arcane reservoir. Spells of 3rd and higher restore 1 point to her arcane reservoir for every three spell levels (rounded down), to a maximum of 3 points at 9th level. The arcanist must have the counterspell exploit to select this exploit.</p><p><i>Dancing Electricity (Su)</i>: Whenever the arcanist uses the lightning lance exploit, she can expend 2 points from her arcane reservoir instead of one. If she does, all creatures adjacent to the target take an amount of damage equal to half the amount of electricity damage rolled. Adjacent creatures can attempt a Reflex saving throw to halve this damage. Whether or not the target makes its saving throw has no effect on adjacent targets. The arcanist must have the lightning lance exploit to select this exploit.</p><p><i>Energy Absorption (Su)</i>: Whenever the arcanist is using the energy shield exploit, and the shield prevents 10 or more points of damage, she can absorb a portion of that energy and use it to fuel her exploits. After absorbing the damage, she can use any exploit that deals the same type of energy damage as the type her shield absorbed, reducing the cost to her arcane reservoir by 1 point. She must use this energy within 1 minute or it is lost. The arcanist does not gain more than one such use of energy per round, and she cannot store more than one use of this energy at a time. The arcanist must have the energy shield exploit to select this exploit.</p><p><i>Greater Counterspell (Su)</i>: Whenever the arcanist uses the counterspell exploit, she can expend any arcanist spell slot of the same level or greater than the spell to be countered (instead of the spell level + 1). The arcanist must have the counterspell exploit to select this exploit.</p><p><i>Greater Metamagic Knowledge</i>: The arcanist can select a metamagic feat as a bonus feat. She must meet the prerequisites of this feat. Each morning, when she prepares her spells, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to exchange this bonus feat for another metamagic feat, as long as she meets the prerequisites of the new feat. The arcanist must have the metamagic knowledge exploit to select this exploit.</p><p><i>Greater Spell Resistance (Su)</i>: Whenever the arcanist uses the spell resistance exploit, the spell resistance is equal to 11 + the arcanist's level. The arcanist must have the spell resistance exploit to select this exploit.</p><p><i>Greater Spell Disruption (Su)</i>: The arcanist can disrupt a spell effect or magic item by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir. This acts like a targeted <i>dispel magic</i>with a range of touch. The arcanist can add her Charisma modifier to the dispel check. The arcanist must have the spell disruption exploit to select this exploit.</p><p><i>Icy Tomb (Su)</i>: Whenever the arcanist uses the ice missile exploit, she can expend 2 points from her arcane reservoir instead of one. If she does, the target is coated in rime if it fails its saving throw. As long as the ice remains (typically 1 minute per level in a warm area), the target is entangled (although not anchored) and takes 1 point of Dexterity damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can break free from the ice as a standard action by making a Strength check with a DC equal to 10 + the arcanist's Charisma modifier. If the target takes more than 10 points of fire damage from a single attack, the ice melts and the effect ends. The arcanist must have the ice missile arcanist exploit to select this exploit.</p><p><i>Lingering Acid (Su)</i>: Whenever the arcanist uses the acid jet exploit, she can expend 2 points from her arcane reservoir instead of one. If she does, the target takes additional damage on the following rounds if it fails its saving throw. The target takes 1d6 points of acid damage on the following round for every 2d6 points of acid damage dealt by the initial attack. On subsequent rounds, the target continues to take 1d6 points of acid damage for every 2d6 points of acid damage dealt on the previous round. The damage continues until the amount of acid damage dealt on the previous round by this effect is 1d6. For example, a 9th level arcanist would deal 5d6 points of acid damage + the arcanist's Charisma modifier, 2d6 points of acid damage on the following round, and 1d6 points of acid damage on the third and final round. The arcanist must have the acid jet exploit to select this exploit.</p><p><i>Redirect Spell (Su)</i>: The arcanist can gain control of a spell cast by another spellcaster. As a standard action by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir, the arcanist can make a caster level check opposed by the creature controlling the spell. If the arcanist is successful, she can direct the spell as a free action for 1 round, making any decisions allowed by the spell. This only functions on spells that can be directed or changed once they have been cast, such as <i>flaming sphere</i>or <i>spiritual weapon</i>. The spell returns to its owner's control at the start of the arcanist's next turn, unless the arcanist expends another point from her arcane reservoir at the start of her turn to extend the duration of control by another round. She can continue to control the spell for as long as the spell lasts, provided she keeps spending points from her arcane reservoir.</p><p><i>Resistance Drain (Su)</i>: Whenever the arcanist is using the spell resistance exploit, she can end the effect as an immediate action whenever her spell resistance successfully protects her from a spell cast by a foe. If she does so, she adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to 1/2 the level of the spell. These points are temporary and are lost after 1 minute unless used. Points gained in excess of her arcane reservoir's maximum are lost. The arcanist must have the greater spell resistance exploit to select this exploit.</p><p><i>Siphon Spell (Su)</i>: When the arcanist uses the greater spell disruption exploit, she can siphon some of the power of the targeted spell to restore her arcane reservoir. If the caster level of the spell is equal to or higher than that of the arcanist, and she exceeds the DC of the dispel check by 5 or more, she adds 1 point to her arcane reservoir. If she exceeds this check by 10 or more, she instead adds 2 points to her arcane reservoir. This has no effect on magic items. The arcanist must have the greater spell disruption exploit to select this exploit.</p><p><i>Spell Thief (Su)</i>: The arcanist can steal a spell affecting one creature by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir. If the creature is unwilling, she must succeed at a melee touch attack to steal the spell; the target can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect. The arcanist can specify a spell affecting the target to steal, but if she's incorrect or doesn't know what spells are affecting the target, the spell stolen is determined randomly from all those affecting the target. If successful, the spell effect transfers to the arcanist, affecting her for the remaining duration. Unless the effect normally allows for a new saving throw during its duration (such as at the end of each round), this ability doesn't grant the arcanist a saving throw against it. The arcanist cannot use this ability to steal a spell with a range of personal or a duration of permanent. The arcanist must have the spell tinkerer exploit to select this exploit.</p><p><i>Suffering Knowledge (Su)</i>: The arcanist can learn to cast a spell by suffering from its effects. When the arcanist fails a saving throw against a spell cast by an enemy, as an immediate action she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to temporarily acquire the spell. She can cast the spell using her spell slots as if it was a spell she had prepared that day. The spell must be on the sorcerer/wizard spell list and must be of a level that she can cast. The ability to cast this spell remains for a number of rounds equal to the arcanist's Charisma modifier (minimum 1).</p><p><b>Magical Supremacy (Su)</b>: At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1classes\">^Classes</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">Archetypes and Class Options</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"VnARa3t88mNf87Nk"}

The blessings a deity grants have the same names as the deity's domains. Unless otherwise noted, using a blessing is a standard action. A warpriest without a deity can select any two blessings (subject to GM discretion). If a blessing's power duplicates a spell effect, the warpriest's caster level for that power is equal to his warpriest level. Blessings that affect weapons and armor benefit anyone who wields or wears affected items, not just the warpriest.</p><h1>Air Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Gozreh, Shelyn.</p><p><b>Zephyr's Gift (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can touch any one ranged weapon and enhance it with the quality of air. For 1 minute, any attacks made with the weapon take no penalties due to range. In addition, making a ranged attack with this weapon doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.</p><p><b>Soaring Assault (major)</b>: At 10th level, you can touch an ally and give her the gift of flight for 1 minute (as <i>fly</i>). The ally gains a fly speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability. She gains a bonus on Fly checks equal to your level. Whenever the ally succeeds at a charge attack while flying, that attack deals an amount of additional electricity damage equal to your level.</p><h1>Animal Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Erastil, Gozreh.</p><p><b>Animal Fury (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can touch one ally and grant it feral features for 1 minute. The ally gains two claw attacks that each deal 1d6 points of damage if the ally is Medium or 1d4 points if it's Small, or one bite attack that deals 1d8 points of damage if the ally is Medium or 1d6 points if it's Small. These are primary natural attacks that replace any similar primary natural attacks the ally might have.</p><p><b>Battle Companion (major)</b>: At 10th level, you can summon a battle companion. This ability functions as <i>summon nature's ally V</i>, but with a duration of 1 minute. This ability can summon only one animal, regardless of the list used. For every 2 levels beyond 10th, the level of the <i>summon nature's ally</i>spell increases by 1 (to a maximum of <i>summon nature's ally IX</i>at 18th level).</p><h1>Artifice Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Torag.</p><p><b>Crafter's Wrath (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can touch one melee weapon and grant it greater power to harm and destroy crafted objects. For 1 minute, whenever this weapon deals damage to constructs or objects, it bypasses hardness and damage reduction.</p><p><b>Transfer Magic (major)</b>: At 10th level, you can temporarily transfer a weapon special ability from one weapon to another. The bearers of each of the weapons must be willing, and you must be touching both weapons to activate this ability. You can transfer a weapon special ability with a base price modifier of +1 or +2. If you are using this ability on a double weapon, only one end of the double weapon is affected. The transfer lasts for 1 minute, after which the transferred weapon special ability automatically returns to the source weapon. You can use this ability multiple times on the same weapon or weapons. Alternatively, you can use transfer magic to move a +1 or +2 armor enhancement bonus from one touched suit of armor to another, or move a +1 or +2 armor or weapon enhancement bonus to another suit of armor or weapon.</p><h1>Chaos Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Calistria, Cayden Cailean, Desna, Gorum, Lamashtu, Rovagug.</p><p><b>Anarchic Strike (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can touch one weapon and grant it a chaotic blessing. For 1 minute, this weapon glows yellow or purple and deals an additional 1d6 points of damage against lawful creatures. During this time, it's treated as chaotic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This blessing's additional damage doesn't stack with the additional damage from the <i>anarchic</i>weapon special ability.</p><p><b>Battle Companion (major)</b>: At 10th level, you can summon a battle companion. This ability functions as <i>summon monster IV</i>, but its duration is 1 minute, and it works only on a chaotic outsider or an animal with the entropic creature simple template (<i>Bestiary 2</i>293). This ability can summon only one creature, regardless of the list used. For every 2 levels beyond 10th, the level of the <i>summon monster</i>spell increases by 1 (to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX</i>at 20th level).</p><h1>Charm Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Calistria, Cayden Cailean, Norgorber, Shelyn.</p><p><b>Charming Presence (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can touch an ally and grant an entrancing blessing. For 1 minute, the ally becomes mesmerizing to her opponents, filling them with either abject admiration or paralyzing fear. This effect functions as <i>sanctuary</i>, except if the ally attacks an opponent, the effect ends for that opponent. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p><p><b>Dominance Aura (major)</b>: At 10th level, you can surround yourself with a tangible aura of majesty for 1 minute. While this aura is active, once per round as a swift action you can issue a command (as the <i>command</i>spell) to one creature within 30 feet; the creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or submit for 1 round.</p><h1>Community Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Erastil.</p><p><b>Communal Aid (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can touch an ally and grant it the blessing of community. For 1 minute, whenever that ally uses the aid another action, the bonus granted increases to +4. You can instead use this ability on yourself as a swift action.</p><p><b>Fight as One (major)</b>: At 10th level, you can rally your allies to fight together. For 1 minute, whenever you make a successful melee or ranged attack against a foe, allies within 10 feet of you gain a +2 insight bonus on attacks of the same type you made against that foe-melee attacks if you made a melee attack, or ranged attacks if you made a ranged attack. If you score a critical hit, this bonus increases to +4 until the start of your next turn.</p><h1>Darkness Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Zon-Kuthon.</p><p><b>Enshrouding Darkness (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can touch an ally and bestow a darkness blessing. For 1 minute, the ally becomes enshrouded in shadows while in combat, granting it concealment (20% miss chance). Creatures that are normally able to see in supernatural darkness ignore this concealment.</p><p><b>Darkened Vision (major)</b>: At 10th level, you can place a shroud of darkness around the eyes of one foe within 30 feet. The target must succeed at a Will saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute (as <i>blindness/deafness</i>).</p><h1>Death Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Norgorber, Pharasma, Urgathoa, Zon-Kuthon.</p><p><b>From the Grave (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can take on a corpse-like visage for 1 minute, making you more intimidating and giving you undead-like protection from harm. You gain a +4 bonus on Disguise checks to resemble an undead creature and on Intimidate checks, as well as a +2 profane bonus on saving throws against disease, mind-affecting effects, paralysis, poison, and stunning.</p><p><b>Death's Touch (major)</b>: At 10th level, you can make a melee touch attack against an opponent to deliver grim suffering. If you succeed, you inflict 1 temporary negative level on the target for 1 minute. Alternatively, you can activate this ability as a swift action when you hit an opponent with a melee attack. These temporary negative levels stack. You gain no benefit from imposing these negative levels (such as the temporary hit points undead gain from <i>enervation</i>).</p><h1>Destruction Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Gorum, Nethys, Rovagug, Zon-Kuthon.</p><p><b>Destructive Attacks (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can touch an ally and bless it with the power of destruction. For 1 minute, the ally gains a morale bonus on weapon damage rolls equal to half your level (minimum 1).</p><p><b>Heart of Carnage (major)</b>: At 10th level, you can touch an ally and bless it with even greater destructive power. For 1 minute, the ally gains a +4 insight bonus on attack rolls made to confirm critical hits and has a 50% chance to treat any critical hit or sneak attack against it as a normal hit.</p><h1>Earth Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Abadar, Torag.</p><p><b>Acid Strike (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can touch one weapon and enhance it with acidic potency. For 1 minute, the weapon emits acrid fumes that deal an additional 1d4 points of acid damage with each strike. This additional damage doesn't stack with the additional damage from the <i>corrosive</i>(UE) weapon special ability.</p><p><b>Armor of Earth (major)</b>: At 10th level, you can touch an ally and harden its armor or clothing. For 1 minute, the ally gains DR 1/-. For every 2 levels beyond 10th, this DR increases by 1 (to a maximum of DR 5/- at 18th level). This doesn't stack with any other damage resistance.</p><h1>Evil Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Asmodeus, Lamashtu, Norgorber, Rovagug, Urgathoa, Zon-Kuthon.</p><p><b>Unholy Strike (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can touch one weapon and give it an evil blessing. For 1 minute, the weapon takes on a black, orange, or violet cast and deals an additional 1d6 points of damage against good creatures. During this time, it's treated as evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This additional damage doesn't stack with the additional damage from the <i>unholy</i>weapon special ability.</p><p><b>Battle Companion (major)</b>: At 10th level, you can summon a battle companion. This ability functions as <i>summon monster IV</i>, but its duration is 1 minute, and it works only on an evil outsider or an animal with the fiendish creature simple template. This ability can summon only one creature, regardless of the list used. For every 2 levels beyond 10th, the level of the <i>summon monster</i>spell increases by 1 (to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX</i>at 20th level).</p><h1>Fire Blessing</h1><p><b>Deity</b>: Asmodeus, Sarenrae.</p><p><b>Fire Strike (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can touch one weapon and enhance it with the grandeur of fire. For 1 minute, the weapon glows red-hot and deals an additional 1d4 points of fire damage with each hit. This additional damage doesn't stack with the additional damage from the <i>flaming</i>or <i>flaming burst</i>weapon special ability.</p><p><b>Armor of Flame (major)</b>: At 10th level, you can touch an ally to wreathe it in flames. This ability works as <i>fire shield</i>(warm shield only), but with a duration of 1 minute.</p><h1>Glory Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Gorum, Iomedae, Sarenrae.</p><p><b>Glorious Presence (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can touch an ally and grant it a glorious blessing. For 1 minute, the ally becomes mesmerizing to her foes. This functions as <i>sanctuary</i>, except if the ally attacks an opponent, this effect ends for that opponent. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p><p><b>Demoralizing Glory (major)</b>: At 10th level, when you successfully damage an opponent with a melee attack or attack spell, as a swift action you can attempt to demoralize that opponent with the Intimidate skill using your ranks in Intimidate or your warpriest level, whichever is higher.</p><h1>Good Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Cayden Cailean, Desna, Erastil, Iomedae, Sarenrae, Shelyn, Torag.</p><p><b>Holy Strike (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can touch one weapon and bless it with the power of purity and goodness. For 1 minute, this weapon glows green, white, or yellow-gold and deals an additional 1d6 points of damage against evil creatures. During this time, it's treated as good for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This additional damage doesn't stack with the additional damage from the <i>holy</i>weapon special ability.</p><p><b>Battle Companion (major)</b>: At 10th level, you can summon a battle companion. This ability functions as <i>summon monster IV</i>, but its duration is 1 minute, and it works only on a good outsider or an animal with the celestial creature simple template. This ability can summon only one creature, regardless of the list used. For every 2 levels beyond 10th, the level of the <i>summon monster</i>spell increases by 1 (to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX</i>at 20th level).</p><h1>Healing Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Irori, Pharasma, Sarenrae.</p><p><b>Powerful Healer (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can add power to a cure spell as you cast it. As a swift action, you can treat any cure spell as if it were empowered (as the Empower Spell feat), causing it to heal 50% more damage (or deal 50% more damage if used against undead). This ability doesn't stack with itself or the Empower Spell feat.</p><p><b>Fast Healing (major)</b>: At 10th level, you can touch an ally and grant it fast healing 3 for 1 minute.</p><h1>Knowledge Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Calistria, Irori, Nethys, Norgorber, Pharasma.</p><p><b>Lore Keeper (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can touch a creature to learn about its abilities and weaknesses. With a successful touch attack, you gain information as if your result on the appropriate Knowledge check were equal to 15 + your warpriest level + your Wisdom modifier.</p><p><b>Monster Lore (major)</b>: At 10th level, when you succeed at a Knowledge check against an opponent to learn about its abilities or weaknesses (or succeed at a touch attack using the lore keeper blessing, above), you can as a swift action gain a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks, as well as to your AC against that creature. This effect lasts for 1 minute.</p><h1>Law Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Abadar, Asmodeus, Erastil, Iomedae, Irori, Torag, Zon-Kuthon.</p><p><b>Axiomatic Strike (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can touch one weapon and enhance it with the essence of law. For 1 minute, this weapon glows blue, pale yellow, or white and deals an extra 1d6 points of damage against chaotic creatures. During this time, it's treated as lawful for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. This extra damage doesn't stack with the additional damage from the <i>axiomatic</i>weapon special ability.</p><p><b>Battle Companion (major)</b>: At 10th level, you can summon a battle companion. This ability functions as <i>summon monster IV</i>, but its duration is 1 minute, and it works only on a lawful outsider or an animal with the resolute creature simple template (<i>Bestiary 2</i>293). This ability can summon only one creature, regardless of the list used. For every 2 levels beyond 10th, the level of the <i>summon monster</i>spell increases by 1 (to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX</i>at 20th level).</p><h1>Liberation Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Desna.</p><p><b>Liberation (minor)</b>: At 1st level, as a swift action, you can ignore for 1 round impediments to your mobility and effects that cause paralysis (as <i>freedom of movement</i>). You can activate this blessing even if you're otherwise unable to take actions, but not if you're unconscious.</p><p><b>Freedom's Shout (major)</b>: At 10th level, as a swift action you can emit a 30-foot aura that affects all allies with the liberation blessing described above. This effect lasts for 1 round.</p><h1>Luck Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Calistria, Desna, Shelyn.</p><p><b>Lucky Presence (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can touch an ally and grant it a lucky presence. The target of this luck can call upon it to roll any one ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check twice and take the better result. The decision to use this benefit must be declared before the roll is made. Once used, or once 1 minute passes, the effect ends.</p><p><b>Unlucky Enemy (major)</b>: At 10th level, as an immediate action you can force an adjacent opponent to reroll an ability check, an attack roll, a saving throw, or a skill check it just attempted; it must take the lower of the two rolls. The decision to use this benefit must be declared after the roll is made but before the result is revealed.</p><h1>Madness Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Lamashtu.</p><p><b>Madness Supremacy (minor)</b>: At 1st level, as a swift action you can target a creature within 30 feet that has the cowering, frightened, panicked, or paralyzed condition. That condition is suspended for 1 round, and the chosen creature gains the confused condition instead. The confused creature rerolls any result other than \"attack self \" or \"attack nearest creature.\" The round spent confused counts toward the duration of the suspended effect. At the end of that round, the suspended condition resumes.</p><p><b>Control Madness (major)</b>: At 10th level, as a swift action you can choose one behavior for all confused creatures within 30 feet to exhibit (as if all creatures had rolled the same result). This effect lasts for 1 round. You can use this ability even while you are confused.</p><h1>Magic Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Asmodeus, Nethys, Urgathoa.</p><p><b>Hand of the Acolyte (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can cause your melee weapon to fly from your grasp and strike an opponent, then instantly return to you. You can make a single attack using a melee weapon at a range of 30 feet. This attack is treated as a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, except that you add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll instead of your Dexterity modifier (you still add your Strength modifier to the damage roll as normal). This ability cannot be used to perform a combat maneuver.</p><p><b>Blessed Magic (major)</b>: At 10th level, you can cast a prepared warpriest spell without expending its spell slot. The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action and must use a spell slot that is at least 3 spell levels lower than the highest warpriest spell level you can cast. In addition, the spell must be one that damages a creature or causes a creature to take penalties (such as <i>inflict light wounds</i>or <i>bane</i>). For example, if you are 10th level and can cast 4th-level warpriest spells, you could use this blessing to cast a 1st-level warpriest spell without expending its spell slot.</p><h1>Nobility Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Abadar.</p><p><b>Inspiring Word (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can speak a few words to a creature within 30 feet that fill it with inspiration. You can grant that creature a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, or saving throws (your choice). This effect lasts for 1 minute.</p><p><b>Lead by Example (major)</b>: At 10th level, as a swift action you can inspire your allies to follow your lead. If the next action you take on the same turn is an attack or a skill check, every ally within 30 feet who takes the same action against the same foe or obstacle on her next turn gains a +4 morale bonus on that attack roll or skill check.</p><h1>Plant Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Erastil, Gozreh.</p><p><b>Creeping Vines (minor)</b>: At 1st level, when you hit with a melee attack, as a swift action you can cause the creature you hit to sprout vines that attempt to hold it in place, entangling it for 1 round (Reflex negates).</p><p><b>Battle Companion (major)</b>: At 10th level, you can summon a battle companion. This ability functions as <i>summon nature's ally IV</i>, but with a duration of 1 minute. This ability can summon only one animal, regardless of the list used, and the creature's type changes to plant instead of animal. For every 2 levels beyond 10th, the level of the <i>summon nature's ally</i>spell increases by 1, to a maximum of <i>summon nature's ally IX</i>at 20th level.</p><h1>Protection Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Abadar, Nethys, Shelyn, Torag.</p><p><b>Increased Defense (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can gain a +1 sacred bonus on saving throws and a +1 sacred bonus to AC for 1 minute. The bonus increases to +2 at 10th level and +3 at 20th level.</p><p><b>Aura of Protection (major)</b>: At 10th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of protection for 1 minute. You and your allies within this aura gain resistance 10 against acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic. At 15th level, the energy resistance increases to 20.</p><h1>Repose Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Pharasma.</p><p><b>Gentle Rest (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can fill a living creature with lethargy by hitting it with a melee touch attack, causing it to become staggered for 1 round. If the target is already staggered, it falls asleep for 1 round instead. An undead creature that's touched is staggered for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).</p><p><b>Back to the Grave (major)</b>: At 10th level, when using channel energy to heal living creatures, you can take a swift action on that same turn to also deal damage to undead creatures (as your channel energy ability). Undead take an amount of damage equal to half the number of hit points healed, and can attempt the normal saving throw to halve this damage.</p><h1>Rune Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Irori, Nethys.</p><p><b>Blast Rune (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can create a blast rune in any adjacent square. Any creature entering this square takes an amount of damage equal to 1d6 + 1/2 your warpriest level. This rune deals either acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, designated when you create the rune. The rune is invisible, and lasts for a number of rounds equal to your warpriest level or until discharged. You cannot create a blast rune in a square occupied by another creature. This rune counts as a 1st-level spell for the purpose of dispelling it. It can be discovered with a successful DC 26 Perception check and disarmed with a successful DC 26 Disable Device check.</p><p><b>Spell Storing Weapon (major)</b>: At 10th level, you can cast a spell into a magic weapon as if it had the <i>spell storing</i>weapon special ability. If the stored spell is not used within 10 minutes, it dissipates.</p><h1>Strength Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Cayden Cailean, Gorum, Irori, Lamashtu, Urgathoa.</p><p><b>Strength Surge (minor)</b>: At 1st level, as a swift action you can focus your own strength. You gain an enhancement bonus equal to 1/2 your warpriest level (minimum +1) on melee attack rolls, combat maneuver checks that rely on Strength, Strength-based skill checks, and Strength checks for 1 round.</p><p><b>Strength of Will (major)</b>: At 10th level, as a swift action you can ignore the movement penalties caused by wearing medium or heavy armor or by carrying a medium or heavy load. This effect lasts for 1 minute. During this time, you can add your Strength modifier on saving throws against effects that would cause you to become entangled, staggered, or paralyzed.</p><h1>Sun Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Iomedae, Sarenrae.</p><p><b>Blinding Strike (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can create a flash of sunlight in the eyes of one of your opponents. The target is blinded for 1 round. If it succeeds at a Reflex saving throw, it's instead dazzled for 1 round. Creatures with light blindness or light sensitivity take a -4 penalty on this saving throw. This is a light effect. Sightless creatures are unaffected by this ability.</p><p><b>Cleansing Fire (major)</b>: At 10th level, you can touch a weapon and grant it either the <i>flaming</i>or <i>undead-bane</i>weapon special ability for 1 minute. If you spend two uses of your blessing when activating this ability, the weapon can have both special abilities.</p><h1>Travel Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Abadar, Cayden Cailean, Desna.</p><p><b>Agile Feet (minor)</b>: At 1st level, as a swift action you gain increased mobility. For 1 round, you ignore all difficult terrain (including magical terrain) and take no penalties for moving through it.</p><p><b>Dimensional Hop (major)</b>: At 10th level, you can teleport up to 20 feet as a move action. You can increase this distance by expending another use of your blessing-each use spent grants an additional 20 feet. You must have line of sight to your destination. This teleportation doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. You can bring other willing creatures with you, but each such creature requires expending one additional use of your blessing, regardless of the distance traveled. (For example, transporting yourself 40 feet costs 2 uses of your blessing, and transporting an additional creature this distance costs 1 more use.)</p><h1>Trickery Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Asmodeus, Calistria, Lamashtu, Norgorber.</p><p><b>Double (minor)</b>: At 1st level, as a move action you can create an illusory double of yourself. This double functions as a single <i>mirror image</i>, and lasts for a number of rounds equal to your warpriest level, or until the illusory duplicate is dispelled or destroyed. You can have no more than one double at a time. The double created by this ability doesn't stack with the additional images from the <i>mirror image</i>spell.</p><p><b>Greater Invisibility (major)</b>: At 10th level, as a swift action you can become invisible (as <i>greater invisibility</i>) for 1 round.</p><h1>War Blessing</h1><p><b>Deity</b>: Gorum, Iomedae, Rovagug, Urgathoa.</p><p><b>War Mind (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can touch an ally and grant it a tactical advantage for 1 minute. Each round at the start of its turn, it can select one of the following bonuses: +10 feet to base land speed, a +1 dodge bonus to AC, a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls, or a +1 luck bonus on saving throws. Each bonus selected lasts for 1 round.</p><p><b>Battle Lust (major)</b>: At 10th level, you can touch an ally and grant it a thirst for battle. All of the ally's melee attacks are treated as if they had the <i>vicious</i>weapon special ability, but the additional damage dealt to the ally from that special ability is nonlethal. In addition, the ally receives a +4 insight bonus on attack rolls made to confirm critical hits. These benefits last for 1 minute.</p><h1>Water Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Gozreh, Pharasma.</p><p><b>Ice Strike (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can touch one weapon and enhance it with the power of water. For 1 minute, the weapon glows with a blue-white chill and deals an additional 1d4 points of cold damage with each strike. This additional damage doesn't stack with the additional damage from the <i>frost</i>or <i>icy burst</i>weapon special ability.</p><p><b>Armor of Ice (major)</b>: At 10th level, you can touch an ally and wreathe it in freezing mist. This ability works as <i>fire shield</i>(chill shield only), but with a duration of 1 minute.</p><h1>Weather Blessing</h1><p><b>Deities</b>: Gozreh, Rovagug.</p><p><b>Storm Strike (minor)</b>: At 1st level, you can touch one weapon and grant it a blessing of stormy weather. For 1 minute, this weapon glows with blue or yellow sparks and deals an additional 1d4 points of electricity damage with each hit. This additional damage doesn't stack with the additional damage from the <i>shock</i>or <i>shocking burst</i>weapon special ability.</p><p><b>Wind Barrier (major)</b>: At 10th level, you can create a barrier of fast winds around yourself for 1 minute. This acts as a <i>wind wall</i>on all sides of your square, protects you with <i>feather fall</i>, and doesn't interfere with your ranged attacks.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1classes\">^Classes</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">Archetypes and Class Options</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"Z70l0n9zQYVLVq7N"}

{"name":"Archetype Design","permission":{"default":0,"JgpLZkPryhl1EFab":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_mqyqwzciz6","path":"Pathfinder RPG - Advanced Class Guide Reference Library#/CF_SEP/ADVANCED CLASS GUIDE#/CF_SEP/CHAPTER 6: DESIGNING CLASSES","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\"></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Designing an archetype is similar to designing a class, but much of the work has already been done for you. Like a class, an archetype needs to have a concept and a rules niche, but unlike a class, its characteristics need not be specific to it. An archetype is usually very close to an existing class in terms of concept or rules, but strives to take the class in a slightly different direction, changing a few of its class features to better express its concept.</p><h1>Concept and Rules</h1><p>Many archetypes begin as a new class idea, but as they come together, it becomes apparent that they are very similar to an existing class. In such cases, it's better to create an archetype instead of an entirely new class that's trying to live in another's space. Take the skirmisher ranger archetype from the <i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide</i>, for example. As a concept, the class is very similar to a ranger: it thrives in a natural setting and is generally oriented toward martial combat. Mechanically, it lends itself to almost all of the rules of the ranger, but it gains a set of combat tricks in place of the ranger's spellcasting abilities. Creating an entirely new class with this concept doesn't make sense when a few simple alterations to the ranger itself would be sufficient.</p><h1>Design Principles</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Most of the design work on an archetype has to do with class features. As a general rule, most of the base mechanics do not change. Base attack bonus, Hit Dice, and saving throws almost never change, while skills and spellcasting need not be altered unless the archetype specifically calls for it.</p><p><b>Replacing Class Features</b>: The key to creating a successful archetype is deciding which class features to replace and what to replace them with. Generally speaking, primary class features are the hardest to replace and you should do so very carefully, whereas secondary features have a much lighter impact on the class and are more easily exchanged with new features.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>When deciding what features to replace, keep in mind the theme of the archetype. Is the feature important to the role of the archetype? if it's removed, does the class still function? Are there other features that rely upon the selected feature to function, and do they need to be replaced as well? These questions will help guide you in determining what features are critical to a class and which ones can be replaced with minimal impact.</p><p>Designing a new class feature for an archetype to replace an existing one follows many of the same rules as designing a class feature for a new class. However, you must consider the power and versatility of the feature you are replacing. Swapping out the bravery fighter class feature for a new feature that grants a bonus to AC is not a fair trade, resulting in an archetype that is more powerful than the base class. While you might endeavor to balance out this exchange by replacing another class feature with a weaker option, such replacements should be avoided if possible. If you must, try to ensure that the weaker option appears at an earlier level than the more powerful option to ensure that the \"cost\" for the new, powerful feature is paid before the benefit is gained. Doing so prevents characters from taking just a few levels in an archetype to get the powerful class feature, before swapping over to another class to avoid paying the price for that feature. As a guideline, replacement features should serve a similar role and have roughly the same power as the feature they replace. This isn't always the case, but even when deviating from the role, you should be sure that the replacement feature you are creating is not demonstrably more or less powerful than the original.</p><p><b>Partial Replacements</b>: Depending on the circumstance, it can be acceptable to swap out part of a class feature, but only if that feature has bonuses or abilities that are gained over multiple levels. For example, the fighter has the bonus feats class feature. This feature grants a bonus feat at 1st level, 2nd level, and every even-numbered level thereafter. An archetype might swap out some or all of these bonus feats, granting new class features in their place.</p><p>Be careful when deciding on a partial replacement. The rules for the feature that you are partially replacing might not indicate what to do about the later iterations of the feature that have not been replaced. Take the channel energy cleric class feature, for example. If you replace the increase to 2d6 gained at 3rd level, what happens at 5th level? Does the character advance to 2d6 or jump directly to 3d6? In such cases, it is best to replace the entire class feature or ensure that the replacement is explicit in describing how to treat the remainder of the existing class feature.</p><h1>Design Principles</h1><p><b>Alternate Classes</b>: Sometimes an archetype exchanges so many class features that it almost becomes a new class itself. In such cases, the class might warrant a representation of all of the class features, even those that it shares with its base class. While alternate classes are similar to archetypes in many ways, players who use such classes have all the tools they need to advance their characters in one convenient location. The antipaladin, the ninja, and the samurai are examples of alternate classes.</p><p><b>Hybrid Classes</b>: A hybrid class is like an archetype in that it draws heavily from existing classes, but the hybrid draws from two different classes to form the basis of its abilities. The result is an entirely new class with its own niche and features. The classes in this book are all hybrid classes.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter6designingclasses\">^Designing Classes</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_appendix\">Appendix</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"bL6IstRgm2lUCzJt"}

He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 his fighter level.</p><p>The martial master can use this ability again before the duration expires in order to replace his previously chosen combat feat with another choice. If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat's daily limit. At higher levels, when he gains multiple feats through this ability, the martial master can use those feats to meet the prerequisites of other feats he gains with this ability. Doing so means he cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another's prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward his daily uses of this ability.</p><p>At 9th level, a martial master can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time.

This ability replaces armor training 1.</p><p><b>Mutagen Discovery (Su)</b>: At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the mutation warrior can choose one of the following alchemist discoveries to augment his abilities: feral mutagen(APG), grand mutagen(APG), greater mutagen(APG), infuse mutagen(APG), nauseating flesh(UC), preserve organs(UM), rag doll mutagen(ARG), spontaneous healing(UM), tentacle(UM), vestigial arm(UM), and wings(UM).

They discover their mutagens and terrifying bombs through experimentation, sometimes with dramatic and even catastrophic effects. But leaps of new understanding arise through this experimentation, meaning that no two alchemists are truly alike. All explore the world and their own innate talents in different ways, with deeply personal fusions of science and magic. This section introduces both new alchemist discoveries and an alchemist archetype.</p><h1>DISCOVERIES</h1><p>The following discoveries can be taken by any alchemist who meets the prerequisites.</p><p><i>Grand Inspiring Cognatogen (Su)</i>: The alchemist's inspiring cognatogen now grants a +4 dodge bonus to AC and a +4 bonus to Reflex saving throws; a -6 penalty to Strength and Constitution; and the effects of having the item lore, tenacious inspiration, and underworld inspiration investigator talents. An alchemist must be at least 16th level and have the greater inspiring cognatogen discovery to select this discovery.</p><p><i>Greater Inspiring Cognatogen (Su)</i>: The alchemist's inspiring cognatogen now grants a +2 dodge bonus to AC and a +2 bonus to Reflex saving throws; a -4 penalty to Strength and Constitution; and the effects of having the amazing inspiration, eidetic recollection, and expanded inspiration investigator talents. An alchemist must be at least 12th level and must have the inspiring cognatogen discovery or class feature to select this discovery.</p><p><i>Inspired Bomb (Su)</i>: An alchemist with this discovery and a pool of inspiration (by way of a class feature, a feat, or the inspiring cognatogen discovery) can expend two uses of inspiration to increase the bomb's damage by 1d6. The type of damage the bomb deals does not change. Unlike other discoveries that affect bombs, this one can be applied to a bomb that already has another bomb discovery, though it cannot be applied to the same bomb more than once.</p><p><i>Inspiring Cognatogen (Su)</i>: An alchemist with this discovery learns how to make an inspiring cognatogen, a mutagen-like mixture that grants him inspiration (as per the investigator class feature) at the expense of Strength and Constitution. Upon drinking the inspiring cognatogen, the alchemist gains a pool of inspiration equal to 1/2 his alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). He also gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC and takes a -2 penalty to both Strength and Constitution.</p><p>As a free action, the alchemist can add 1d6 to the result of an ability check or a skill check (including any he takes 10 or takes 20 on) by expending one use of inspiration. This ability works exactly like the investigator's inspiration ability, except that the alchemist gains the pool of inspiration upon drinking the inspiring cognatogen, and any unspent inspiration is lost at the end of the cognatogen's duration. If the alchemist already has an inspiration pool, the inspiration added by the inspiring cognatogen is added to his pool, but each time he expends at least one use of inspiration while this ability is active, he must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or become dazed for 1 round. He cannot use inspiration to augment this saving throw.</p><p>All limitations of mutagens apply to an inspiring cognatogen as if they were the same substance-an alchemist can maintain only one mutagen or cognatogen (either the standard cognatogen from <i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic</i>or the inspired cognatogen) at a time, a cognatogen not in an alchemist's possession becomes inert, drinking a cognatogen makes a non-alchemist sick, and so on. When the effect of an inspiring cognatogen ends, the alchemist takes 2 points of ability damage to Strength and Dexterity. The infuse mutagen discovery and the persistent mutagen class ability apply to an inspiring cognatogen.</p><h1>INSPIRED CHEMIST (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Akin to a mindchemist(UM), inspired chemists use a type of cognatogen that, instead of increasing their mental ability scores, grants them an inspiration pool like that of an investigator. This inspiration provides an inspired chemist amazing powers to avoid danger, but takes a toll on both physical power and health.</p><p><b>Inspiring Cognatogen</b>: At 1st level, an inspired chemist learns how to create an inspiring cognatogen, as the inspiring cognatogen discovery. This ability replaces the mutagen class ability. (This means that an inspired chemist cannot create mutagens unless he selects the mutagen(UM) discovery.)</p><p><b>Bonus Feats</b>: An inspired chemist can select Skill Focus (Disable Device, Disguise, Heal, any Knowledge skill, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, or Use Magic Device) in place of a discovery.</p><p><b>Bonus Investigator Talents</b>: An inspired chemist can select any two investigator talents in place of a discovery, but can use these talents only while under the effect of an inspiring cognatogen.</p><p><b>Languages</b>: An inspired chemist can learn three languages in place of a discovery.</p><p><b>Discoveries</b>: The following discoveries complement the inspired chemist archetype: grand inspiring cognatogen, greater inspiring cognatogen, and inspired bomb.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"dLdhCe2Yu99fg6Td"}

Such distinctive, driven individuals are the main characters of countless Pathfinder Roleplaying Game adventures.</p><p>In keeping with the Pathfinder RPG's pedigree of variety and versatility, the <i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide</i>further explores what it means to be a hero. Roleplaying games and fantasy fiction are rife with diverse characters, and the desire to try everything and the ambition to excel beyond the norm inspired many of the new classes and options in this collection. To that end, the <i>Advanced Class Guide</i>opens up a library of new possibilities, helping players of all tastes define their perfect heroes.</p><h1>NAVIGATING THIS BOOK</h1><p>The organization of this book parallels that of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>and the <i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide</i>. Each chapter is made up of similar themes and rules content.</p><p><b>Chapter 1-Classes</b>: The heart of the <i>Advanced Class Guide</i>, this chapter presents 10 new character classes- classic fantasy concepts that inform the new options introduced throughout the book. The new hybrid classes merge core ideas and abilities from existing character classes with a cornucopia of new powers. The result is the largest collection of classes to enter the Pathfinder RPG since the <i>Core Rulebook</i>. The new classes are as follows.</p><p><i>Arcanist</i>: A melding of sorcerer and wizard, the arcanist is an arcane tinkerer and spell-twister, reshaping magic to her whims. Players who like options and variety in their spellcasting should consider this class.</p><p><i>Bloodrager</i>: Blending the wrath of the barbarian with the innate magic of the sorcerer, the bloodrager taps into his rage to create brutal magical effects. Players who enjoy eldritch savagery and want their magic to support them in combat should consider this class.</p><p><i>Brawler</i>: Unifying two of the game's greatest pugilists, the fighter and the monk, the brawler foregoes mysticism and spiritual training to focus on raw physical mastery. Players who want to take on their opponents in fierce hand-to-hand combat should consider this class.</p><p><i>Hunter</i>: Combining the natural skills and animal mastery of the druid and the ranger, the hunter teams up with a devoted animal ally to confront the enemies of the wilds. Players who want an animal companion to be their character's main feature should consider this class.</p><p><i>Investigator</i>: Mixing the alchemist's arcane insight with the shrewdness of the rogue, the investigator uses his knowledge and a wide range of talents to overcome any challenge. Players who enjoy clever characters who are always prepared should consider this class.</p><p><i>Shaman</i>: The occult mysteries of the oracle and the witch combine in the shaman, an enigmatic spirit-speaker who calls upon powers from beyond. Players who seek new routes to eerie divine powers should consider this class.</p><p><i>Skald</i>: The skald blends the passion and relentlessness of the barbarian with the voice of the bard, inspiring his fellows from the front lines. Players who want to both fight alongside allies in battle and bolster their might should consider this class.</p><p><i>Slayer</i>: Deft stalkers of the most dangerous prey, slayers merge the ranger's combat training with the rogue's crippling attacks. Players who seek to deal death from the shadows should consider this class.</p><p><i>Swashbuckler</i>: Bringing together the martial mastery of the fighter and the style of the gunslinger, the swashbuckler uses fast weapons and bewildering melee skills to lay her opponents low. Players who enjoy quick, daring combatants should consider this class.</p><p><i>Warpriest</i>: Adding the fighter's physical might to the force of the cleric's convictions, the warpriest strikes against enemies of his faith. Players who want to play a battle-hardened divine champion should consider this class.</p><p>The chapter concludes with new favored class options available to the races in the <i>Core Rulebook</i>, with benefits they can gain when they take a level in one of these classes. <b>Chapter 2-Archetypes and Class Options</b>: Unlock new powers for your character with dozens of new archetypes and character tools. Along with archetypes for every base class from the <i>Core Rulebook</i>, the <i>Advanced Player's Guide</i>, <i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic</i>, and <i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat</i>, all 10 new classes from Chapter 1 receive full suites of alternate class abilities. New alchemist discoveries, cavalier orders, magus arcana, and other recognizable options pepper this chapter, but the new classes in Chapter 1 also open the door for new concepts to explore. Aside from rage powers that work equally well for both barbarians and skalds, and a new combat style inspired by the slayer's potential expertise with thrown weapons, gunslingers and swashbucklers can now supplement their stylish fighting with dares. Dares are similar to deeds, except they become active when a character runs out of grit or panache, opening up new ways to play for combatants who live on the edge!</p><p><b>Chapter 3-Feats</b>: Dozens of feats fill this chapter, expanding characters' options for general feats, but also for combat feats, style feats, and teamwork feats. Panache feats, which tie into the new swashbuckler class, also make their debut. Fight with flair using all the skill and finesse of the swordmaster's art!</p><p><b>Chapter 4-Spells</b>: This collection contains new spells for every spellcasting class in the game, including additional selections for the bloodrager and the shaman. Shatter magic in your opponent's mind with <i>spellcrash</i>, escape your enemies with <i>fairy ring retreat</i>, or flense foes with the terrifying <i>whip of spiders</i>!</p><p><b>Chapter 5-Gear and Magic Items</b>: Divided into two sections of vital new adventuring aids, this chapter begins with new nonmagical adventuring gear, including a selection of equipment and a range of alchemical remedies, tools, and weapons. The second, larger section presents a host of new magic items, including weapons, armor, rings, rods, staves, and wondrous items. Many of these new items supplement and enhance the abilities of the classes in this book, but adventurers of all stripes are sure to find something to crave.</p><p><b>Chapter 6-Designing Classes</b>: The <i>Core Rulebook</i>gives you details on creating new characters, NPCs, magic items, and more. The <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i>offers an overview of designing new monsters, and <i>Ultimate Magic</i>gives you a crash course on writing and balancing new spells. Now, at long last, this chapter presents tips and tricks for the most challenging game design space in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: the creation of new classes.</p><p>Character classes are among the most expansive, involved, and delicate RPG rules elements to design, with the potential to significantly impact your players \"game enjoyment\" for better or worse. The design philosophies and considerations offered in this chapter apply to more than just the core classes, though: this discussion also covers how to manipulate existing classes to create imaginative new archetypes, as well as how to tailor classes toward specific flavorful or mechanical ends with your own original prestige classes. Don't feel like waiting for Pathfinder's designers to create the class of your dreams? Get out there and make your own! Note that while players shouldn't feel like this chapter is off-limits, they should always check with their GMs before creating and using a class of their own design.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_introduction\">^ Introduction</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1classes\">Classes</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"dXnZCCDMjtCajzbl"}

Proficiency</b>: A slayer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p><p><b>Studied Target (Ex)</b>: A slayer can study an opponent he can see as a move action. The slayer then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, and a +1 bonus on weapon attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by 1. A slayer can maintain these bonuses against only one opponent at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or the slayer studies a new target.</p><p>If a slayer deals sneak attack damage to a target, he can study that target as an immediate action, allowing him to apply his studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon damage roll).</p><p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks and to the DCs of slayer abilities against a studied target increase by 1. In addition, at each such interval, the slayer is able to maintain these bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time. The slayer may discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing him to study another target in its place.</p><p>At 7th level, a slayer can study an opponent as a move or swift action.</p><p><b>Track (Ex)</b>: A slayer adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) to Survival checks made to follow tracks.</p><p><b>Slayer Talents</b>: As a slayer gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer gains one slayer talent. Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once.</p><p>Talents marked with an asterisk * add effects to a slayer's sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which talent to use must be made before the attack roll is made.</p><p><i>Deadly Range (Ex)</i>: A slayer with this talent increases the range at which he can deal sneak attack damage by 10 feet. A slayer can select this talent more than once; its effects stack. A slayer must be at least 4th level before selecting this talent.</p><p><i>Foil Scrutiny</i>: A slayer with this talent is able to obscure his thoughts and intentions. He gains a +2 bonus on all Bluff and Disguise checks, as well as on Will saving throws to resist mind-reading spells and effects (such as <i>detect thoughts</i>and <i>discern lies</i>).</p><p><i>Poison Use (Ex)</i>: The slayer is trained in the use of poison, and cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon.</p><p><i>Ranger Combat Style (Ex)</i>: The slayer selects a ranger combat style (such as archery or two-weapon combat) and gains a combat feat from the 1st-level feat choices for that style. He can choose feats from his chosen combat style, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 6th level, he may select this talent again and add the 6th-level ranger combat feats from his chosen style to the style's feat list. At 10th level, he may select this talent again and add the 10th-level ranger combat feats from his chosen style to the style's feat list.</p><p><i>Rogue Talent</i>: A slayer can select one of the following rogue talents in place of a slayer talent: bleeding attack*, camouflage(APG), combat trick, fast stealth, finesse rogue, firearm training(UC), grit(UC), hard to fool(APG), lasting poison(APG), powerful sneak(APG), rogue crawl, slow reactions*, snap shot(APG), sniper's eye(APG), surprise attack, swift poison(APG), terrain mastery(UC), trap spotter, unwitting ally(UC), or weapon training. Any talent effects based on rogue level use the slayer's class level. If the rogue talent has a prerequisite, the slayer must meet the prerequisite before taking that rogue talent. This talent can be selected multiple times; each time, it grants the slayer a new rogue talent.</p><p><i>Slowing Strike</i>* <i>(Ex)</i>: An opponent damaged by the slayer's sneak attack has its speeds halved for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude saving throw negates this effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 the slayer's level + the slayer's Intelligence modifier). Against creatures with multiple types of movement, the slayer must choose which movement type to affect. If the slayer affects a creature's flight movement, its maneuverability is reduced by one step; if it's airborne at the time, it falls unless it succeeds at a DC 10 Fly check. If the slayer targets a creature already affected by this ability, its speed and maneuverability are not further reduced; the slayer may either extend the duration of that effect by 1d4 rounds or choose another movement type to affect (keeping track of the duration of each affected movement separately).</p><p><i>Trapfinding</i>: The slayer gains Disable Device as a class skill. The slayer also gains the trapfinding and trap sense rogue abilities, using his slayer level as his effective rogue level.</p><p><b>Sneak Attack</b>: At 3rd level, if a slayer catches an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The slayer's attack deals extra damage anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the slayer flanks his target. This additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the slayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p><p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, a whip, or an unarmed strike), a slayer can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty.</p><p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer cannot use sneak attack while striking a creature that has concealment.</p><p><b>Stalker (Ex)</b>: At 7th level, a slayer gains his studied target bonus on Disguise, Intimidate, and Stealth checks against his studied opponent.</p><p><b>Advanced Talents</b>: At 10th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a slayer can select one of the following advanced talents in place of a slayer talent.</p><p><i>Assassinate (Ex)</i>: A slayer with this advanced talent can kill foes that are unable to defend themselves. To attempt to assassinate a target, the slayer must first study his target for 1 round as a standard action. On the following round, if the slayer makes a sneak attack against the target and that target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly killing the target. This attempt automatically fails if the target recognizes the slayer as an enemy. If the sneak attack is successful, the target must attempt a Fortitude saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the slayer's level + the slayer's Intelligence modifier. If the target fails this save, it dies; otherwise, the target takes the sneak attack damage as normal and is then immune to that slayer's assassinate ability for 24 hours.</p><p><i>Rogue Advanced Talents and Ninja Master Tricks</i>: A slayer can select one of the following rogue advanced talents or ninja master tricks in place of a slayer advanced talent: deadly sneak(APG), evasion(UC), feat, hunter's surprise(APG), knock-out blow(APG), master of disguise(APG), opportunist, or stealthy sniper(APG). A slayer can select multiple rogue advanced talents or ninja master tricks by taking this slayer advanced talent multiple times, but can't select the same one more than once.</p><p><i>Slayer Camouflage (Ex)</i>: A slayer can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment. A slayer must have the terrain mastery(UC) talent to select this talent.</p><p><i>Woodland Stride (Ex)</i>: A slayer with this talent may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Terrain that is enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affects the slayer as normal.</p><p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex)</b>: At 11th level, a slayer can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. When moving at up to twice his normal speed while tracking, he takes only a -10 penalty instead of the normal -20.</p><p><b>Slayer's Advance (Ex)</b>: At 13th level, a slayer can move up to twice his base speed once per day as a move action. He can use Stealth as part of this movement, but takes a -10 penalty on his check for doing so. At 17th level, he can use this ability twice per day.</p><p><b>Quarry (Ex)</b>: At 14th level, a slayer can as a standard action denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a slayer can take 10 on his Survival checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he gains a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats against his quarry are automatically confirmed. A slayer can have no more than one quarry at a time, and the creature must be one of the slayer's studied targets. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the slayer sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after 1 hour.</p><p><b>Improved Quarry (Ex)</b>: At 19th level, the slayer's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 when using Survival to track his quarry while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p><p><b>Master Slayer (Ex)</b>: At 20th level, the slayer becomes a master at capturing or killing his studied targets. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a studied target at his full attack bonus, choosing one of the following effects: kill, knock unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6 rounds. If the attack succeeds, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or suffer the additional effect. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the slayer's level + the slayer's Intelligence modifier. Whether or not the target succeeds, it cannot be targeted by this ability again (by any slayer) for 24 hours.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1classes\">^Classes</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">Archetypes and Class Options</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"duIvpybTrFfE9Syt"}

They grant abilities and benefits in certain situations.</p><h1>Types of Feats</h1><p>Though most of the feats presented in this chapter are general and have no special rules governing them, some feats belong to one or more categories of feats that share special rules. A feat's type or types appear in parentheses after the feat's name. The following types of feats can be found in this chapter.</p><h1>Combat Feats</h1><p>Brawlers, fighters, gunslingers, swashbucklers, and warpriests can select combat feats as bonus feats. Members of other classes can take combat feats, provided they meet the prerequisites.</p><h1>Panache Feats</h1><p>Panache feats interact with the swashbuckler's panache class ability or the panache granted by the Amateur Swashbuckler feat (see page 141). Swashbucklers can take panache feats as bonus feats.</p><h1>Style Feats</h1><p>Style feats were introduced in <i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat</i>. The style feats presented in this chapter are based on fighting styles more appropriate to the brawler's rough-and-tumble combat disciplines.</p><p>As a swift action, you can enter the stance employed by the fighting style that a style feat embodies. Although you cannot use a style feat before combat begins, the style you are in persists until either you use a swift action to switch styles or the end of the combat encounter, whichever occurs first. You can use a feat that has a style feat as a prerequisite only while you are in the stance of the associated style.</p><p>The styles presented in this book follow, along with specific feat paths-feats that complement each style.</p><p><b>Grabbing Style</b>: This discipline is a wrestling and grappling style that favors powerful one-handed grabs, fast repositioning of those grabbed, and the ability to move and damage one or two opponents.</p><p><i>Feat Path</i>: Grabbing Style, Grabbing Drag, Grabbing Master.</p><p><b>Jabbing Style</b>: This style favors rapid punches and kicks, typically while the fighter circles her foe. Many of these land in the same area, delivering more pain with each successive hit, or in debilitating areas of the body.</p><p><i>Feat Path</i>: Jabbing Style, Jabbing Dancer, Jabbing Master.</p><p><b>Pummeling Style</b>: Powerful and seemingly wild haymaker punches and extended kicks are the hallmark of this style. Deeply rooted in its martial philosophy is the concept that landing one mighty strike in the right area will send an opponent sprawling.</p><p><i>Feat Path</i>: Pummeling Style, Pummeling Bully, Pummeling Charge.</p><h1>Teamwork Feats</h1><p>Teamwork feats grant significant bonuses, but they function only under specific circumstances. In most cases, these feats require an ally with the same feat to have a specific position on the battlefield. Teamwork feats provide no benefits if the given conditions are not met. Allies who are paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise unable to act do not count for the purposes of these feats. Cavaliers, hunters, and inquisitors have special class abilities that allow them to use teamwork feats even if their allies don't have those feats.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">^ Feats</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter4spells\">Spells</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"e2vEKWSeqtJrOAZq"}

For them, it can be hard to find a balance between abilities offered by disparate classes. Hybrid classes solve this dilemma by blending features from two classes, adding rules to make them work seamlessly together.</p><p><b>Parent Classes</b>: Each of the following classes draws upon two classes to form the basis of its theme. While a character can multiclass with these parent classes, doing so usually results in redundant abilities. Such abilities don't stack unless specified. If a class feature allows the character to make a one-time choice (such as a bloodline), that choice must match similar choices made by the parent classes and vice-versa (such as selecting the same bloodline).</p><h1>CLASSES</h1><p>The ten new classes presented in this book are all hybrids of two existing classes from the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook, Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide</i>, and <i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat</i>. The new classes are as follows.</p><p><b>Arcanist</b>: Blending the power of the sorcerer with the versatility of the wizard, the arcanist draws upon a reservoir of power to bend magic to her will.</p><p><b>Bloodrager</b>: Fusing the frenzy of the barbarian with the bloodline might of the sorcerer, the bloodrager calls upon innate power to give himself extraordinary abilities.</p><p><b>Brawler</b>: Focusing on hand-to-hand combat, the brawler mixes the martial artistry of the monk with the specialist training of the fighter.</p><p><b>Hunter</b>: Though both the druid and ranger can have animal companions, the hunter takes this bond to the next level, forming a deadly duo with her savage ally.</p><p><b>Investigator</b>: With the rogue's cunning complemented by the alchemist's magical talent, the investigator is a peerless problem solver.</p><p><b>Shaman</b>: Calling on the divine power of the oracle and the hexes of a witch, the shaman communes with her spirit animal to unleash doom upon her foes.</p><p><b>Skald</b>: Sharing fury through song and deed, the skald takes the rage that lives in the heart of the barbarian and inspires it in others using the performances of the bard.</p><p><b>Slayer</b>: Mixing the precise strikes of the rogue with the special training of the ranger, the slayer hunts down his foes with ruthless efficiency.</p><p><b>Swashbuckler</b>: Combining the prowess of the fighter with the determination of the gunslinger, the swashbuckler is an acrobatic melee combatant.</p><p><b>Warpriest</b>: Blending the cleric's divine might and the fighter's martial skills, the warpriest brings the fight to the enemies of his faith.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1classes\">^Classes</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">Archetypes and Class Options</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"e5pk95ZXZfwV37dK"}

Some do this for a bounty, some to cleanse the world of the filth of the undead, and some because it's what they're good at. The most fearsome hunt and kill because they enjoy it.</p><h1>COMBAT STYLE</h1><p>The following combat style is available to rangers, slayers, and other classes that can use ranger combat styles.</p><p><b>Thrown Weapon</b>: If the character selects thrown weapon, he can choose from the following list whenever he gains a combat style feat: Distance Thrower(UC), Precise Shot, Quick Draw, Two-Weapon Fighting. At 6th level, he adds Close- Quarters Thrower(UC) and False Opening(UC) to the list. At 10th level, he adds Pinpoint Targeting and Shot on the Run to the list.</p><h1>BOUNTY HUNTER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Whether tasked with bringing in wanted criminals or paid to drag debtors back to their loan sharks, bounty hunters are valued for their ability to capture targets alive.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: A bounty hunter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons plus the aklys, bolas, dan bong, lasso, and net. Bounty hunters are proficient with light armor, light shields, and bucklers, but not with heavy shields or tower shields. This ability replaces the slayer's weapon and armor proficiency.</p><p><b>Dirty Trick (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, anytime a bounty hunter is able to deal sneak attack damage to a studied target, he can instead attempt to hamper the target. The bounty hunter must declare that he's using this ability before the attack roll is made. If the attack hits, it deals damage normally, but instead of rolling sneak attack damage, the bounty hunter can attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver against the studied target as a free action, adding 1 to the combat maneuver check for each die of the bounty hunter's sneak attack damage. This combat maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity. This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 2nd level.</p><p><b>Submission Hold (Ex)</b>: At 6th level, when a bounty hunter attempts a grapple combat maneuver check to deal damage, he can choose to add his sneak attack damage to the grapple damage for that attack. He takes a -5 penalty on the combat maneuver check if he does this. This sneak attack damage is nonlethal damage, unless the bounty hunter is able to deal normal damage with a grapple and chooses to do so. This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 6th level.</p><p><b>Incapacitate (Ex)</b>: At 10th level, a bounty hunter can incapacitate a studied target. This ability functions as the assassinate slayer talent, except instead of killing the target, the bounty hunter's successful attack knocks the target unconscious for 1d6 rounds unless it succeeds at its saving throw. If the target does succeed, it still takes the sneak attack damage as normal, but the damage is nonlethal, and the target is immune to that slayer's incapacitate ability for 24 hours. This ability replaces the advanced slayer talent gained at 10th level.</p><p><b>Slayer Talents</b>: The following slayer talents (and rogue talents) complement the bounty hunter archetype: camouflage(APG), fast stealth, hard to fool(APG), slowing strike (see page 53), snap shot(APG), surprise attack, and terrain mastery(UC).</p><p><b>Advanced Slayer Talents</b>: The following advanced slayer talents (and advanced rogue talents) complement the bounty hunter archetype: hunter's surprise(APG), knock-out blow(APG), master of disguise(APG), and woodland stride (see page 55).</p><h1>CLEANER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>A cleaner is responsible for destroying or removing incriminating evidence from a crime scene, disposing of corpses and eliminating witnesses as necessary to make a crime look like an accident or a mere disappearance.</p><p><b>Deceitful</b>: At 1st level, a cleaner becomes skilled at deceiving others, and gains Deceitful as a bonus feat. This ability replaces track.</p><p><b>Without a Trace (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, a cleaner is able to study a location, conceal evidence, and hide in or extricate himself quickly from that location. Studying a location takes 1 minute for each 10-foot square. Once he has studied an area, the cleaner can attempt a Disguise check to alter evidence or a Stealth check to conceal evidence (by cleaning up bloodstains, obscuring footprints, moving a dead body, and so on). Altering a location takes 1d3 x 10 minutes of work per 10-foot square. Anyone attempting to determine what actually happened in that area must succeed at an opposed Perception check against the result of the cleaner's Disguise or Stealth check (cleaner's choice) or accept the altered scene as truth. The cleaner gains a +4 bonus on this check, on Sleight of Hand checks to hide objects from that location on his person, and on Stealth checks to hide within or escape from that location. The benefits of this ability last as long as the location remains unaltered (except by the cleaner). This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 4th level.</p><p><b>Misdirection (Sp)</b>: At 7th level, a cleaner can cast <i>misdirection</i>on himself at will. This benefit lasts until the cleaner uses the ability again or ends the effect as a standard action. This ability replaces stalker.</p><p><b>Slayer Talents</b>: The following slayer talents (and rogue talents) complement the cleaner archetype: camouflage(APG), fast stealth, foil scrutiny (see page 53), rogue crawl, surprise attack, and terrain mastery(UC).</p><p><b>Advanced Slayer Talents</b>: The following advanced slayer talents (and advanced rogue talents) complement the cleaner archetype: assassinate (see page 54), knock-out blow(APG), master of disguise(APG), and slayer camouflage (see page 55).</p><h1>CUTTHROAT (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Street-smart and extremely resourceful, cutthroats stalk city streets and alleyways, preying on those unfortunate enough to catch their eye. More opportunists than careful planners, they don't care who they victimize, and they take advantage of whatever circumstances put them near a suitable target.</p><p><b>Class Skills</b>: A cutthroat gains Diplomacy, Knowledge (nobility), and Linguistics as class skills, but does not gain Knowledge (dungeoneering), Knowledge (geography), or Survival as class skills.</p><p><b>Street Stalker (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a cutthroat selects Acrobatics, Climb, or Knowledge (local) . Once selected, this skill cannot be changed. When in urban environments, the cutthroat adds 1/2 his slayer level (minimum 1) to checks attempted with this skill. This ability replaces track.</p><p><b>Opportune Target (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, a cutthroat who catches a foe by surprise can quickly study that foe to find its weaknesses. If a cutthroat can act in the surprise round, once during that surprise round he can study a foe as a free action (instead of a move action) and select it as his studied target. This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 2nd level.</p><p><b>Stab and Grab (Ex)</b>: At 6th level, as a swift action a cutthroat can attempt a steal combat maneuver against a dead or unconscious target or a studied target he has just confirmed a critical hit against. A dead or unconscious opponent takes a -10 penalty to its CMD against this maneuver. This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 6th level. <b>Slayer Talents</b>: The following slayer talents (and rogue talents) complement the cutthroat archetype: fast stealth, poison use (see page 53), slowing strike (see page 53), surprise attack, and terrain mastery(UC).</p><p><b>Advanced Slayer Talents</b>: The following advanced slayer talents (and advanced rogue talents) complement the cutthroat archetype: assassinate (see page 54), knock-out blow(APG), opportunist, and slayer camouflage (see page 55).</p><h1>DELIVERER (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Also known as a divine assassin, god's blade, or wrath-bringer, a deliverer is a weapon chosen by a god to punish those who have committed an affront to that deity. Evil deities are more likely to use assassins than deliverers, but some good deities use deliverers to deal with problems of a subtler nature than a cleric, inquisitor, paladin, or warpriest can typically handle.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: A deliverer is proficient with his deity's favored weapon, in addition to the slayer's normal weapon proficiencies. This ability alters the slayer's weapon and armor proficiency.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Determined Zeal (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, a deliverer shrugs off attempts by his moral opposite to control or kill him. In any round when the deliverer attacks an opponent whose alignment is at least two steps away from his own (such as a lawful good deliverer fighting a chaotic good or lawful evil foe, or a neutral foe with no other alignment components), he gains a +2 bonus on Will saving throws against that opponent's abilities, as well as the benefit of the Diehard feat until the end of his next turn. This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 2nd level.</p><p><b>True Believer (Ex)</b>: At 6th level, a deliverer can perform his divine duty even when mortally wounded. In any round in which he gains the benefits of Determined Zeal, he isn't staggered from having negative hit points, nor does he automatically lose 1 hit point per round. This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 6th level.</p><p><b>Divine Anathema (Ex)</b>: At 10th level, as a free action a deliverer can declare a studied target to be his divine anathema. The studied target's alignment must be at least two steps away from that of the deliverer. Against this target, the deliverer's attacks deal an additional 2d6 points of damage; this damage is directly from divine power and does not stack with the bonus damage from a <i>holy</i>or <i>unholy</i>weapon, or a weapon with a similar weapon special ability or effect. A deliverer can have only one divine anathema at a time. This ability replaces the advanced slayer talent gained at 10th level.</p><p><b>Slayer Talents</b>: The following slayer talents (and rogue talents) complement the deliverer archetype: combat trick, finesse rogue, foil scrutiny (see page 53), terrain mastery(UC), trap spotter, and trapfinding (see page 54).</p><p><b>Advanced Slayer Talents</b>: The following advanced slayer talents (and advanced rogue talents) complement the deliverer archetype: assassinate (see page 54), evasion(UC), hunter's surprise(APG), and master of disguise(APG).</p><p><b>Ex-Deliverers</b>: A deliverer who grossly violates the code of conduct required by his deity loses all class features granted by this archetype, except for the weapon proficiencies. (He does not gain the slayer class abilities that the archetype replaces.) He cannot thereafter gain levels as a deliverer of that deity until he atones for his deeds (see the <i>atonement</i>spell description).</p><h1>GRAVE WARDEN (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>While paladins and inquisitors use their connection with the divine to fight undead hordes and other horrors of the night, a grave warden relies on knowledge, skill with weapons, and tenacity to put an end to these night-born terrors.</p><p><b>Holy Water Sprinkler (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, a grave warden can draw a flask of holy water as if it were a weapon (and can thus use the Quick Draw feat to draw flasks of holy water). As a swift action, he can open a flask of holy water and pour it onto a held or adjacent melee weapon. If the weapon hits an undead creature before the end of the grave warden's next turn, the undead takes damage as if it took a direct hit from the holy water, in addition to the damage from the weapon, if any. This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 2nd level.</p><p><b>Death Ward (Sp)</b>: At 7th level, a grave warden learns to perform a short ritual that grants the benefits of <i>death ward</i>, using his slayer level as his caster level. Performing this ritual takes 1 minute and uses 4 flasks of holy water. The grave warden can protect only himself with this ability. This ability replaces stalker.</p><p><b>Dustbringer (Ex)</b>: At 10th level, a grave warden can slay a studied undead opponent. This ability functions as the assassinate advanced slayer talent, except it requires a successful Will saving throw instead of a successful Fortitude save, affects only undead, and destroys the target instead of killing it. If the target succeeds at its saving throw, it becomes immune to that grave warden's dustbringer ability for 24 hours. This ability replaces the advanced slayer talent gained at 10th level.</p><p><b>Slayer Talents</b>: The following slayer talents (and rogue talents) complement the deliverer archetype: fast stealth, finesse rogue, surprise attack, swift poison(APG), terrain mastery(UC), trap spotter, and unwitting ally(UC).</p><p><b>Advanced Slayer Talents</b>: The following advanced slayer talents (and advanced rogue talents) complement the grave warden archetype: hunter's surprise(APG) and slayer camouflage (see page 55).</p><h1>SNIPER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Whether it's with a bullet from a sling, a quarrel from a crossbow, or even an expertly thrown dagger, the sniper ensures that a single shot disables his target.</p><p><b>Accuracy (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a sniper halves all range increment penalties when making ranged attacks with a bow, a crossbow, or a firearm. This ability replaces track.</p><p><b>Deadly Sniper (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, when the sniper makes an attack against a target who is within his weapon's first range increment and completely unaware of his presence, that attack ignores the 30 foot range limit on ranged sneak attacks, and if it is a sneak attack, he adds his sniper level as a bonus on his sneak attack damage roll. After this first attack, the target is aware of the sniper's presence.</p><p><b>Slayer Talents</b>: The following slayer talents (and rogue talents) complement the sniper archetype: camouflage(APG), snap shot(APG), sniper's eye(APG), and weapon training.</p><p><b>Advanced Slayer Talents</b>: The following advanced slayer talents (and advanced rogue talents) complement the sniper archetype: deadly sneak(APG), master of disguise(APG), and stealthy sniper(APG).</p><h1>STYGIAN SLAYER (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>A stygian slayer crawls out of the darkest shadows to strike fear into the hearts of civilized folk. He's a merciless killer who can control a sliver of magic, allowing him to arrive unseen, commit murder, and depart without detection.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: A stygian slayer is proficient with light armor, but not with medium armor, heavy armor, or any kind of shield (including tower shields). This ability replaces the slayer's armor proficiency.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Invisibility (Sp)</b>: At 4th level, a stygian slayer can cast <i>invisibility</i>once per day, using his slayer level as his caster level. The slayer uses his Intelligence modifier for concentration checks when using this ability. The slayer can use this ability an additional time per day at 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter. This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 4th level.</p><p><b>Spell Use</b>: At 7th level, a stygian slayer is able to use spell completion and spell trigger items as if he were an arcane caster with these spells on his spell list: <i>darkness</i>, <i>forced quiet</i>(UM), <i>modify memory</i>, <i>nondetection</i>, <i>obscuring mist</i>, <i>phantom steed</i>, <i>shadow walk</i>, and wizard spells of the illusion school of spell level 0 through 4th. The slayer uses his class level as his caster level for this ability. This ability replaces stalker.</p><p><b>Shadowy Mist Form (Sp)</b>: At 10th level, a stygian slayer can transform into an inky black cloud of mist. This ability functions as <i>gaseous form</i>, except it also obscures vision as <i>fog cloud</i>. The slayer can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to his level. The duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be used in 1-minute increments. This ability replaces the advanced slayer talent gained at 10th level.</p><p><b>Slayer Talents</b>: The following slayer talents (and rogue talents) complement the stygian slayer archetype: bleeding attack, lasting poison(APG), poison use (see page 53), powerful sneak(APG), rogue crawl, slow reactions, surprise attack, and swift poison(APG).</p><p><b>Advanced Slayer Talents</b>: The following advanced slayer talents (and advanced rogue talent) complement the stygian slayer archetype: assassinate (see page 54), hunter's surprise(APG), and slayer camouflage (see page 55).</p><h1>VANGUARD (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Vanguards are battlefield commanders who focus on brutally effective combat strategies and lead their allies to bloody victory. Quick to react to danger, a vanguard is a valuable scout, a capable officer, and a skilled tactician.</p><p><b>Lookout (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a vanguard adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) to initiative checks. This ability replaces track.</p><p><b>Tactician (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, a vanguard receives a teamwork feat as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat. Once per day as a standard action, the vanguard can grant one of his teamwork feats to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear him. Allies retain the use of this bonus feat for 3 rounds plus 1 round for every 2 levels the vanguard possesses.</p><p>Allies do not need to meet the prerequisites of this bonus feat. Whenever the vanguard is able to select a new slayer talent, he can instead choose to gain an additional use per day of this ability. This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 2nd level.</p><p><b>Vanguard's Bond (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, a vanguard forms a bond with his fighting companions. As a move action, he can choose one of his current studied targets and grant half his studied target bonus against that target to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the slayer's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy or studied target bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher. This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 4th level.</p><p><b>Ever Ready (Ex)</b>: At 7th level, a vanguard is never considered an unaware combatant (<i>Core Rulebook</i>178) and is always able to act in the surprise round. The vanguard is still flat-footed in the surprise round until he acts. This ability replaces stalker.</p><p><b>Slayer Talents</b>: The following slayer talents (and rogue talents) complement the vanguard archetype: combat trick, finesse rogue, hard to fool(APG), rogue crawl, surprise attack, terrain mastery(UC), and weapon training.</p><p><b>Advanced Slayer Talents</b>: The following advanced slayer talents (and advanced rogue talents) complement the vanguard archetype: feat, opportunist, slayer camouflage (see page 55), and unwitting ally(UC).</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"eXbbcn9tdXe4WM9o"}
{"name":"Warpriest Archetype","permission":{"default":0,"JgpLZkPryhl1EFab":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_zrrxjaps56","path":"Pathfinder RPG - Advanced Class Guide Reference Library#/CF_SEP/ADVANCED CLASS GUIDE#/CF_SEP/CHAPTER 2: ARCHETYPES AND CLASS OPTIONS","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\"></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>While paladins are defenders of all that is lawful and good, a warpriest is the living embodiment of a faithful warrior. The warpriest comes in a multitude of forms: some bear the shining armor and upright stance usually associated with paladins, while others serve as cult leaders, exorcise harmful magic effects, or forge the weapons of the faith.</p><h1>CHAMPION OF THE FAITH (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Champions of the faith are crusaders who use the power of their divine patron to annihilate the faith's enemies.</p><p><b>Chosen Alignment</b>: At 1st level, a champion of the faith must select one of the following as his chosen alignment: chaos, evil, good, or law. This choice must be one of the alignments shared by the champion of the faith and his deity. Champions of the faith who are neutral with no other alignment components (or whose deity is) can choose any of the above alignments for this purpose. Additionally, a champion of the faith must select the blessing corresponding to his chosen alignment, even if it's not on his deity's list of domains.</p><p>His chosen alignment's opposite is referred to as his opposed alignment. Good and evil oppose one another, just as law and chaos oppose one another. This alters alignment.</p><p><b>Sacred Weapon (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a champion of the faith gains the sacred weapon class feature as normal. However, this ability does not grant the 4th-level ability to enhance the champion of the faith's weapon with divine power, nor does it grant any subsequent increases to that ability. Instead, at 4th level, any sacred weapon wielded by a champion of the faith counts as having his chosen alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p>At 12th level, once per day as a swift action, a champion of the faith can enhance any one sacred weapon with a weapon special ability based on his chosen alignment (<i>anarchic</i>for chaos, <i>unholy</i>for evil, <i>holy</i>for good, or <i>axiomatic</i>for law). This effect lasts for 1 minute. He can use this ability one additional time per day at 16th and 20th levels.</p><p>This ability alters sacred weapon.</p><p><b>Detect Alignment (Sp)</b>: At 3rd level, a champion of the faith can detect his opposed alignment. As a move action, the champion of the faith can focus on a single item or creature within 60 feet and determine whether it possesses his opposed alignment, as <i>detect chaos/evil/good/law</i>, learning the strength of the aura as if he had studied it for 3 rounds. The champion of the faith does not detect the alignment of any other object or creature when using this ability in this way. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 3rd level.</p><p><b>Smite (Su)</b>: At 4th level, a champion of the faith can focus his powers against his chosen foes. As a swift action, the champion of the faith chooses one target within sight that is of his opposed alignment. The champion of the faith adds his Charisma bonus to his attack rolls and adds extra damage equal to his warpriest level to all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target of his smite is an outsider with a subtype corresponding to his opposed alignment, the extra damage on the first successful attack increases to twice his warpriest level. Regardless of the target, smite attacks automatically bypass any damage reduction the target possesses.</p><p>In addition, while his smite is in effect, the champion of the faith gains a Deflection bonus equal to his Charisma bonus to his AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the smite targets a creature that's not of the champion of the faith's opposed alignment, the smite is wasted with no effect.</p><p>The smite effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the champion of the faith regains spells. The champion of the faith can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 4th (to a maximum of five times per day at 20th level). Using this ability consumes two uses of fervor.</p><p>This ability replaces channel energy.</p><h1>CULT LEADER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Referred to as fanatics, lunatics, or obsessives, cultists see themselves as genuine devotees of their deity. And the hierarchs of those devotees, the cult leaders, are the most fanatical of them all. Cult leaders are known for turning reasonable hearts toward corrupted teachings and striking at those that get in the way of their agenda.</p><p><b>Class Skills</b>: The cult leader's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Slight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Stealth (Dex). These skills replace the warpriest's class skills.</p><p><b>Skill Ranks per Level</b>: 4 + Int modifier.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: Cult leaders are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, and short sword, as well as the favored weapon of their deity. They are proficient with light armor and light shields. The cult leader does not gain Weapon Focus as a bonus feat as a warpriest normally would. This ability replaces the warpriest's weapon and armor proficiency.</p><p><b>Well-Hidden (Ex)</b>: A cult leader gains a +2 bonus on Disguise checks and Stealth checks. This ability replaces focus weapon.</p><p><b>Sneak Attack (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, a cult leader gains the sneak attack ability, as the rogue class feature. If he already has sneak attack from another class, the extra damage from the classes that grant sneak attack stack for the purpose of determining the sneak attack's extra damage dice. This extra damage is 1d6 at 3rd level and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. This ability replaces the bonus feats gained at 3rd, 9th, and 15th levels.</p><p><b>Enthrall (Sp)</b>: At 4th level, a cult leader can cast <i>enthrall</i>. Using this ability consumes two uses of fervor. This ability replaces channel energy.</p><p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Su)</b>: At 12th level, a cult leader can use the Stealth skill even while being observed. As long as he is within 10 feet of an area of dim light, a cult leader can hide himself from view in the open without having anything to actually hide behind. He cannot, however, hide in his own shadow. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 12th level.</p><h1>DISENCHANTER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>While many warpriests focus on threats to the body, the disenchanter focuses on dangers to the mind and the soul. Using the power of his patron, the disenchanter seeks to keep the powers of magic in check.</p><p><b>Bonus Feats (Ex)</b>: Whenever a disenchanter gains a bonus feat, he must choose from the following list: Great Fortitude, Improved Counterspell, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Skill Focus (Spellcraft), or Spell Focus (abjuration). At 6th level, he adds the following feats to this list: Dispel Synergy(UC), Improved Great Fortitude, Improved Iron Will, and Improved Lightning Reflexes. At 12th level, he adds the following feats to this list: Destructive Dispel(UC), Dispelling Critical(UC), Parry Spell(APG), and Ray Shield(APG). He does not need to meet the prerequisites for these feats. This ability alters bonus feats.</p><p><b>Mystic Interference (Su)</b>: At 4th level, a disenchanter can channel a burst of pure abjuration magic to grant protection to himself and all allies with 30 feet. Affected creatures receive a +1 bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities for a number of rounds equal to his warpriest level. This is a sacred bonus if the warpriest is good-aligned or able to spontaneously cast cure spells, and a profane bonus if the warpriest is evil-aligned or able to spontaneously cast inflict spells. Using this ability consumes two uses of fervor. At 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the bonus granted by mystic interference increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). This ability replaces channel energy.</p><p><b>Banish Enchantment (Su)</b>: At 6th level, a disenchanter learns to focus his mystic interference. As a standard action, he can consume two uses of his fervor ability to target a single creature within 30 feet with a targeted <i>dispel magic</i>. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 6th level.</p><h1>DIVINE COMMANDER (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Some warpriests are called to lead great armies and face legions of foes. These divine commanders live for war and fight for glory. Their hearts quicken at battle cries, and they charge forth with their deity's symbol held high. They assume the mantle of leadership to promote the agenda of their faith, and gather armies of devoted followers willing to give their lives for the cause. (Several of the divine commander's abilities reference and interact with the mass combat rules in <i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign</i>.)</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Mount (Ex)</b>: A divine commander gains the service of a loyal and trusty steed to carry her into battle. This mount functions as a druid's animal companion, using the divine commander's level as her effective druid level. The creature must be one that she is capable of riding and must be suitable as a mount. A Medium divine commander can select a camel or a horse. A Small divine commander can select a pony or a wolf, and can also select a boar or a dog if she is at least 4th level. (The GM might approve other animals as suitable mounts.)</p><p>A divine commander does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding this mount. The mount is always considered combat trained, and it begins play with Light Armor Proficiency as a bonus feat. A divine commander's mount does not gain the share spells special ability. If a divine commander's mount dies, she can find another mount to serve her after 1 week of mourning. This new mount does not gain the link, evasion, devotion, or improved evasion special abilities until the next time the divine commander gains a level. This ability replaces blessings.</p><p><b>Battle Tactician (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, a divine commander gains a teamwork feat as a bonus feat. She must meet the prerequisites of this feat. As a standard action, the divine commander can grant this feat to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear her. Allies retain the use of this bonus feat for 4 rounds, plus 1 round for every 2 levels beyond 3rd that the divine commander possesses. Allies do not need to meet the prerequisites of this bonus feat. The divine commander can use this ability once per day at 3rd level, plus one additional time per day at 9th and 15th levels. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 3rd level.</p><p><b>Blessed Mount (Su)</b>: At 6th level, a divine commander's mount is blessed by her deity. The divine commander's mount gains either the celestial, the entropic, the fiendish, or the resolute template, matching the alignment of the warpriest's deity (celestial for good, entropic for chaotic, fiendish for evil, or resolute for lawful). If deity's alignment includes more than one of these components, the divine commander can select which of the two templates the mount receives. Once the type of template is selected, it can't be changed.</p><p>If the divine commander's deity is neutral with no other alignment components, the mount receives spell resistance equal to the divine commander's level + 5, as well as resistance 10 against two types of energy damage of the divine commander's choice.</p><p>If a divine commander's mount dies and the divine commander finds another mount, the new mount becomes a blessed mount the next time the divine commander gains a level. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 6th level.</p><p><b>Greater Battle Tactician (Ex)</b>: At 12th level, the divine commander gains an additional teamwork feat as a bonus feat. She must meet the prerequisites for this feat. The divine commander can grant this feat to her allies using the battle tactician ability. Additionally, using the battle tactician ability is now a swift action for her. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 12th level.</p><p><b>Bless Army (Su)</b>: At 15th level, a divine commander can raise her holy symbol high and give a blessing to the army she is leading. The divine commander's army gains a +1 bonus to the army's OM and DV (<i>Ultimate Campaign</i>235). This is a sacred bonus if the warpriest is good-aligned or able to spontaneously cast cure spells, and it is a profane bonus if the warpriest is evil-aligned or able to spontaneously cast inflict spells. Using this ability requires the divine commander to expend two uses of fervor. This bonus lasts for one battle, and it must be performed during the tactics phase of the battle. If this is performed when a mass combat is not imminent, the fervor is expended without granting any bonus. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 15th level.</p><h1>FORGEPRIEST (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Armorers of exquisite skill, forgepriests take inspiration from their deity to produce the most perfect weapons and armor they can, the better to equip the armies of the faithful. <b>Blessings</b>: A forgepriest selects only one blessing. This ability alters the blessings class feature.</p><p><b>Smith's Spells</b>: A forgepriest adds the following spells to his spell list: 1st-<i>jury rig</i>(UC), <i>shield</i>; 2nd-<i>heat metal</i>, <i>shatter</i>; 3rd-<i>keen edge</i>, <i>quench</i>, <i>versatile weapon</i>; 4th-<i>wreath of blades</i>(UC); 5th-<i>fabricate</i>, <i>major creation</i>; 6th-<i>mage's sword</i>.</p><p><b>Forge Mastery (Ex)</b>: A 2nd level, the forgepriest adds a bonus equal to half his level to all Craft checks to make metal items, armor, and weapons.</p><p><b>Bonus Feats</b>: A forgepriest can select item creation feats in addition to combat feats when he gains a bonus feat. This ability alters bonus feats.</p><p><b>Craft Magic Arms and Armor</b>At 3rd level, a forgepriest gains Craft Magic Arms and Armor as a bonus feat. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 3rd level.</p><p><b>Creator's Bond (Su)</b>: At 4th level, when a forgepriest uses his sacred weapon ability with an item he created personally, he can expend two uses of fervor to increase the bonus granted by 1. Once the forgepriest has the sacred armor ability, he can also use this ability in conjunction with that. This ability replaces channel energy.</p><p><b>Heat of the Forge (Su)</b>: At 6th level, a forgepriest gains fire resistance 5. At 13th level, this resistance increases to 10. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 6th level.</p><h1>SACRED FIST (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Sacred fists leave behind armor and shield and instead rely on their fists and whatever protection their deity grants.</p><p><b>Class Skills</b>: The sacred fist's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Swim (Str). This replaces the warpriest's class skills.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: Sacred fists are proficient with the club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shortspear, short sword, shuriken, siangham, sling, and spear. Sacred fists are not proficient with any armor or shields. When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a sacred fist loses his AC bonus and flurry of blows. This ability replaces the warpriest's weapon and armor proficiency.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>AC Bonus (Su)</b>: A deity protects her sacred fist as long as he is unarmored and unencumbered. A sacred fist adds his Wisdom modifier (minimum 0) to his AC and his CMD. In addition, a sacred fist gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels thereafter (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p><p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the sacred fist is flat-footed. He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears any armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load. This counts as the monk ability of the same name, and the sacred fist's warpriest levels stack with monk levels for determining the benefits.</p><p><b>Flurry of Blows (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a sacred fist can make a flurry of blows attack as a full-attack action. This ability works like the monk ability of the same name, except the sacred fist's attack bonus from warpriest levels does not count as his warpriest level. This ability replaces sacred weapon.</p><p><b>Unarmed Strike</b>: At 1st level, a sacred fist gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. He uses his warpriest level as his monk level for determining the amount of damage dealt with an unarmed strike. This ability replaces focus weapon.</p><p><b>Blessed Fortitude (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, a sacred fist can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with help from his deity. If he succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, he instead avoids the effect entirely. A helpless sacred fist does not gain the benefit of the blessed fortitude ability. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 3rd level.</p><p><b>Bonus Style Feat</b>: At 6th level, the sacred fist gains a style feat as a bonus feat. The sacred fist must meet the style feat's prerequisites. He uses his warpriest level as his effective monk level for the purpose of meeting the feat's prerequisites. At 12th and 18th levels, a sacred fist gains either another style feat or a feat that requires a style feat as a prerequisite. This ability replaces the bonus feats gained at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.</p><p><b>Ki Pool (Su)</b>: At 7th level, the sacred fist gains a ki pool. This ability functions as the monk class feature, using the sacred fist's level - 3 as his effective monk level when determining the number of points in his pool and the bonuses granted to his unarmed strike. Additionally, the sacred fist can as a swift action spend 1 point from his ki pool to grant himself a +1 insight bonus to his AC for 1 minute. (This is in addition to the normal ki ability to gain a dodge bonus to AC.) This insight bonus increases by 1 for every 3 levels above 7th (to a maximum of +5 at 19th level). This ability replaces sacred armor.</p><p><b>Miraculous Fortitude (Su)</b>: At 9th level, the sacred fist's blessed fortitude ability improves. He still takes no damage or negative effect when he succeeds at a Fortitude save, but now when he fails a Fortitude saving throw against a spell or effect that deals damage (including ability damage and drain), he takes only half the amount of damage. A helpless sacred fist does not gain the benefit of miraculous fortitude. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 9th level.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"ff2WmayBUAbLFYWe"}

<text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>CLASS FEATURES</h1><p>The following are the class features of the shaman.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies</b>: A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons as well as with light armor and medium armor.</p><p><b>Spells</b>: A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list (see page 48). A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p><p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell's level. The saving throw DC against a shaman's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the shaman's Wisdom modifier.</p><p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-9. In addition, she receives a number of bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 on page 17 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>).</p><p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she spends 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p><p><b>Orisons</b>: Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on Table 1-9. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p><p><b>Spirit (Su)</b>: A shaman has a mystical connection with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit (see Spirits on page 37), which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p><p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p><p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities given for the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities given for the true version of her selected spirit.</p><p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), her spirit and her mystery must match. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her previously selected mystery or spirit to make both conform.</p><p><b>Spirit Animal (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. See the Spirit Animal section on page 47.</p><p>A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells as a witch's familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman's spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p><p><b>Spirit Magic</b>: A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats on page 113 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>).</p><p><b>Hex</b>: A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken her foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th levels, the shaman learns a new hex. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. Unless otherwise noted, a shaman cannot select a hex more than once.</p><p>Using a hex is a standard action that doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman's level + the shaman's Wisdom modifier.</p><p><i>Chant (Su)</i>: A shaman can chant as a move action. Any creature within 30 feet that is under the effect of the shaman's charm, evil eye, fortune, fury, or misfortune hex has that effect's duration extended by 1 round. A shaman cannot select both this hex and the witch's cackle hex.</p><p><i>Charm (Su)</i>: A shaman charms an animal or a humanoid creature within 30 feet by beckoning to it and speaking soothing words. Doing this improves the attitude of an animal or humanoid creature by 1 step, as if the shaman had successfully used the Diplomacy skill. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the shaman's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. Whether or not the save is successful, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours. At 8th level, this effect improves the attitude of the creature by two steps. This is a mind-affecting charm effect.</p><p><i>Evil Eye (Su)</i>: The shaman causes doubt to creep into the mind of a foe within 30 feet that she can see. The target takes a -2 penalty on one of the following (shaman's choice): ability checks, AC, attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks. This hex lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the shaman's Wisdom modifier. A successful Will saving throw reduces this duration to just 1 round. At 8th level, the penalty changes to -4. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p><p><i>Fetish (Ex)</i>: The shaman receives Craft Wondrous Item as a bonus feat and gains a +4 insight bonus on Spellcraft checks to identify magic items.</p><p><i>Fortune (Su)</i>: The shaman grants a creature within 30 feet a bit of good luck for 1 round. The target can call upon this good luck once per round, allowing it to reroll any ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, taking the better result. The target creature must decide to use this benefit before the first roll is made. At 8th and 16th levels, the duration of this hex increases by 1 round. Once a creature has benefited from the fortune hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours.</p><p><i>Fury (Su)</i>: A shaman incites a creature within 30 feet into a primal fury. The target receives a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against fear for a number of rounds equal to the shaman's Wisdom modifier. At 8th and 16th levels, these bonuses increase by 1. Once a creature has benefited from the fury hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours.</p><p><i>Healing (Su)</i>: A shaman soothes the wounds of those she touches. This hex acts as <i>cure light wounds</i>, using the shaman's caster level. Once a creature has benefited from the healing hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours. At 5th level, this hex acts as <i>cure moderate wounds</i>.</p><p><i>Misfortune (Su)</i>: The shaman causes a creature within 30 feet to suffer grave misfortune for 1 round. Anytime the creature attempts an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, it must roll twice and take the worse result. A successful Will saving throw negates this hex. At 8th level and again at 16th level, the duration of this hex increases by 1 round. This hex affects all rolls the target must make while it lasts. Whether or not the save is successful, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p><p><i>Secret (Ex)</i>: The shaman receives one metamagic feat as a bonus feat. The shaman must meet the prerequisites for the feat.</p><p><i>Shapeshift (Su)</i>: The shaman transforms herself into another form, as per <i>alter self</i>, for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. Changing form (including changing back) is a standard action that doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. At 8th level, this hex works as <i>beast shape I</i>. At 12th level, this hex works as <i>beast shape II</i>. At 16th level, this hex works as <i>beast shape III</i>. At 20th level, this hex works as <i>beast shape IV</i>.</p><p><i>Tongues (Su)</i>: The shaman understands any spoken language, as per <i>comprehend languages</i>, for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. At 5th level, a shaman can use this hex to speak any language, as <i>tongues</i>.</p><p><i>Ward (Su)</i>: The shaman places a protective ward over one creature. The warded creature receives a +2 Deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws. This effect lasts until the warded creature is hit or fails a saving throw. A shaman knows when a warded creature is no longer protected. A shaman can have only one ward active at a time. If the shaman uses this hex while a previous ward is still active, that previous ward immediately ends. A shaman cannot use this hex on herself. At 8th and 16th levels, the bonuses provided by this ward increase by 1.</p><p><i>Witch Hex</i>: The shaman selects any one hex normally available through the witch's hex class feature. She treats her shaman level as her witch level when determining the powers and abilities of the hex. She uses her Wisdom modifier in place of her Intelligence modifier for the hex. The shaman cannot select a major hex, a grand hex, or a witch hex that has the same name as a shaman hex.</p><p><b>Wandering Spirit (Su)</b>: At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one she selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes gained from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities given for the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability given for the true version of her wandering spirit.</p><p><b>Wandering Hex</b>: At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purpose of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects a hex from her wandering spirit and then bonds with another spirit, she loses the hex immediately, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p><p><b>Manifestation (Su)</b>: Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman's spirit, and is described in the spirit's entry.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1classes\">^Classes</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">Archetypes and Class Options</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"fwYypIK2NcSGPyst"}
{"name":"Designing a Class","permission":{"default":0,"JgpLZkPryhl1EFab":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_mqyqwzciz6","path":"Pathfinder RPG - Advanced Class Guide Reference Library#/CF_SEP/ADVANCED CLASS GUIDE#/CF_SEP/CHAPTER 6: DESIGNING CLASSES","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\"></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>There are few rules systems as important to the game as those that govern the classes. In the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, classes represent the legendary heroes of the game, as well as some of its most dastardly villains. Whereas a feat, a spell, or a magic item has a limited impact on the world as a whole, a class affects the entire game. Classes populate the world, becoming a part of the tapestry that informs the tone and narrative of the game. Because they're so important, designing new classes is one of the most delicate and difficult tasks for a Game Master. This guide is here to walk you through the process of designing a new class by providing rules and advice to help your creation fit seamlessly into the game.</p><p>Much like monster design, the process of creating a class has a number of elements to consider. It requires that you compare your concepts with those of other classes and weigh different abilities against each other. A class feature that is overpowered for one class might be a perfect fit for another, depending on other abilities. Due to the number of variables, there's no concrete system for designing a class (as there is for races in the <i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide</i>). Instead, this chapter gives you an idea of the process Paizo's designers go through when designing a class, so you'll know what to consider in your own designs.</p><h1>CLASS, ARCHETYPE, OR PRESTIGE CLASS?</h1><p>Classes can take many forms in the game. While most characters pick a class and stick with it for their entire adventuring career, others dabble in archetypes or take a few levels in a prestige class. When designing a class for the game, it's essential to first ask whether it's a new class, a class archetype, or a prestige class.</p><p><b>Class</b>: Classes are vital to the game. Progressing from level 1 to 20, each class is designed to give a player a complete experience. Each one has a strong concept and rules niche separating it from the others in the game. In essence, this \"flavor,\" in terms of its ideas and mechanics, allows it to interact with the game in a way that no other class does.</p><p><b>Archetype</b>: An archetype is a close relative of, and is built off, one of the existing classes, modifying a few of its parent class's rules and shifting its concept a bit to make for a new way to play. A new archetype is simpler to design than a new class, since much of the work is already done for you. It uses most of the rules and background of its parent class (so you don't have to repeat the same information), while changing a few details and mechanics to make it function a bit differently in play. To design an archetype, you need to be familiar with the process of designing a class, but there are additional guidelines as well. See Archetype Design on page 247 for more information.</p><p><b>Prestige Class</b>: Like a class, a prestige class has its own underlying rules and concept, but a character cannot begin play by taking levels in it. Instead, a character must qualify to take levels of the class (usually having to wait until at least 6th level to do so). In addition, prestige classes usually progress only for 5 or 10 levels, meaning that the character will have to take levels in another class later in her career in a campaign that continues to 20th level. Prestige classes are very tightly focused on one particular concept or set of rules, making them perfect for the character who wants to specialize in one area, even if that means sacrificing versatility in another. To design a prestige class, you need to be familiar with the process of designing a class, but there are additional guidelines as well. See page 249 for more information.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter6designingclasses\">^Designing Classes</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_appendix\">Appendix</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"gl4Hlz359UGA4X2M"}
{"name":"Hunter Archetype","permission":{"default":0,"JgpLZkPryhl1EFab":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_zrrxjaps56","path":"Pathfinder RPG - Advanced Class Guide Reference Library#/CF_SEP/ADVANCED CLASS GUIDE#/CF_SEP/CHAPTER 2: ARCHETYPES AND CLASS OPTIONS","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\"></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>A hunter typically partners with an animal companion and takes on aspects of beasts to pursue her quarry. But some become animals themselves, lead larger groups of animals in the hunt, or call upon the companionship and power of vermin.</p><h1>DIVINE HUNTER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>While most hunters heed the call of nature and fight to protect its bounty, some are inspired to serve a higher power. These divine hunters use faith to aid them in their struggles, and their faith infuses their animal companions, making these companions champions of their deities.</p><p><b>Alignment</b>: A divine hunter's alignment must be within one step of her deity's, along either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis. A divine hunter can otherwise be of any alignment. This ability replaces alignment.</p><p><b>Class Skills</b>: A divine hunter gains Knowledge (religion) as a class skill, but she does not gain Knowledge (dungeoneering) as a class skill.</p><p><b>Domain</b>: At 3rd level, a divine hunter learns to call upon the power of her deity. The divine hunter must select one domain from those available to her deity. She gains the granted powers of this domain, using her hunter level - 2 as her cleric level for determining when the powers are gained and what effects they have. Once she chooses this domain, it cannot be changed.</p><p>If the divine hunter selects the animal domain, she does not gain a second animal companion upon reaching an effective cleric level of 4th. When the divine hunter would gain that ability, her animal companion instead gains two ability score increases (gaining +1 to two different ability scores or +2 to one ability score). If her animal companion dies or is released, when she gains a new one, it benefits from this ability score increase.</p><p>In addition, the divine hunter adds the 1st-level domain spell from her domain to her list of spells known. She adds the 2nd-level domain spell at 6th level, the 3rd-level domain spell at 9th level, the 4th-level domain spell at 12th level, the 5th-level domain spell at 15th level, and the 6th-level domain spell at 18th level.</p><p>This ability replaces teamwork feat.</p><p><b>Otherworldly Companion (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, a hunter's companion takes on otherworldly features. If the divine hunter is good (or worships a good deity), the animal companion gains the celestial template. If the hunter is evil (or worships an evil deity), the animal companion gains the fiendish template. If the hunter is neutral and worships a neutral deity, she must choose either the celestial or fiendish template; once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. The companion's CR is considered to be equal to its hit dice for the purpose of the celestial or fiendish template. This ability replaces hunter tactics.</p><h1>FERAL HUNTER (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>A feral hunter has forged a bond with nature that's so strong that she doesn't merely channel the aspects of animals- she actually becomes an animal herself. Though she lacks an animal companion, a feral hunter is in tune with the beast lurking within her flesh and spirit, and lives in a near-wild state of being. A feral hunter often resembles a lycanthrope, but her power comes from her own nature and is not influenced by moonlight or silver.</p><p><b>Solitary</b>: Unlike most hunters, a feral hunter does not gain an animal companion.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Feral Focus (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a feral hunter gains a limited ability to change her shape into hybrid animal forms. This ability functions as the animal focus class feature, except that the hunter always applies the animal aspect to herself, and there is no limit to this ability's duration. She can end this effect as a free action.</p><h1>FERAL HUNTER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>When a feral hunter uses this ability, her body takes on cosmetic aspects of an animal, such as furry skin, longer nails and teeth, and oddly colored eyes; these changes grant her no abilities other than what is stated in the animal focus class feature description, and they end when she takes on a different aspect or ends the effect. This physical change is a polymorph effect, though the effects of the animal focus are not.</p><p>This ability alters animal focus and replaces hunter tactics and speak with master.</p><p><b>Precise Summoned Animal (Ex)</b>: This ability functions as the precise companion class feature, except the hunter grants all her teamwork feats to all animals she summons with <i>summon nature's ally</i>. This ability alters precise companion.</p><p><b>Wild Shape (Su)</b>: At 4th level, a feral hunter gains the ability to change shape. This ability functions like the druid wild shape ability, except the hunter can take only animal forms (not elemental or plant forms). The hunter's effective druid level is equal to her class level. This ability replaces bonus tricks, improved empathic link, greater empathic link, one with the wild, and raise animal companion.</p><p><b>Summon Pack (Sp)</b>: Starting at 6th level, whenever a feral hunter casts a <i>summon nature's ally</i>spell to summon one or more animals, she summons one additional animal of the same type. The summoned creature or creatures must be animals and must be of the same type as the hunter's current animal aspect or of a similar type (bears for bear aspect, dogs or wolves for wolf aspect, great cats for tiger aspect, and so on). The additional creature immediately vanishes if the hunter chooses a different aspect or ends his feral focus ability. She can increase the duration of any one <i>summon nature's ally</i>spell affected by this ability to 1 minute per level. She can have only one spell with a duration increased by this ability active at a time. This ability replaces the teamwork feats gained at 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th levels.</p><h1>PACKMASTER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Some hunters form bonds with packs of well-trained creatures. Whether such a hunter is a northern berserker running with a pack of timber wolves or a savage warrior dashing through the jungle alongside her herd of dimetrodons, the packmaster revels in the thrill of the hunt and the glory of the kill. A packmaster is more comfortable in groups than alone, and although her animal companions may be weaker than a typical hunter's, what they lack in strength they make up for in numbers.</p><p><b>Pack Bond (Ex)</b>: A packmaster can have more than one animal companion, but she must divide her effective druid level between her companions to determine the abilities of each one. For example, a 4th-level packmaster can have one 4th-level animal companion, or two 2nd-level companions, or one 3rd-level companion and one 1st-level companion, or four 1st-level companions.</p><p>When a packmaster gains a level, she must decide how to allocate the increase among her animal companions, including whether or not to add a new 1st-level companion. Once a hunter level is allocated to a particular companion, it cannot be redistributed while that companion is in the packmaster's service. She must release that companion or wait until the companion dies to allocate its levels to another companion, which she can then do the next time she refreshes her spell slots for the day. The share spells animal companion ability applies to only one animal companion at a time-the packmaster cannot use it to cast a spell that affects only a single target and have the spell affect all of her animal companions.</p><p>A packmaster's precise companion, woodland stride, and teamwork feats apply to only one of her animal companions at a time. (For example, a packmaster can apply precise companion to one companion, woodland stride to another, and a given teamwork feat to a third, but cannot apply one of those benefits to two animal companions at once.) As a swift action, she can change which companions gain any or all of these benefits. This ability replaces animal companion.</p><p><b>Pack Focus (Su)</b>: This ability functions like animal focus, with the following exceptions. A packmaster can apply her animal aspect to only one of her animal companions at a time without having it count against the number of minutes per day she can use that ability. When using animal focus on herself or any other animal companion, the ability counts against her minutes per day as normal. She can have only two animal aspects in effect at a time-one that counts against her minutes per day and one that doesn't-and they can't both be applied to the same companion. Unless all of her companions are dead, the hunter can't apply the companion's aspect to herself (and thereby gain the benefit of its unlimited duration). This ability replaces animal focus.</p><p><b>Teamwork Feat (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level or any level at which a packmaster would gain a bonus teamwork feat, she can instead increase the number of her animal companions that gain the benefits of her precise companion, woodland stride, and teamwork feats by 1. She can select this ability multiple times. This ability alters teamwork feat.</p><p><b>Second Pack Focus (Su)</b>: At 8th level, the hunter gains an ability that functions as per second animal focus, except the hunter can either apply one aspect to each companion or apply both aspects to the same companion. The foci on the companions don't need to be the same, nor do they need to be the same as the one applied to the packmaster. This ability replaces second animal focus.</p><p><b>Master of the Pack (Ex)</b>: At 20th level, a packmaster and her animal companions can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. Also, each day when a packmaster gains new spells for the day, she can apply one animal focus to herself or one of her animal companions for the entire day (if all of her animal companions are dead, she instead can apply two animal foci to herself for the entire day). These foci are in addition to any granted by her pack focus class ability. This ability replaces master hunter.</p><h1>PRIMAL COMPANION HUNTER (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Most hunters are skilled at awakening the primal beasts inside themselves. However, some can instead activate the primal essence within their animal companions. These primal companion hunters bestow upon their companions the ability to suddenly manifest new and terrifying powers-whether throwbacks to long-extinct beasts, bizarre mutations from extreme environments, or new abilities crafted through generations of selective breeding.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Primal Transformation (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a primal companion hunter can awaken a primal creature from within his animal companion as a swift action. The animal companion gains a pool of 2 evolution points (<i>Advanced Player's Guide</i>60) that can be used to temporarily give the companion evolutions as if it were an eidolon.</p><p>A primal companion hunter uses her hunter level to determine her effective summoner level for the purpose of qualifying for evolutions and determining their effects. At 8th level, the number of evolution points in her pool increases to 4, and at 15th level, it increases to 6.</p><p>Activating these evolutions on the animal companion is a swift action. A primal companion hunter can use this ability for 1 minute per day per hunter level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. An animal companion that is transformed in this way cannot exceed the maximum number of attacks available to the eidolon of a summoner whose class level equals that of the hunter. While transformed in this way, the animal companion's type changes to magical beast, though the primal companion hunter still treats it as an animal for the purpose of the Handle Animal skill.</p><p>If a primal companion hunter's animal companion is dead, she can apply these evolutions to herself instead of to her animal companion. Uses of this ability count toward the hunter's maximum daily duration of evolution use. This ability replaces animal focus.</p><p><b>Primal Surge (Su)</b>: At 8th level, once per day as a swift action, a primal companion hunter can touch her animal companion and grant it one evolution that costs up to 4 points. The companion must meet the prerequisites of the selected evolution. Unlike the evolutions from primal transformation, this evolution is not set; it can be changed each time the hunter uses this ability. Using primal surge activates the primal transformation ability on the companion if it isn't already active. This effect lasts until the hunter ends the primal transformation. This ability does not allow a companion to exceed its maximum number of natural attacks.</p><p>This ability can grant only one evolution at a time, even if the chosen evolution could be selected multiple times.</p><p>This ability can grant an evolution that allows additional evolution points to be spent to upgrade that evolution (such as damage reduction or flight), and any points left over can be spent on such upgrades. This ability cannot be used to grant an upgrade to an evolution that the companion already possesses. This ability replaces second animal focus.</p><p><b>Primal Master (Su)</b>: At 20th level, a primal companion hunter becomes in tune with his primal nature. He can activate his companion's primal aspect as a free action. When using primal surge, he can grant his companion two evolutions instead of one (each costing up to 4 evolution points). This ability replaces master hunter.</p><h1>VERMINOUS HUNTER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>A verminous hunter calls on the ceaseless, single-minded dedication of vermin to hunt and overwhelm her prey. Where other hunters invoke the cunning, animalistic powers of the alpha predators, she calls on the powers of the lowest life forms, reaching out to the spider instead of the monkey, the mantis instead of the snake, or the moth instead of the owl.</p><p><b>Vermin Companion (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a verminous hunter must choose a vermin companion (<i>Ultimate Magic</i>36) instead of an animal companion. The hunter tactics class ability allows a verminous hunter to grant her teamwork feats to a mindless vermin companion. This ability alters animal companion.</p><p><b>Vermin Empathy (Ex)</b>: A verminous hunter gains the wild empathy ability, but can use it only to influence vermin (not animals or magical beasts). This ability alters wild empathy.</p><p><b>Vermin Focus (Su)</b>: A verminous hunter can take on the aspect of a vermin. This ability functions as animal focus, but allows only the following choices.</p><p><i>Ant</i>: The creature gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.</p><p><i>Beetle</i>: The creature gains a +2 enhancement bonus to its natural armor bonus. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level. (A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.)</p><p><i>Centipede</i>: The creature gains a +2 competence bonus on Climb checks and a +2 bonus to CMD against pull, push, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers. These bonuses increase to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.</p><p><i>Cockroach</i>: The creature gains a +4 bonus on saves against cold dangers, disease, heat dangers, starvation, and thirst, and on Constitution checks to avoid suffocation. These bonuses increase to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p><p><i>Crab</i>: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Swim checks and a +2 competence bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks. These bonuses increase to +6 and +4 respectively at 8th level, and +8 and +6 at 15th level.</p><p><i>Flea</i>: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on saves against disease and on Acrobatics checks to jump. These bonuses increase to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p><p><i>Fly</i>: The creature gains a +2 bonus on Perception checks and on Acrobatics checks to balance or fall safely. These bonuses increase to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.</p><p><i>Leech</i>: The creature gains a +2 competence bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks, and deals 1 point of bleed damage every time it succeeds at a grapple combat maneuver check to damage an opponent. These benefits increase to a +4 bonus and 3 points of bleed damage at 8th level, and a +6 bonus and 5 points of bleed damage at 15th level. Bleed damage from this ability does not stack with itself.</p><p><i>Mantis</i>: The creature gains a +2 bonus on attacks of opportunity and a +2 competence bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks. These bonuses increase to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.</p><p><i>Moth</i>: The creature gains darkvision to a range of 60 feet. At 8th level, the range increases by 30 feet. At 15th level, the creature gains blindsense to a range of 10 feet.</p><p><i>Phasmid</i>: The creature gains low-light vision and a +4 competence bonus on Stealth checks in forests or plains. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p><p><i>Scorpion</i>: The creature gains a +2 competence bonus on Stealth checks and on grapple combat maneuver checks. These bonuses increase to +6 and +4 respectively at 8th level, and to +8 and +6 at 15th level.</p><p><i>Spider</i>: The creature gains a +2 competence bonus on Stealth checks, saving throws against web effects (magical or otherwise), and checks to break free of webs. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.</p><p><i>Wasp</i>: The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on Perception checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p><p><i>Worm</i>: The creature gains a 25% chance to treat any critical hit or sneak attack as a normal hit (as the <i>fortification</i>armor special ability). This chance increases to 50% at 8th level, and 75% at 15th level.</p><p>This ability replaces animal focus.</p><p><b>Swarm Stride (Ex)</b>: At 5th level, a verminous hunter learns to move through vermin without danger. He can safely pass through swarms of vermin and does not take swarm damage while within a vermin swarm's space. In addition, he is immune to a swarm's distraction ability. If the hunter or his animal companion attacks a swarm, they lose this protection against that swarm only. This ability replaces woodland stride.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"gwmbi8y5Gax8p82W"}

{"name":"Prestige Class Design","permission":{"default":0,"JgpLZkPryhl1EFab":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_mqyqwzciz6","path":"Pathfinder RPG - Advanced Class Guide Reference Library#/CF_SEP/ADVANCED CLASS GUIDE#/CF_SEP/CHAPTER 6: DESIGNING CLASSES","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\"></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Although similar to a class in many ways, a prestige class is specifically designed to be used by higher-level characters through multiclassing. While the general design principles might be similar, the design of a prestige class has a number of additional factors to consider.</p><h1>Concept and Rules</h1><p>A prestige class needs a very strong concept. Not only does it need to make sense in the world, there also needs to be a logical reason why a character cannot begin play by taking levels in the class. Frequently, the rationale can be explained in the prestige class's story. For example, you might design a prestige class for an order of knights, but determine that they accept and train only members who have proven themselves in battle. New, young recruits might be a part of the order but don't receive the special training represented by the prestige class until they have been tried and tested. Other prestige classes might require a certain ability or skill before they can be accessed by characters. A group of wizards who are experts at flying can't train members who are unable to cast <i>fly</i>.</p><p>A prestige class should be tightly focused on one rules concept, with most of its features tied to that concept. In our flying wizard example above, the prestige class features might grant bonuses while flying, the ability to cast <i>fly</i>more often, and the ability to avoid falling damage.</p><h1>Requirements and Levels</h1><p>Unlike a base class or an archetype, a prestige class has a few elements that are worth careful examination. First, all prestige classes have a list of requirements that characters must meet before taking a level in the class. These requirements should make it impossible for a character to take levels in the prestige class before 6th level. For example, requiring a base attack bonus of +5, the ability to cast 3rd-level spells, or 5 ranks in a certain skill means that a character must hit 5th level before qualifying (meaning that his first level in the prestige class will be his 6th character level).</p><p>You should also carefully consider how many levels there will be in your prestige class. Most have either 5 or 10 levels that a PC can gain. Although you can work with any number, it is recommended that you use at least 5 levels, as doing so allows you to include some truly impressive abilities at the higher levels of the prestige class.</p><h1>Basic Mechanics</h1><p>Designing a prestige class is similar to designing a base class, with some important exceptions. First, prestige classes rarely grant many class skills. Most characters who gain access to the class (if they conform to it in terms of theme and concept) will already possess most of the relevant skills, making access redundant. Second, prestige classes use different saving throw progressions for good and bad saves. This prevents the inflation of base saving throw bonuses through multiclassing.</p><h1>Feature Design</h1><p>While the process of designing primary and secondary features of a prestige class is the same as it is for any other class or archetype, keep the actual level of the character in mind when deciding at what level he would gain a given feature. A class feature that might be fine for a 1st-level character would be underpowered as the feature for the 1st level of a prestige class, since that ability would actually be gained at 6th character level. Remember that while a character might not qualify for a prestige class at the earliest possible level (i.e. 6th), you should still design the features as if they had to prevent overpowered features from being used by low-level characters.</p><h1>Integration</h1><p>Unlike a class, which is designed to provide a complete play experience, a prestige class is designed so that it can be completed before a character reaches the end of her adventuring career. As a result, the character might end up finishing a prestige class at 11th or 16th level and then be forced to turn to another class for the remainder of her levels. A good prestige class should take this into account by giving the character a valuable feature toward the end of the class that can make up for the character being stuck taking levels in another class that grants her only features designed for significantly lower-level characters. This feature should feel similar to a class capstone ability, although designed for the lowest level at which a character can qualify for it.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter6designingclasses\">^Designing Classes</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_appendix\">Appendix</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"iQKoWclSbGpYeBg0"}

Blood rage powers grant powers in a theme, similar to how a bloodrager's bloodline powers work. A barbarian cannot select from more than one group of blood rage powers. A barbarian of any level can take a lesser blood rage power. The middle blood rage power (the one without \"lesser\" or \"greater\" in the title) can be taken only by a barbarian of 6th level or higher who already has the lesser blood rage power of its group. A greater blood rage power can be taken only by a barbarian of 10th level or higher who already has the middle blood rage power.</p><p><i>Abyssal Blood (Su)</i>: Once per day when the barbarian enters a rage, she can choose to grow one size category larger than her base size (as <i>enlarge person</i>, even if the barbarian isn't humanoid).</p><p><i>Abyssal Blood, Greater (Su)</i>: While raging, the barbarian gains resistance 5 to acid, cold, and fire.</p><p><i>Abyssal Blood, Lesser (Su)</i>: While raging, the barbarian gains two claw attacks. These attacks are considered primary attacks and are made at the barbarian's full base attack bonus. They deal 1d6 points of slashing damage for Medium creatures (1d4 if Small) plus her Strength modifier.</p><p><i>Celestial Blood (Su)</i>: While raging, the barbarian gains resistance 5 to acid and cold.</p><p><i>Celestial Blood, Greater (Su)</i>: Once per rage, the barbarian can reroll one ability check, skill check, or saving throw she just made. She must take the second result, even if it's lower. She must decide to use this ability after the die is rolled but before the result is revealed.</p><p><i>Celestial Blood, Lesser (Su)</i>: While the barbarian is raging, her melee attacks are considered good-aligned weapons for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. Furthermore, the barbarian deals an additional 1d6 points of damage when she damages an evil outsider with a melee attack.</p><p><i>Draconic Blood (Su)</i>: Choose an energy type from the following: acid, cold, fire, or electricity. While raging, the barbarian gains resistance 5 against the chosen energy type and a +1 natural armor bonus.</p><p><i>Draconic Blood, Greater (Su)</i>: While raging, the barbarian gains a breath weapon that she can use once per day. For every 2 barbarian levels, this breath weapon deals 1d6 points of damage of the energy type she chose for the draconic blood power, either in a 30-foot cone (if cold or fire) or a 60-foot line (if acid or electricity). Those caught in the area of the breath can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level + her Constitution modifier.</p><p><i>Draconic Blood, Lesser (Su)</i>: While raging, the barbarian gains two claw attacks. These attacks are considered primary attacks and are made at the barbarian's full base attack bonus. They deal 1d6 points of slashing damage for Medium creatures (1d4 if Small) plus her Strength modifier.</p><p><i>Elemental Blood (Su)</i>: While raging, the barbarian gains energy resistance 10 against the energy type chosen when she took lesser elemental blood.</p><p><i>Elemental Blood, Greater (Su)</i>: While raging, the barbarian gains a special movement type or bonus based on her chosen element: acid grants a burrow speed of 30 feet, cold grants a swim speed of 60 feet, fire grants an increase of 30 feet to her base land speed, and electricity grants a fly speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability).</p><p><i>Elemental Blood, Lesser (Su)</i>: Choose an energy type: acid, cold, fire, or electricity. While raging, as a swift action up to three times a day, the barbarian can imbue her melee attacks with elemental energy, dealing an additional 1d6 points of damage of the chosen energy type for 1 round.</p><p><i>Fey Blood (Su)</i>: While raging, when the barbarian charges, she ignores difficult terrain (including magical terrain, but not other creatures).</p><p><i>Fey Blood, Greater (Su)</i>: While raging, as long as the barbarian moves at least 10 feet, she gain the effects of <i>blur</i>for 1 round.</p><p><i>Fey Blood, Lesser (Su)</i>: While raging, each time the barbarian confirms a critical hit, the target must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level + her Constitution modifier) or be confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.</p><p><i>Infernal Blood (Su)</i>: While raging, the barbarian gains fire resistance 5, as well as a +2 bonus on saving throws against poison.</p><p><i>Infernal Blood, Greater (Su)</i>: While raging, the barbarian gains a +4 bonus against enchantment and fear effects.</p><p><i>Infernal Blood, Lesser (Su)</i>: While raging, up to three times a day as a swift action, the barbarian can infuse her attacks with hellfire for 1 round. During this time, all of her melee attacks gain the <i>flaming</i>weapon special ability.</p><p><i>Undead Blood (Su)</i>: While the barbarian is raging, her melee attacks are treated as if they were made with a weapon with the <i>ghost touch</i>weapon special ability.</p><p><i>Undead Blood, Greater (Su)</i>: While raging, the barbarian gains cold resistance 10, as well as DR 10/- against nonlethal damage.</p><p><i>Undead Blood, Lesser (Su)</i>: While raging, when the barbarian hits a creature with a charge attack, the creature she hit becomes shaken for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 her barbarian level (minimum 1). This effect does not stack with other fear effects to cause a stronger condition.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"ibyWe8vQceaBBkIW"}
{"name":"Swashbuckler Archetype","permission":{"default":0,"JgpLZkPryhl1EFab":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_zrrxjaps56","path":"Pathfinder RPG - Advanced Class Guide Reference Library#/CF_SEP/ADVANCED CLASS GUIDE#/CF_SEP/CHAPTER 2: ARCHETYPES AND CLASS OPTIONS","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\"></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Though the imagination usually conjures images of a well-dressed dandy with a trusty rapier, there are many varieties of swashbuckler. The following are just a few examples. For other class options available to the swashbuckler, see Dares on page 94.</p><h1>DARING INFILTRATOR (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Not known for their flashy entrances or for standing out in a crowd, a daring infiltrator uses stealth, disguise, and ruthless guile to pursue her goals. Some of these swashbucklers work to undermine evil organizations, while others are master thieves or mysterious assassins.</p><p><b>Class Skills</b>: A daring infiltrator gains Disguise and Stealth as class skills, but does not gain Diplomacy, Perform, and Profession as class skills. This alters the swashbuckler's class skills.</p><p><b>Bonus Feats</b>: In addition to combat feats, a daring infiltrator's bonus feats at 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th levels can come from the following list: Alertness, Antagonize(UM), Cosmopolitan(APG), Deceitful, Deft Hands, Disarming Threat Deed (see page 144), Persuasive, Prodigy(UM), and Skill Focus. This alters the bonus feats class feature.</p><p><b>Quick-Tongued (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, a daring infiltrator gains a +1 bonus on Bluff checks. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces charmed life.</p><p><b>Deeds</b>: A daring infiltrator gains the following deeds.</p><p><i>Clandestine Expertise (Ex)</i>: At 3rd level, a daring infiltrator with at least 1 panache point gains a +2 bonus on Disguise and Stealth checks. Also, as long as she has at least 1 panache point, when she successfully aids another with a Disguise or Stealth check, she grants the subject a +4 bonus on the skill check instead of the normal +2. This deed replaces swashbuckler initiative.</p><p><i>Silence Is Golden (Ex)</i>: At 3rd level, when a daring infiltrator with at least 1 panache point succeeds at a trip or grapple combat maneuver check, the target is rendered mute for 1 round. For every increment of 5 by which the result of the combat maneuver check exceeds the opponent's CMD, the target remains mute for an additional round. A mute creature cannot speak, use language-dependent effects or verbal components, or use command words. This deed replaces menacing swordplay.</p><p><i>Authoritative Bluff (Ex)</i>: At 11th level, a daring infiltrator can spend 1 panache point to reroll a Bluff check after the roll is made but before the result is revealed. She must take the result of the second roll, even if it is lower. Additionally, a daring infiltrator with at least 1 panache point gains a +5 bonus on Bluff checks to pretend to be someone's superior (socially or in the military). If she succeeds at the check, the target obeys any reasonable orders she gives as it would those of an actual superior in the situation. This deed replaces bleeding wound.</p><h1>FLYING BLADE (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>While most swashbucklers prefer their battles up close, others prefer dealing death from a distance.</p><p><b>Panache</b>: Unlike other swashbucklers, a flying blade regains panache only when she confirms a critical hit or makes a killing blow with a dagger or a starknife. This ability alters panache.</p><p><b>Deeds</b>: A flying blade gains the following deeds.</p><p><i>Subtle Throw (Ex)</i>: At 1st level, a flying blade can spend 1 panache point as part of a ranged attack with a dagger or a starknife to make the attack without provoking attacks of opportunity. At 6th level, as a swift action she can spend 1 panache point to make all of her ranged attacks with daggers or starknives without provoking attacks of opportunity until the start of her next turn. This deed replaces dodging panache.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><i>Disrupting Counter (Ex)</i>: At 3rd level, when an opponent makes a melee attack against her, she can spend 1 panache point to make an attack of opportunity against the attacking foe. This attack of opportunity can be made with either a dagger or a starknife. If the attack hits, the opponent takes a -4 penalty on all attack rolls until the end of its turn. This deed replaces kip-up.</p><p><i>Precise Throw (Ex)</i>: At 3rd level, as long as she has at least 1 panache point, a flying blade can use her precise strike with a thrown dagger or starknife as long as the target is within 60 feet of her, and she increases the range increment of these weapons by 5 feet. She can spend 1 panache point when she throws a dagger or a starknife to ignore all range increment penalties on that ranged attack. This deed replaces menacing swordplay.</p><p><i>Targeted Throw (Ex)</i>: At 7th level, a flying blade can target individual body parts. This deed functions as the swashbuckler's targeted strike deed, but the flying blade can also use this deed when making ranged attacks with either a dagger or a starknife as long as the target is within 60 feet of the flying blade. This deed replaces targeted strike. <i>Bleeding Wound (Ex)</i>: At 11th level, a flying blade can deal bleed damage as part of an attack. This deed functions as the swashbuckler's bleeding wound deed, but the flying blade can also use this deed when making ranged attacks with either a dagger or a starknife as long as the target is within 60 feet of the flying blade. This deed alters bleeding wound.</p><p><i>Perfect Throw (Ex)</i>: At 15th level, a flying blade can pool all of her attack potential into a single attack. This deed functions as the swashbuckler's perfect strike deed, but the flying blade must use this deed when making ranged attacks with either a dagger or a starknife, and she can use this deed only on targets within 60 feet of her. This deed replaces perfect thrust.</p><p><b>Flying Blade Training (Ex)</b>: At 5th level, a flying blade gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls when using daggers or starknives in combat. When she wields a dagger or a starknife, she gains the benefit of the Improved Critical feat with those weapons. Additionally, a flying blade increases the range increment of a thrown dagger or starknife by 5 feet. This range increment increase stacks with that of precise throw.</p><p>At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls increases by 1, and the range increment increases by 5 feet. This ability replaces swashbuckler weapon training.</p><p><b>Flying Blade Mastery (Ex)</b>: At 20th level, when an attack that a flying blade makes with a dagger or a starknife threatens a critical hit, that critical hit is automatically confirmed. Furthermore, the critical modifiers of daggers and starknives that she wields increase by 1 (2 becomes 3, and so on). This ability replaces swashbuckler weapon mastery.</p><h1>INSPIRED BLADE (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>An inspired blade is both a force of personality and a sage of swordplay dedicated to the perfection of combat with the rapier. Inspired blades use the science and geometry of swordplay to beautiful and deadly effect.</p><p><b>Inspired Panache (Ex)</b>: Each day, an inspired blade gains a number of panache points equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1) plus her Intelligence modifier (minimum 1), instead of just her Charisma modifier.</p><p>Unlike other swashbucklers, an inspired blade regains no panache from scoring a killing blow. She regains panache only from scoring a critical hit with a rapier.</p><p>This ability alters the panache class feature.</p><p><b>Inspired Finesse (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, an inspired blade gains the benefits of Weapon Finesse with the rapier (this ability counts as having the Weapon Finesse feat for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites) and gains Weapon Focus (rapier) as a bonus feat. This ability replaces swashbuckler finesse.</p><p><b>Deeds</b>: The inspired blade gains the following deeds.</p><p><i>Inspired Strike (Ex)</i>: At 11th level, an inspired blade can spend 1 panache point when making an attack with a rapier to gain an insight bonus on that attack roll equal to her Intelligence modifier (minimum bonus +1). When an inspired blade hits with an attack augmented by inspired strike, she can spend 1 additional panache point to make the hit a critical threat, though if she does so, she does not regain panache if she confirms that critical threat. The panache cost of this deed cannot be reduced by abilities such as Signature Deed(UC). This ability replaces bleeding wound.</p><p><b>Rapier Training (Ex)</b>: At 5th level, an inspired blade gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls with rapiers and a +2 bonus on damage rolls with rapiers. While wielding a rapier, she gains the benefit of the Improved Critical feat. These bonuses increase by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 5th (to a maximum of +4 on attack rolls and +5 on damage rolls at 17th level). This ability replaces swashbuckler weapon training.</p><p><b>Rapier Weapon Mastery (Ex)</b>: At 20th level, when an inspired blade threatens a critical hit with a rapier, that critical hit is automatically confirmed. Furthermore, the critical threat range increases by 1 (this increase to the critical threat range stacks with the increase from rapier training, to a total threat range of 14-20), and the critical modifier of the weapon increases by 1 (2 becomes 3, for example). This ability replaces swashbuckler weapon mastery.</p><h1>MOUSER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>In the hands of a trained warrior, a well-sharpened blade is deadly regardless of size. A mouser moves in close, using her size and skill to her advantage.</p><p><b>Deeds</b>: The mouser gains the following deeds.</p><p><i>Underfoot Assault (Ex)</i>: At 1st level, if a foe whose size is larger than the mouser's is adjacent to her and misses her with a melee attack, the mouser can as an immediate action spend 1 panache point to move 5 feet into an area of the attacker's space. This movement does not count against the mouser's movement on her next turn, and it doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. While the mouser is within a foe's space, she is considered to occupy her square within that foe's space.</p><p>While the mouser is within her foe's space, the foe takes a -4 penalty on all attack rolls and combat maneuver checks not made against the mouser, and all of the mouser's allies that are adjacent to both the foe and the mouser are considered to be flanking the foe. The mouser is considered to be flanking the foe whose space she is within if she is adjacent to an ally who is also adjacent to the foe. The mouser can move within her foe's space and leave the foe's space freely (and without provoking attacks of opportunity), but if the foe attempts to move to a position where the mouser is no longer in its space, the movement provokes an attack of opportunity from the mouser. This deed replaces opportune parry and riposte.</p><p><i>Quick Steal (Ex)</i>: At 3rd level, as a swift action the mouser can spend 1 panache point when she hits a foe whose size is larger than her own with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon to attempt a steal combat maneuver check against the creature she hit. Using this deed does not provoke an attack of opportunity. This deed replaces menacing swordplay.</p><p><i>Hamstring (Ex)</i>: At 7th level, as long as a mouser has at least 1 panache point when she hits a foe whose size is larger than her own with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, she can as a swift action attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver check. Instead of the normal conditions that can be applied with dirty trick, this deed can only stagger the target if the check is successful. This deed replaces targeted strike.</p><p><i>Cat's Charge (Ex</i>): At 11th level, as long as a mouser has at least 1 panache point, when she charges a foe whose size is larger than her own, the mouser can end her charge in any space she can reach, not just the closest space. All other requirements of the charge must still be satisfied. This deed replaces bleeding wound.</p><h1>MUSKETEER (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>A number of organizations and kingdoms search for warriors who are brave (or foolish) enough to wield firearms on the battlefield. The daring nature of swashbucklers often makes them ideal candidates for such service.</p><p><b>Weapon Proficiency</b>: A musketeer gains proficiency with all one-handed and two-handed firearms, in addition to the swashbuckler's normal weapon proficiencies. This ability alters the swashbuckler's weapon proficiencies.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Musketeer Instruction (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a musketeer gains the benefits of the Weapon Finesse feature with the rapier (this counts as having the Weapon Finesse feat for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites), as well as both Rapid Reload (musket)(UC) and Gunsmithing(UC) as bonus feats. This ability replaces swashbuckler finesse.</p><p><b>Deed</b>: The musketeer gains the following deed.</p><p><i>Quick Clear (Ex)</i>: At 1st level, as a standard action the musketeer can spend 1 panache point to remove the broken condition from a single firearm he is currently wielding, as long as the firearm gained that condition through a misfire. This deed replaces dodging panache.</p><h1>MYSTERIOUS AVENGER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>While some swashbucklers fight for queen and country, and others for coin, glory, or just the enhancement of their own reputations, the mysterious avenger fights directly for a cause. Instead of gaining personal glory for her heroic deeds, she keeps her identity hidden in order to better fight for those who cannot fight for themselves.</p><p><b>Alignment</b>: A mysterious avenger must be of a good alignment, and must be dedicated to the protection of the good and the powerless under her care. If she ceases to be good or betrays those she was sworn to protect, she loses her secret identity and greater charmed life class features. She can regain them if she atones for her violations through a means the GM agrees is suitable (possibly by way of the <i>atonement</i>spell if the mysterious avenger is religious). This replaces the swashbuckler's alignment.</p><p><b>Class Skills</b>: A mysterious avenger adds Disguise to her list of class skills. This alters the swashbuckler's class skills.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: A mysterious avenger is not proficient with bucklers, but is proficient with whips as exotic weapons. This ability alters the swashbuckler's weapon and armor proficiency.</p><p><b>Avenger Finesse (Ex)</b>: A mysterious avenger gains all of the benefits of the swashbuckler's finesse class feature, and gains the ability to use a whip in place of a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon for all swashbuckler class features and deeds. This ability alters swashbuckler finesse.</p><p><b>Secret Identity (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, a mysterious avenger's force of personality and dedication to her cause give her the ability to keep her true identity secret, even from magical prying. She gains a +4 bonus on Disguise checks for a single disguise of her choice, typically her avenger persona. Once this disguise has been chosen, it can't be changed. She also gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against divination effects. At 11th level, she becomes immune to all <i>scrying</i>effects and other magical effects used in attempts to uncover her secret identity. This ability replaces nimble.</p><p><b>Greater Charmed Life (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, the mysterious avenger gains three extra uses of charmed life. As an immediate action, she can expend one use of charmed life to gain a bonus to her AC equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). She must make this decision before the attack roll is made against her. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 4th level.</p><p><b>Avenger's Target (Ex)</b>: At 5th level, a mysterious avenger gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with light or one-handed piercing melee weapons and whips. Furthermore, a mysterious avenger can study an opponent she can see as a move action. The mysterious avenger then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against that opponent, a +1 bonus on weapon attack rolls and damage rolls against it, and a +1 bonus to the DCs of any deeds used against that opponent. A mysterious avenger can maintain these bonuses against only one opponent at a time; the bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or the mysterious avenger studies a new target.</p><p>At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, these bonuses against a studied target increase by 1. In addition, at each such interval, a mysterious avenger is able to maintain the bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time. A mysterious avenger can discard this connection to a target as a free action, allowing her to study another target in its place.</p><p>At 10th level, a mysterious avenger can study an opponent as a move or swift action. This ability replaces swashbuckler weapon training.</p><h1>PICAROON (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>While some swashbucklers take pride in their ability to wear down an opponent with great skill at arms and clever positioning, others use firearms to get in close and hit hard.</p><p><b>Weapon Proficiency</b>: A picaroon is proficient with all simple weapons and martial weapons, as well as one-handed firearms. This ability replaces the swashbuckler's weapon proficiencies.</p><p><b>Panache</b>: Unlike other swashbucklers, a picaroon regains panache when she confirms a critical hit or makes a killing blow with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon or a one-handed firearm. This ability alters panache.</p><p><b>Deeds</b>: The picaroon gains the following deeds.</p><p><i>Melee Shooter (Ex)</i>: At 1st level, as a swift action when wielding both a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon and a one-handed firearm, the picaroon can spend 1 panache point to avoid provoking attacks of opportunity with the first ranged attack she makes with the firearm during her turn. This deed replaces opportune parry and riposte.</p><p><i>Quick Clear (Ex)</i>: At 3rd level, as a standard action the picaroon can spend 1 panache point to remove the broken condition from a single one-handed firearm she is currently wielding, as long as the firearm gained that condition through a misfire. This deed replaces kip-up.</p><p><i>Gun Feint (Ex)</i>: At 7th level, a picaroon can use the ferocious reputation of firearms to her advantage. A picaroon with at least 1 panache point can feint instead of attacking with her firearm as part of a full attack. She can spend 1 panache point to gain a +5 bonus on the Bluff check. This deed replaces superior feint.</p><p><i>Lightning Reload (Ex)</i>: At 11th level, once per round the picaroon can spend 1 panache point to reload a single barrel of a one-handed firearm as a swift action. If she has the Rapid Reload feat or is using an alchemical cartridge, she can instead reload a single barrel of the weapon as a free action each round. Using this deed doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. This deed replaces bleeding wound.</p><p><b>Two-Weapon Finesse (Ex)</b>: A picaroon gains the benefits of the Weapon Finesse feat with light or one-handed piercing melee weapons. She also gains the effects of the Two-Weapon Fighting feat as long as she is wielding a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon in one hand and one-handed firearm in the other hand. This ability counts as having both the Weapon Finesse and Two-Weapon Fighting feats for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites. This ability replaces swashbuckler finesse.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"is4QklTCm33smBlx"}

A veteran of many brawls against opponents who were suspicious of her manifesting magic, an eldritch scrapper has a thick skin and a fighting style that blends weapons with spells.</p><p><b>Martial Flexibility (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, an eldritch scrapper gains the brawler's martial flexibility class feature, using her sorcerer level as her brawler level to determine uses per day. The scrapper treats Arcane Strike and Combat Casting as combat feats for the purpose of this ability.</p><p>At 9th level, an eldritch scrapper can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She can select one feat as a move action or two feats as a standard action. She can use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means she cannot replace the feat that is currently fulfilling another feat's prerequisites without also replacing all feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p><p>At 15th level, an eldritch scrapper can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. She can select one feat as a swift action, two feats as a move action, or three feats as a standard action. She can use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p><p>This ability replaces the sorcerer's bloodline powers gained 1st, 9th, and 15th levels.</p><p><b>Bloodline Weapons</b>: If an eldritch scrapper's 1st-level bloodline power would normally grant her natural attacks (such as bite or claws), at 3rd level she can select that 1st-level bloodline power in place of her 3rd-level bloodline power.</p><h1>MONGREL MAGE (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>A mongrel mage is a sorcerer whose bloodline is so weak, or mixed with so many others, that her power isn't clearly associated with any bloodline source. A mongrel mage's bloodline powers can change on a daily basis, but always fall short of those of a full-blooded sorcerer. A mongrel mage is a dabbler in all bloodlines but a master of none, and she is looked down upon by true sorcerers.</p><p><b>Mongrel Reservoir (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a mongrel mage has an innate pool of magical energy, known as her mongrel reservoir, that she can draw upon to activate her weakened bloodline. Her mongrel reservoir can hold a number of points of magical energy equal to 3 + her sorcerer level. Each day when she refreshes her spell slots, her mongrel reservoir is restored to its maximum. The mongrel reservoir can never hold more points that the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this maximum are lost.</p><p>Each day when she refreshes her spell slots, the mongrel mage selects one sorcerer bloodline. She must select an ordinary bloodline with this ability, not one altered by the wildblooded archetype or any other archetype. She gains this bloodline's 1st-level bloodline power for that day, using it as if she were only a 1st-level sorcerer. (if this ability is used to gain an arcane bond and the bonded item is selected, she can use the item only to cast a 1st-level spell known, since she counts as only a 1st-level sorcerer.) A mongrel mage can have only one bloodline selected at a time.</p><p>As a swift action, she can expend 1 point from her mongrel reservoir to activate that bloodline, allowing her to use its 1st-level bloodline powers as well as its bloodline arcana at her full sorcerer level, including using a bonded item from an arcane bond. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1).</p><p>At 3rd level, when activating her selected bloodline, a mongrel mage can instead spend 2 points from her mongrel reservoir to allow her to use the bloodline's 1st- and 3rd-level powers as well as its bloodline arcana at her full sorcerer level for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1).</p><p>At 7th level, when a mongrel mage is activating her selected bloodline, the mongrel mage can instead spend 3 points from her mongrel reservoir, allowing her to use the bloodline's 1st-, 3rd-, and 7th-level powers as well as its bloodline arcana at her full sorcerer level for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma bonus.</p><p>At 20th level, when activating her selected bloodline, a mongrel mage can instead spend 5 points from her mongrel reservoir, allowing her to use all of the bloodline's powers as well as its bloodline arcana at her full sorcerer level for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1).</p><p>This ability alters the bloodline class feature, bloodline powers, and bloodline spells.</p><p><b>Bloodline Spells</b>: At 7th level, each day when she selects her bloodline, a mongrel mage adds the 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-level spells from her selected bloodline to her current list of spells known.</p><p>At 13th level, each day when she selects her bloodline, a mongrel mage adds the 4th-, 5th-, and 6th-level spells from her selected bloodline to her current list of spells known.</p><p>At 19th level, each day when she selects her bloodline, a mongrel mage adds the 7th-, 8th-, and 9th-level spells from her selected bloodline to her current list of spells known.</p><p>This ability replaces the bloodline feats gained at 7th, 13th, and 19th level.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"jcL3GElU5zGKuOQa"}

Some of these orders treat combat as an art, while others treat it as an element. The following show examples of both philosophies.</p><h1>KATA MASTER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>The kata master takes the visual aspect of his martial art to its logical extreme, harnessing his flowing movements and skilled maneuvers as a psychological weapon against his enemies. A kata master forsakes the mental discipline of his more contemplative brethren in favor of flamboyant exhibitions. He often performs in staged fights and tournaments, utilizing stylized forms to amaze the audience and shock and dismay his opponents.</p><p><b>Panache</b>: At 1st level, a kata master gains the swashbuckler's panache class feature. At the start of each day, a kata master gains a number of panache points equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 1). His panache goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot exceed his Charisma bonus (minimum 1). A kata master gains the swashbuckler's derring-do and dodging panache deeds. A kata master can use an unarmed strike or a monk special weapon in place of a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon for the purpose of swashbuckler class features and deeds. This ability replaces stunning fist.</p><p><b>Menacing Swordplay (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, a kata master gains the swashbuckler's menacing swordplay deed. This ability replaces still mind.</p><p><b>Ki Pool (Su)</b>: At 4th level, a kata master can treat ki points as panache points for any swashbuckler deed gained through this archetype. This ability modifies ki pool.</p><p><b>Targeted Strike (Ex)</b>: At 7th level, a kata master gains the swashbuckler's targeted strike deed. This ability replaces wholeness of body.</p><p><b>Dizzying Defense (Ex)</b>: At 15th level, a kata master gains the dizzying defense swashbuckler deed. This ability replaces quivering palm.</p><h1>WILDCAT (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>A wildcat is a student of the school of hard knocks who dedicates himself to learning how to take down foes by any means necessary. A wildcat isn't afraid to smash a tankard over a foe's head, stomp an opponent's foot, gouge an eye, or generally create mayhem to gain any possible advantage.</p><p><b>Ready for Anything (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, a wildcat gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and on Perception checks to act in a surprise round. This ability replaces still mind.</p><p><b>Brawler Maneuver Training (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, a wildcat gains additional training with the dirty trick combat maneuver (<i>Advanced Player's Guide</i>320). He gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks when attempting a dirty trick and a +1 bonus to his CMD to resist this maneuver.</p><p>At 7th, 10th, and 16th levels, a wildcat becomes further trained in another combat maneuver, gaining the above +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to his CMD to resist that combat maneuver. In addition, each of the bonuses granted by previous maneuver training increases by 1. For example, when a wildcat reaches 7th level, he gains a +1 bonus on one type of combat maneuver and +1 to his CMD to resist that combat maneuver, and the bonuses for the dirty trick combat maneuver increase to +2.</p><p>This ability replaces ki pool and high jump.</p><p><b>Improvised Weapon Mastery (Ex)</b>: Starting at 4th level, a wildcat's damage with improvised weapons increases. When wielding an improvised weapon, he uses the unarmed strike damage of a monk 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (minimum monk level 1st). For example, a 6th-level Medium wildcat wielding a broken bottle deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon's normal 1d4. If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This increase in damage does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The wildcat can decide to use the weapon's base damage instead of his adjusted unarmed strike damage. This decision must be declared before the attack roll is attempted. This ability replaces slow fall.</p><p><b>Bonus Feat</b>: A wildcat adds the following feats to his list of bonus feats at 6th level: Improved Dirty Trick(APG), Improved Reposition(APG), and Improved Steal(APG). He adds the following feats to his list of bonus feats at 10th level: Quick Dirty Trick(UC), Quick Reposition(UC), and Quick Steal(UC).</p><p><b>Knockout (Ex)</b>: At 9th level, a wildcat can unleash a devastating attack once per day that can instantly knock a target unconscious. He must announce this intent before making his attack roll. If the wildcat's strike is successful and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the wildcat's level + the higher of the wildcat's Strength and Dexterity modifiers) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, an unconscious target can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect; this is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 12th level, a wildcat can use this ability twice per day. This ability replaces improved evasion and abundant step.</p><p><b>Turn the Tables (Ex)</b>: At 13th level, whenever an opponent fails a combat maneuver check against the wildcat, it provokes an attack of opportunity from the wildcat. This ability replaces diamond soul.</p><p><b>Dirty Blow (Ex)</b>: At 19th level, when a wildcat succeeds at a dirty trick combat maneuver, he can deal his unarmed strike damage to that opponent. This ability replaces empty body.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"lV31YW7uce0FG6NF"}

Cut loose from the monastic traditions of their cousins, each brawler demonstrates her prowess in a different way.</p><h1>EXEMPLAR (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>A versatile soldier who inspires her companions with her fighting prowess, an exemplar is at home on the front lines of battles anywhere.</p><p><b>Call to Arms (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, an exemplar can expend a use of martial flexibility to rouse her allies into action. All allies within 30 feet are no longer flat-footed, even if they are surprised. Using this ability is a move action. At 6th level, the exemplar can use it as a swift action instead. At 10th level, she can use it as a free action. At 12th level, she can use it as an immediate action. This ability replaces unarmed strike and close weapon mastery.</p><p><b>Inspiring Prowess (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, an exemplar gains the ability to use certain kinds of bardic performance. She can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier; this number increases by 1 round per brawler level thereafter. The exemplar's effective bard level for this ability is equal to her brawler level - 2. At 3rd level, the exemplar can use inspire courage. At 11th level, the exemplar can use inspire greatness. At 15th level, the exemplar can use inspire heroics. Instead of the Perform skill, she activates this ability with impressive flourishes and displays of martial talent (relying on visual components). This ability otherwise functions as bardic performance; feats and other effects that affect bardic performance (such as the Extra Performance feat) apply to it. This ability replaces maneuver training and AC bonus.</p><p><b>Field Instruction (Ex)</b>: At 5th level, as a standard action, an exemplar can grant a teamwork feat to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear her. This teamwork feat must be one the exemplar knows or has gained with the martial flexibility ability. Allies retain the use of this teamwork feat for 3 rounds + 1 round for every 2 brawler levels. If the granted teamwork feat was gained from martial flexibility, this duration ends immediately if the exemplar loses access to that feat. Allies don't need to meet the prerequisites of this teamwork feat. The exemplar can use this ability once per day at 5th level, plus one additional time per day at 9th, 12th, and 17th level. This ability otherwise counts as the cavalier's tactician class feature; feats and other effects that affect tactician (such as Practiced Tactician) apply to it. This ability replaces brawler's strike.</p><h1>MUTAGENIC MAULER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Not content with perfecting her body through natural methods, a mutagenic mauler resorts to alchemy to unlock the primal beast within.</p><p><b>Mutagen (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a mutagenic mauler discovers how to create a mutagen that she can imbibe in order to heighten her physical prowess, though at the cost of her personality. This ability functions as an alchemist's mutagen and uses the brawler's class level as her alchemist level (alchemist levels stack with brawler levels for determining the effect of this ability). A mutagenic mauler counts as an alchemist for the purpose of imbibing a mutagen prepared by someone else.</p><p>At 6th level, a mutagenic mauler gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls when she attacks in melee while in her mutagenic form. This bonus increases to +3 at 11th level and to +4 at 16th level. At 10th level, a mutagenic mauler learns one of the following alchemist discoveries: feral mutagen(APG), infuse mutagen(APG), preserve organs(UM), spontaneous healing(UM). At 12th level, the mutagenic mauler learns the greater mutagen discovery.</p><p>This ability replaces martial flexibility.</p><p><b>Beastmorph (Su)</b>: Starting at 4th level, a mutagenic mauler gains additional abilities when using her mutagen. At 4th level, she gains low-light vision and a +10 enhancement bonus to her base speed. At 9th level, she gains darkvision to a range of 30 feet and a climb speed of 15 feet. At 13th level, the enhancement bonus to her base speed increases to +15 feet, and she gains the scent ability within 30 feet. At 18th level, her climb speed increases to 30 feet, and the enhancement bonus to her base speed increases to +20 feet. This ability replaces AC bonus.</p><h1>SHIELD CHAMPION (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Stalwart in battle, a shield champion has perfected an entire martial discipline relying only on her hand-to-hand fighting skills and her ever-present shield. What she forgoes in weapon versatility and improved combat maneuvering, she makes up for in her ability to turn her defense into a weapon.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: A shield champion is proficient with all simple weapons and with shields as weapons. She is also proficient with light armor, and with bucklers, light shields, and heavy shields. This ability replaces the brawler's weapon and armor proficiency.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Throw Shield (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, a shield champion can throw a heavy or light shield as a normal (non-improvised) thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet or the shield's range increment, whichever is greater. The thrown shield deals the same damage as a shield bash, and any damage increases from shield spikes apply to this attack. A shield champion is treated as having the Far Shot feat for the purpose of determining range increment penalties for throwing a shield.</p><p>At 7th level, a shield champion can use a thrown shield to perform a bull rush, dirty trick, disarm, reposition, or trip combat maneuver as if she were making a melee shield bash attack. At 11th level, a shield champion gains Shield Master as a bonus feat. She must meet the prerequisites before taking that feat.</p><p>This ability replaces maneuver training at 3rd, 7th, and 11th levels.</p><p><b>Returning Shield (Ex)</b>: At 5th level, a shield champion can throw a shield so it ricochets off her target (and possibly other solid objects) to return to her at the end of her turn. This ability functions whether or not the shield champion hits her opponent or moves on her turn. The shield deals no damage to targets it bounces off, other than the original target of the shield champion's attack. Certain circumstances can prevent the shield from returning to the shield champion, such as an opponent using a readied action to catch the shield, or the shield sticking to a mimic's adhesive. The shield champion can opt to not have a thrown shield return to her, in which case it falls to the ground as it normally would. If the shield has the <i>returning</i>ranged weapon special ability, she can use either that or this ability.</p><p>If a shield champion has additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, these additional attacks can be ricochets off an earlier target. The distance to each additional target counts toward the total range of the shield, and range penalties apply, but there are no additional penalties for attacking in this manner. Because ricocheting attacks are treated as separate attacks, effects and modifiers that apply to only one attack roll (such as <i>true strike</i>) apply to only the first attack and not to the others. A shield champion can throw a shield as part of a brawler's flurry.</p><p>At 9th level, a shield champion gains Greater Shield Focus as a bonus feat. She must meet the prerequisites before taking that feat. At 12th level, a shield champion can use her unarmed strike damage when dealing damage with a shield (whether in melee or as a thrown weapon) or the shield's damage, whichever is greater. At 17th level, by ricocheting her shield off a nearby surface before hitting her intended target, she can treat that surface as the origin square of the attack to determine whether the target is flanked and whether the target gains a cover bonus to its AC. She can use this ability to attack a creature with total concealment from her if she knows what square it occupies, but the attack still has a 50% miss chance. This ability replaces brawler's strike.</p><p><b>Champion Defense (Ex)</b>: At 15th level, once per day when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat from a weapon, unarmed, or natural attack, the shield champion can attempt to absorb all the damage with her shield. To use this ability, the shield champion must attempt a Fortitude saving throw, with the DC equal to the damage dealt. If it succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; otherwise, she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to use this ability-if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can't use this ability. At 19th level, she can use this ability twice per day. This ability replaces the maneuver training gained at 15th and 19th levels.</p><h1>SNAKEBITE STRIKER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>With her lightning quickness and guile, a snakebite striker keeps her foes' attention focused on her, because any one of her feints might be an actual attack. By giving up some of a brawler's versatility, she increases her damage potential and exposes her opponents to deadly and unexpected strikes.</p><p><b>Class Skills</b>: A snakebite striker gains Bluff and Stealth as class skills, but does not gain Intimidate as a class skill.</p><p><b>Sneak Attack (Ex)</b>: A snakebite striker can make a sneak attack, as per the rogue class feature of the same name. At 1st level, her sneak attack damage is 1d6. This extra damage increases by 1d6 at 6th, 10th, 12th, and 20th levels. If she gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack. This ability replaces martial flexibility.</p><p><b>Snake Feint (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, a snakebite striker who uses a standard action to feint can move as part of that action. If she is able to feint as a move action (such as from having the Improved Feint feat), she can feint and move in the same action. At 11th level, once per round she can declare her square and one adjacent square as the origin of her attacks until her next turn (allowing her to use one or both squares to determine whether she or her allies are flanking an opponent). At 15th level, she counts an additional adjacent square for this purpose. This ability replaces the maneuver training gained at 3rd and 7th levels.</p><p><b>Opportunist (Ex)</b>: At 11th level, once per round, a snakebite striker can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another character. This attack counts as an attack of opportunity for that round. She cannot use this ability more than once per round, even if she has the Combat Reflexes feat or a similar ability. At 19th level, she can use this ability twice per round. This ability replaces the maneuver training gained at 11th and 19th levels.</p><h1>STEEL-BREAKER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>The steel-breaker studies destruction and practices it as an art form. She knows every defense has a breaking point, and can shatter those defenses with carefully planned strikes.</p><p><b>Class Skills</b>: The steel-breaker gains Knowledge (engineering) as a class skill, and does not gain Knowledge (dungeoneering) as a class skill.</p><p><b>Exploit Weakness (Ex)</b>: At 5th level, as a swift action a steel-breaker can observe a creature or an object and find its weak point by succeeding at a Wisdom check, adding her brawler level as a bonus on the check, against a DC of 10 + either the object's hardness or the target's CR. If she succeeds, the steel-breaker gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls until the end of her turn, and any attacks she makes until the end of her turn ignore the creature's or object's DR or hardness.</p><p>A steel-breaker can instead use this ability as a swift action to analyze the movements and expressions of one creature within 30 feet, granting a bonus on Sense Motive checks and Reflex saving throws, as well as a dodge bonus to AC against that opponent equal to 1/2 her brawler level until the start of her next turn. This ability replaces brawler's strike.</p><p><b>Sunder Training (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, a steel-breaker receives additional training in sunder combat maneuvers. She gains a +2 bonus when attempting sunder combat maneuver checks and a +2 bonus to her CMD when defending against this maneuver. At 7th level, these bonuses increase by 1, and she gains a +2 bonus on disarm combat maneuver checks and a +2 bonus to her CMD when defending against a disarm combat maneuver. At 11th, 15th, and 19th levels, all of these bonuses increase by 1. This ability replaces maneuver training.</p><h1>STRANGLER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>A strangler is trained to choke the life out of her victims with her vise-like grip. Some stranglers are self-taught and are little more than brutish murderers, unhinged sociopaths, or opportunistic alley-bashers. Others are members of murder cults or specialized schools of assassination, trained since childhood to kill with their bare hands.</p><p><b>Class Skills</b>: A strangler gains Stealth as a class skill.</p><p><b>Strangle (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a strangler deals 1d6 points of sneak attack damage (as per the rogue ability of the same name) whenever she succeeds at a grapple combat maneuver check to damage or pin an opponent. The strangler is always considered to be flanking her target for the purpose of using this ability. This damage increases by 1d6 at 2nd, 8th, and 15th levels. This ability replaces unarmed strike and brawler's flurry.</p><p><b>Practiced Strangler (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, when a strangler has the grappled condition, she does not take a -4 penalty to Dexterity and does not lose her Dexterity bonus to AC. At 9th level, a grappling or grappled strangler still threatens an area and is still able to make attacks of opportunity while grappling or grappled; when pinned, she is not denied her Dexterity bonus and does not take a -4 penalty to Armor Class. This ability replaces AC bonus.</p><p><b>Sleeper Hold (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, a strangler can instantly render a pinned opponent unconscious. This works like the knockout ability, but requires a successful grapple combat maneuver check against the pinned opponent and does not have to damage the opponent. Creatures that do not need to breathe, are immune to critical hits, or are immune to nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, a strangler can use this ability twice per day. At 16th level, she can use it three times per day. This ability alters knockout.</p><p><b>Neckbreaker (Ex)</b>: At 16th level, a strangler can attempt to instantly kill a pinned opponent as a standard action. This works like the sleeper hold ability, but imposes a -5 penalty on her grapple combat maneuver check. If the opponent succeeds at its Fortitude save, the strangler deals damage as if she had attempted the grapple check to damage her opponent; if the opponent fails its Fortitude save, it dies. Creatures that are immune to critical hits are immune to this ability. At 20th level, the strangler can use this ability as a move action instead of a standard action. This ability replaces awesome blow and improved awesome blow.</p><h1>WILD CHILD (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>The wild child works with his sworn animal friend to conquer the challenges that lay before them. This kinship could come from being lost in the wilderness and raised by animals or growing up with an exotic pet.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Class Skills</b>: A wild child gains Heal as a class skill.</p><p><b>Animal Companion (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a wild child forms a bond with a loyal companion that accompanies the wild child on his adventures. A wild child can begin play with any of the animals available to a druid. The wild child uses his brawler level as his effective druid level for determining the abilities of his animal companion. This ability replaces the bonus combat feats gained at 2nd, 8th, 14th, and 20th levels.</p><p><b>Hunter's Tricks</b>: At 5th level, a wild child can expend one use of martial flexibility to use a trick from the ranger skirmisher archetype (<i>Advanced Player's Guide</i>128). Each time he activates this ability, the wild child can use a different trick. He cannot choose any tricks that rely on ranged attacks. Activating this ability is not an action, but using the trick might require the wild child to use an action of a different type. This ability replaces close weapon mastery.</p><p><b>Maneuver Training (Ex)</b>: Whenever the wild child chooses a new maneuver for this ability, his animal companion also learns a trick that makes use of this combat maneuver. For example, if the wild child chooses maneuver training (dirty trick), his animal companion also learns a trick that allows it to use the dirty trick combat maneuver. He cannot choose any tricks that rely on ranged attacks. This bonus trick doesn't count against the animal companion's total tricks known and does not take any time or checks to train. Should the wild child gain a new animal companion (such as if the previous one dies), this new animal companion begins with the same number of bonus tricks. This ability alters maneuver training.</p><p><b>Wild Tricks (Ex)</b>: The wild child has learned a number of tricks to aid his allies and his animal companion, as well as to hinder his opponents. At 5th level and every 6 levels thereafter, the wild child learns one hunter's trick. He cannot choose any tricks that rely on ranged attacks. The wild child can use these tricks a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his brawler level + his Constitution modifier. This ability otherwise follows the rules of the hunter's tricks ability, including all action costs. This ability replaces the bonus combat feats gained at 5th, 11th, and 17th levels.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"oAE3dyR6fEyQqHiX"}

His weapon is likely to find purchase in his favored enemy.</p><p><b>Alignment</b>: A divine tracker's alignment must be within one step of his deity's, along either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis. This replaces the ranger's alignment.</p><p><b>Favored Weapon</b>: At 1st level, a divine tracker is proficient with the favored weapon of his deity. If his deity's favored weapon is unarmed strike, he instead gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. This ability replaces wild empathy.</p><p><b>Blessings (Su)</b>: At 4th level, a divine tracker forms a close bond with his deity's ethos. He selects two warpriest blessings from among those granted by his deity and gains their minor powers. A divine tracker can select an alignment blessing (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if his alignment matches that blessing. If a divine tracker isn't devoted to a particular deity, he still selects two blessings to represent his spiritual inclinations and abilities, subject to GM discretion. The restriction on alignment blessings still applies. A divine tracker uses his ranger level as his warpriest level to determine the effects of blessings. At 13th level, a divine tracker gains the major powers of his blessings. This ability replaces hunter's bond.</p><h1>HOODED CHAMPION (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>The hooded champion lives on the periphery of civilized lands, and is often at odds with the forces of law and order. He is frequently a hero of oppressed peoples, lurking in the woods near their homes and trying to right the injustices inflicted upon them by the wealthy and powerful.</p><p><b>Panache (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, the hooded champion gains the swashbuckler's panache class feature. He regains panache by scoring critical hits and killing blows when using a bow of any kind, rather than when using a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon. If the hooded champion has this ability and the panache ability from another class or archetype, the panache points from the two sources do not stack, but the hooded champion regains panache in any way either class feature allows him to. For example, a character with a Charisma score of 16 who has both the hooded champion's and the swashbuckler's panache has a base of 3 panache points, and regains panache from critical hits and killing blows by scoring with either a bow or a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon. This ability replaces favored enemy at 1st level.</p><p><b>Deeds</b>: At 1st level, the hooded champion gains the swashbuckler's derring-do and dodging panache deeds. He also gains the deeds below at the levels indicated. For all deeds, treat the hooded champion's ranger level as his swashbuckler level.</p><p><i>Dead Aim (Ex)</i>: At 1st level, the hooded champion can spend 1 panache point when making a single ranged attack (not a full attack) with a bow to make a ranged touch attack instead. The target must be in the bow's first range increment.</p><p>At 3rd level, the hooded champion gains the swashbuckler's kip-up deed as well as the following deed.</p><p><i>Hooded Champion's Initiative (Ex)</i>: At 3rd level, while the hooded champion has at least 1 panache point, he gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. Also, if he has the Quick Draw feat, his hands are free and unrestrained, and his weapon isn't hidden, then he can draw a single bow as part of the initiative check.</p><p><b>Combat Style</b>: At 2nd level, the hooded champion must select the archery combat style. At 9th level, the hooded champion gains the swashbuckler's grace and evasive deeds. At 16th level, the hooded champion gains the swashbuckler's edge and cheat death deeds. This ability replaces wild empathy, endurance, evasion, and improved evasion.</p><h1>WILD HUNTER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>A wild hunter seeks to emulate the animals around him to keep him safe while he tracks his prey. Instead of studying the traits and behaviors of a favored enemy, a wild hunter studies those of various animals, incorporating those attributes into his hunting strategy.</p><p><b>Animal Focus (Su)</b>: At 1st level, as a swift action a wild hunter can take on the aspect of an animal, gaining a bonus or a special ability based on the type of animal emulated. This ability functions as the hunter's animal focus class feature (see page 27), though it applies only to the wild hunter and not an animal companion (see shared focus, below). The wild hunter can use this ability for 1 minute per day per ranger level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. He can emulate only one animal at a time. This ability replaces favored enemy.</p><p><b>Shared Focus (Su)</b>: At 7th level, a wild hunter can share his current animal focus with one creature appropriate to his hunter's bond. If the wild hunter's bond is with an animal companion, the companion automatically gains the benefits of the wild hunter's current animal focus. If the wild hunter's bond is with his companions, as a swift action he can select one bonded ally to gain the benefits of the wild hunter's current animal focus; these benefits last until the hunter's bond ends, the animal focus ends for the wild hunter, or the wild hunter selects a different companion. This ability replaces woodland stride and swift tracker.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"oDON481aGwyqUr71"}

{"name":"Druid Archetype","permission":{"default":0,"JgpLZkPryhl1EFab":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_zrrxjaps56","path":"Pathfinder RPG - Advanced Class Guide Reference Library#/CF_SEP/ADVANCED CLASS GUIDE#/CF_SEP/CHAPTER 2: ARCHETYPES AND CLASS OPTIONS","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\"></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Nature is harsh, often wrathful, and always wild. Druids not only worship nature, they often serve as the living incarnations of its unquestioning essence-for good or for ill.</p><h1>FERAL SHIFTER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>A feral shifter internalizes her communion with and mastery over animals. Instead of forming a bond with an animal companion or an aspect of nature, she alters her own essence or being in an homage to the noble creatures of the wild. More in tune with transformation and animal bodies than a normal druid is, a feral shifter blurs the line between humanoid and beast.</p><p><b>Animal Focus (Su)</b>: At 1st level, as a swift action, a feral shifter can take on the aspect of an animal, gaining a bonus or a special ability based on the type of animal emulated. This functions as the hunter's animal focus class feature (see page 27). The feral shifter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her druid level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. She can emulate only one animal at a time. This ability replaces nature bond.</p><p><b>Second Animal Focus (Su)</b>: At 9th level, when a feral shifter uses her animal focus ability, she applies two animal aspects to herself instead of one. This ability replaces venom immunity, a thousand faces, and timeless body.</p><h1>NATURE FANG (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>A nature fang is a druid who stalks and slays those who despoil nature, kill scarce animals, or introduce diseases to unprotected habitats. She gives up a close empathic connection with the natural world to become its deadly champion and avenger.</p><p><b>Studied Target (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a nature fang gains the slayer's studied target class feature. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the nature fang's bonus against her studied target increases by 1. Unlike a slayer, a nature fang does not gain the ability to maintain more than one studied target at the same time. This ability replaces nature sense, wild empathy, and woodland stride.</p><p><b>Slayer Talent</b>: At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a nature fang selects a slayer talent. Starting at 12th level, she can select an advanced slayer talent in place of a slayer talent. She uses her druid level as her slayer level to determine what talents she can select. This ability replaces wild shape.</p><p><b>Sneak Attack (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, a nature fang gains sneak attack +1d6. This ability functions as the rogue sneak attack class feature. If the nature fang gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack. This ability replaces resist nature's lure.</p><p><b>Swift Studied Target</b>: At 9th level, a nature fang can study an opponent as a move or swift action. This ability replaces venom immunity.</p><p><b>Slayer Talents</b>: The following slayer talents complement the nature fang archetype: foil scrutiny, poison use, and ranger combat style. Additionally, the following rogue talents, which are also available to slayers, complement the archetype: bleeding attack, camouflage(APG), fast stealth, finesse rogue, lasting poison(APG), rogue crawl, slow reactions, surprise attack, swift poison(APG), and terrain mastery(UC).</p><p><b>Advanced Talents</b>: The following slayer advanced talents complement the nature fang archetype: assassinate, slayer camouflage, and woodland stride. The rogue advanced talent master of disguise(APG) also fits the archetype.</p><h1>WILD WHISPERER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>A wild whisperer is an expert at studying, predicting, and explaining animal behavior. She is less interested in plants, fey, and other aspects of the natural world, and uses her gifts to tame or relocate dangerous beasts and soothe the hurts of wounded and sickly creatures.</p><p><b>Inspiration (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, a wild whisperer gains an inspiration pool as the investigator class feature (see page 31). A wild whisperer uses her druid level as her investigator level when determining the effects of this ability. Instead of free uses of inspiration on Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft checks, the wild whisperer can use inspiration on Handle Animal, Heal, Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (nature), Ride, Sense Motive, and Survival checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided she's trained in the relevant skill. She can also use inspiration on any wild empathy check without expending a use of inspiration. A wild whisperer's inspiration pool refreshes each day when she prepares spells. This ability replaces woodland stride, trackless step, and resist nature's lure.</p><p><b>Wild Shape (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, a wild whisperer gains the wild shape ability, but she never gains access to any forms beyond Small and Medium animal forms, as <i>beast shape I</i>. This ability alters wild shape.</p><p><b>Natural Expertise (Ex)</b>: At 6th level, a wild whisperer's powers of observation give her an advantage when she's fighting natural creatures. When using inspiration on an attack roll against an animal or a vermin, or on a saving throw against an effect from an animal or a vermin, a wild whisperer has to expend only one use of inspiration instead of two. This ability replaces the additional use of wild shape at 6th level.</p><p><b>Investigator Talent</b>: At 8th level, wild whisperer selects an investigator talent (see page 32). This ability replaces the additional use of wild shape at 8th level.</p><p><b>Investigator Talents</b>: The following investigator talents complement the wild whisperer archetype: amazing inspiration, effortless aid, eidetic recollection, empathy, inspirational expertise, inspired alertness, inspired intimidator, perceptive tracking, and tenacious inspiration.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^ Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"vT2VJjN5aSX1L3Ls"}

<text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>CLASS FEATURES</h1><p>The following are the class features of the bloodrager.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: Bloodragers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A bloodrager can cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic components.</p><p><b>Bloodline</b>: Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family's past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p><p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager's alignment doesn't restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn't dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p><p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character's bloodrager level as the caster level.</p><p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.</p><p>At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an additional spell derived from his bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1-4. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p><p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his previous bloodline to make them conform.</p><p><b>Bloodrage (Su)</b>: The bloodrager's source of internal power grants him the ability to bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like <i>bear's endurance</i>) don't increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours don't need to be consecutive.</p><p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, he takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p><p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he's fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter a bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p><p>Bloodrage counts as the barbarian's rage class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p><p><b>Fast Movement (Ex)</b>: A bloodrager's base speed is faster than is normal for his race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the bloodrager's speed due to any armor worn or load carried. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the bloodrager's base speed.</p><p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, a bloodrager can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A bloodrager with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.</p><p>If a bloodrager already possesses uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p><p><b>Blood Sanctuary (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, due to the power of his blood, a bloodrager can stand confidently amid the effects of spells cast by himself or his allies. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells that he or an ally casts.</p><p><b>Blood Casting (Su)</b>: At 4th level, the bloodrager gains the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. He can also cast these spells defensively and can attempt concentration checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, he can cast and concentrate on only his bloodrager spells (see below); spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state.</p><p><b>Eschew Materials</b>: At 4th level, the bloodrager gains Eschew Materials as a bonus feat.</p><p><b>Spells</b>: Beginning at 4th level, a bloodrager gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from the bloodrager spell list (see page 22). To learn or cast a spell, a bloodrager must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows without preparing them ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a bloodrager's spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager's Charisma modifier.</p><p>Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-3. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 on page 17 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>). The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn't yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.</p><p>The bloodrager's selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on Table 1-4. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his Charisma score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline. At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a sorcerer.</p><p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</b>: At 5th level, a bloodrager can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues (or other classes with the sneak attack ability) the ability to sneak attack the bloodrager by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels (or levels in the class granting sneak attack) than the target has bloodrager levels.</p><p>If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack when determining the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p><p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex</b>): At 7th level, a bloodrager gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the bloodrager takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage reduction increases by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0.</p><p><b>Greater Bloodrage (Su)</b>: At 11th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +3. In addition, upon entering a bloodrage, the bloodrager can apply the effects a bloodrager spell he knows of 2nd level or lower to himself. The spell must have a range of touch or personal. If the spell's duration is greater than 1 round, it instead lasts for the duration of the bloodrage. This use consumes a bloodrager spell slot, as if he had cast the spell; he must have the spell slot available to take advantage of this effect.</p><p>Greater bloodrage counts as the barbarian's greater rage ability for the purposes of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p><p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex)</b>: At 14th level, a bloodrager gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells while bloodraging. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his bloodrage.</p><p><b>Tireless Bloodrage (Su)</b>: At 17th level, a bloodrager no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his bloodrage.</p><p><b>Mighty Bloodrage (Su)</b>: At 20th level, when a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution increases to +8, and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +4. Furthermore, the spell he can apply to himself at the beginning of a bloodrage due to the greater bloodrage class feature is not limited to only spells of 2nd level or lower.</p></text>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1classes\">^Classes</text>\n <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">Archetypes and Class Options</text2>\n <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>","_id":"yl3WaiZeob0OVdZw"}
