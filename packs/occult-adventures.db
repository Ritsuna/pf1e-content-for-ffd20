Loci spirits typically arise in places with connections to previous miracles, benevolent guardian spirits, or good-aligned deities. Loci spirits infuse a specific area; their psychic energy heightens the positive emotions experienced there to create a feeling of peace and protection. A loci spirit also manifests a unique ceremonial power linked specifically to the emotional energy that birthed the spirit. Except in rare circumstances, a given area can house at most one loci spirit.</p><p>Loci Spirit Rules</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>The emanating feelings of peace and protective warmth make a loci spirit obvious to those within its area. A loci spirit is always LG, NG, or CG in alignment and has the aura of a good outsider for the purposes of <i>detect good </i>and similar magic.</p><p>A loci spirit can infuse an area with a maximum radius of 5 feet x the spirit's CR, but the actual area is usually limited by the size and shape of the area tied to the spirit's origin.</p><p><b>Permanent Effects</b>: A loci spirit generates at least one of the three following permanent effects within the area it inhabits. A loci spirit may possess an additional ongoing permanent effect, and each effect beyond the first increases the loci spirit's CR by 1.</p><p><i>Energized</i>: The DC to resist positive channeled energy within the loci spirit's area gains a +4 sacred bonus, and the DC to resist negative energy is reduced by 4. Spell resistance does not apply to this effect.</p><p><i>Protective</i>: The loci spirit's area is warded by a <i>magic circle against evil </i>effect.</p><p><i>Sacred</i>: Every undead creature entering the area of a loci spirit takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws.</p><p>In addition to the permanent effect, each loci spirit has a ceremonial effect that another creature can activate by performing a specific ceremonial activity. Knowledge of the appropriate ceremony to activate a loci spirit's ceremonial effect is rare and can be a reward in its own right, but the GM can allow a creature to attempt a Knowledge (planes) or Knowledge (religion) check, as appropriate, with a DC equal to 20 + the loci spirit's CR to gain clues about or even fully determine the details of the ceremony.</p><p>The ceremony to manifest a loci spirit's ceremonial effect requires the celebrant to perform each of the requisite skill checks detailed in the loci spirit's stat block. When the celebrant successfully completes the ceremony, the loci spirit immediately manifests its effect.</p><p><b>Manifestation Type</b>: Each loci spirit's ceremonial effect has one of the following manifestation types.</p><p><i>Singular</i>: The effect targets or affects only the celebrant.</p><p><i>Coterie</i>: The effect targets all creatures in the loci spirit's area or is potentially useful to creatures other than the celebrant (for instance, creating something that anyone could use would be a coterie manifestation).</p><p><i>Boon</i>: The effect targets all creatures in the loci spirit's area with a boon allowing affected characters to use the effect within the next 24 hours as an immediate action. A creature can benefit from only one boon from a loci spirit at a time.</p><p>After a loci spirit manifests its ceremonial effect, or after a failed ceremony, the spirit can't manifest the effect again for another 24 hours.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Table 6-1: CR Modifiers for Loci Spirits</h1><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Feature Type</b></td><td><b>CR Modifier</b></td></tr><tr><td>Ceremony requires more than 1 skill check</td><td>+1 for each additional skill check</td></tr><tr><td>Permanent effects</td><td>+1 for each additional permanent effect beyond the first</td></tr><tr><td>Singular</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>Coterie</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Boon</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Hard to heal(1)</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>Susceptible to corruption(2)</td><td>-1</td></tr></table><p><b>(1) Loci spirits that are hard to heal gain only half the normal amount of hit points from effects that restore hit points.</b></p><p><b>(2) Loci spirits that are susceptible to corruption lose twice the amount of hit points from corrupting actions.</b></p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Corruption</h1><p>Loci spirits can't be damaged conventionally, but are susceptible to corruption if certain actions occur within their areas. Each loci spirit has a number of hit points equal to twice its CR, which it uses to resist corruption. Certain particularly vile acts reduce a loci spirit's hit points and bring it closer to corruption, while certain acts of good can restore hit points and protect the loci spirit from corruption.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Act</b></td><td><b>Effect</b></td></tr><tr><td>Committing a violent act</td><td>Reduces hit points by 1</td></tr><tr><td>Committing murder</td><td>Reduces hit points by 1 for every 3 Hit Dice of the victim (minimum 1 hit point)</td></tr><tr><td>Casting <i>animate dead </i></td><td>Reduces hit points by 1 per undead created</td></tr><tr><td>Casting <i>create undead</i> or <i>create greater undead </i></td><td>Reduces hit points by 1 per level of spell cast</td></tr><tr><td>Summoning an evil outsider</td><td>Reduces hit points by 1 per evil outsider summoned</td></tr><tr><td>Calling an evil outsider</td><td>Reduces hit points by 1 per level of spell cast</td></tr><tr><td>Casting <i>desecrate</i></td><td>Reduces hit points by 2</td></tr><tr><td>Casting <i>unhallow</i></td><td>Reduces hit points by 4</td></tr><tr><td>Successfully performing the loci spirit's ceremony</td><td>Restores 2 hit points</td></tr><tr><td>Casting <i>consecrate</i></td><td>Restores 2 hit points (maximum once per day)</td></tr><tr><td>Casting <i>hallow</i></td><td>Restores 4 hit points</td></tr></table></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>If a loci spirit is reduced to 0 hit points, it becomes corrupted; thereafter, it acts as a haunt (<i>GameMastery Guide </i>242) of the same CR and loses any loci spirit permanent effects. Once a loci spirit has been corrupted, its effects instead manifest as mind-affecting fear effects. These new effects should have a similar power level to that of the ceremonial effect the loci spirit previously manifested. A corrupted loci spirit has the aura of an evil outsider for the purposes of <i>detect evil </i>and similar effects. Unlike a haunt, a corrupted loci spirit can't take the tricked by <i>hide from undead </i>weakness, but it can take most other haunt modifiers as long as its CR remains the same. The haunt has the same number of hit points as the loci spirit originally did; these are separate from its loci spirit hit points, which remain at 0 until the loci spirit is purified.</p><p>Corrupted loci spirits can be neutralized or destroyed in the same fashion as haunts. While a corrupted loci spirit is inactive because of being neutralized, characters can use effects that restore a loci spirit's hit points to attempt to purify it (see the table in the previous column). For the purpose of purification, increasing the loci spirit's hit points does not restore the haunt's hit points. If a character manages to restore the full hit points of the uncorrupted loci spirit, the character has purged the corruption entirely, and the loci spirit returns to its former benevolence. This could potentially occur over the course of multiple encounters with the corrupted spirit. Until then, the haunt continues to reset.</p><h1>Elements of a Loci Spirit</h1><p>Loci spirits are presented in the following format.</p><p><b>Loci Spirit Name</b>: The loci spirit's name is followed by its CR.</p><p><b>XP</b>: This is the amount of XP to award the PCs for surviving the loci spirit's corrupted form, as determined by the spirit's CR. At the GM's discretion, characters who intentionally corrupt a loci spirit in pursuit of their goals may receive this amount of XP for doing so.</p><p><b>Alignment, Permanent Effects, Manifestation Type, and Area</b>: This line gives the loci spirit's alignment, its permanent effects and manifestation type, and the dimensions of the area it infuses (up to 5 feet per caster level).</p><p><b>Caster Level</b>: This is the loci spirit's effective caster level for the purposes of dispelling any ongoing effects with <i>dispel magic</i>, and for determining the results of spell effects it creates.</p><p><b>hp</b>: This lists the loci spirit's effective hit points for the purposes of resolving corruption. A loci spirit's number of hit points is equal to twice the spirit's CR.</p><p><b>Weakness</b>: Any weaknesses the loci spirit has, such as being susceptible to corruption or hard to heal, are listed here.</p><p><b>Ceremony</b>: These are the skill checks that must be performed in order for the loci spirit to manifest its ceremonial effect.</p><p><b>Effect</b>: This entry details the ceremonial effect of the loci spirit, and includes a description of how the loci spirit manifests.</p><p><b>Corruption Effect</b>: This entry gives a brief description of what the loci spirit's effects become if it is corrupted.</p><h1>Creating a Loci Spirit</h1><p>To make your own loci spirit like the examples below, follow these steps.</p><p><b>Step 1-Determine Base CR</b>: A loci spirit's base CR is equal to 1 + the level of the spell it duplicates.</p><p><b>Step 2-Determine Actual CR</b>: Select the elements you want the loci spirit to have and add up the adjustments to its CR to arrive at the loci spirit's final CR (see Table 6-1: CR Modifiers for Loci Spirits).</p><p><b>Step 3-Determine Caster Level</b>: A loci spirit's caster level is equal to its CR.</p><p><b>Step 4-Determine Hit Points</b>: A loci spirit's hit points are equal to twice its CR.</p><p><b>Step 5-Determine Ceremony DC</b>: The ceremony check DC is equal to 20 + the loci spirit's CR.</p><p><b>Step 6-Save DCs</b>: If a loci spirit's ceremonial effect allows a saving throw to resist or negate the effect, the save DC is equal to 10 + the level of the spell + the ability modifier of the minimum ability score needed to cast that level of spell. Normally, the ceremonial effect is harmless and thus applies only if a creature voluntarily wishes to resist or negate the effect.</p><p><b>Step 7-Determine Corruption Effect, Attack, and Save DCs</b>: A corrupted loci spirit manifests a mind-affecting fear effect with the same spell level as its unique effect. A corrupted loci spirit's attack bonus (if needed) is usually equal to its CR.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>BENEVOLENT PRIEST CR 5</h1><p><b>XP 1,600 </b></p><p>NG protective coterie loci spirit (10-ft.-by-10-ft. room)</p><p><b>Caster Level </b>5th</p><p><b>hp </b>10; <b>Ceremony </b>Knowledge (religion) DC 25, Survival DC 25</p><p><b>Effect </b>When the celebrant performs the appropriate offering of twigs and berries, the loci spirit manifests as a ghostly, rotund man in clerical garb bearing trays of food, which he offers to the celebrant and its allies, as the <i>create food and water </i>spell.</p><p><b>Corruption Effect </b><i>Create food and water </i>becomes <i>contagion </i>(DC 14).</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>GHOSTLY WARRIORS CR 5</h1><p><b>XP 1,600 </b></p><p>LG sacred boon loci spirit (5-ft. radius centered on the shrine)</p><p><b>Caster Level </b>5th</p><p><b>hp </b>10; <b>Ceremony </b>Diplomacy DC 25, Perform (oratory) DC 25</p><p><b>Effect </b>Invoking the ceremony with pomp and vigor rouses a cadre of ghostly figures in ancient armor that kneel before all creatures in the loci spirit's area of effect and present their weapons, granting a boon of <i>align weapon </i>(each recipient's choice of lawful or good only).</p><p><b>Corruption Effect </b><i>Align weapon </i>becomes <i>shatter </i>(DC 13).</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>HERO'S CALL CR 4</h1><p><b>XP 1,200 </b></p><p>CG energized singular loci spirit (15-ft. radius centered on the hero's statue)</p><p><b>Caster Level </b>4th</p><p><b>hp </b>8; <b>Ceremony </b>Knowledge (history) DC 24, Perform (oratory) DC 24</p><p><b>Effect </b>The celebrant entreats the brave hero from the ancient past, recalling the hero's great deeds and requesting some of the hero's strength for the celebrant's own quest.

{"name":"New Haunt Rules","permission":{"default":0,"JgpLZkPryhl1EFab":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_4751keynkw3","path":"Pathfinder RPG - Occult Adventures Reference Library#/CF_SEP/Occult Adventures#/CF_SEP/CHAPTER 6: RUNNING AN OCCULT GAME","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\"></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>The <i>GameMastery Guide </i>introduced rules for creating haunts. While haunts can be complex antagonists, they are versatile tools that are well suited to portray the drama and atmosphere of occult games. This section presents new haunt rules and clarifications on previous rules.</p><h1>Holy Water</h1><p>While haunts are typically damaged only by applied positive energy, holy water is another potential weapon against them. A flask (1 pint) of holy water that successfully hits a haunt as a splash weapon deals 2d4 points of damage to the haunt on a direct hit, and deals 1 point of damage to haunts within 5 feet of the splash radius.</p><h1>Item-Bound and Possessing Haunts</h1><p>Some haunts are tied to special objects or creatures. Such haunts take normal damage from positive energy, and follow the normal reset rules for haunts of their type. <i>Dispel evil </i>can eject a haunting presence if the spell is cast quickly; the caster must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 + the haunt's CR + 1 for each month that the creature or object has been possessed.</p><p>Bound haunts possess items when created, and gain mobility at the cost of having their tragic fates tied to physical objects that are more easily destroyed. These haunts spontaneously manifest at scenes of great terror, as the psychic residue of tragic events seeps into items tied to the events. Once bound to an item, an item-bound haunt uses all of the normal rules for haunts, with the radius of its effects centered on the haunted object. Some effects may have special triggers based on the item's nature, such as haunted instruments being played or weapons being used. The haunting presence adds 5 to the break DC for its possessed item, and doubles the item's hardness and hit points.</p><p>Malevolent spirits may similarly haunt creatures rather than items, following the subjects wherever they go and causing strange occurrences and poltergeist-like activity around the subject in revenge for a perceived trespass or involvement in the tragic events that created the haunt. While they sometimes seem beneficial to their hosts at first, such haunts inevitably seek their hosts' destruction. Individuals possessed by such haunts must always take a standard action to retrieve stored items, unless it would normally take longer. In addition, any item the host drops lands 10 feet away in a random direction. A possessing haunt uses all normal rules for haunts, with the radius of its effects centered on the haunted subject, who takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws against the haunt's effects. Subject to the GM's discretion, haunted creatures may suffer tormenting dreams that cause 1 point of drain each day to an ability score appropriate for the haunt.</p><h1>Chained Haunts</h1><p>Some haunts are intrinsically connected with incorporeal undead entities (most commonly ghosts) and manifest as displays of the associated creatures' fractured psyches. Chained haunts can be destroyed only by bringing final rest to their connected entities. Chained haunts can be used to illustrate and emphasize a ghost's tragic story. For example, a series of chained haunts could be spread across the site of a ruined mansion: while the linked creature-a ghost- dwells in the attic where it was murdered, a downstairs bedroom might manifest a bleeding walls haunt to emphasize the scene of a tragic loss pertinent to the ghost's history; a demanding dead haunt (see page 230) might cause a trespasser to dig up a shallow grave in the garden where the ghost's corpse is buried; and the murder weapon might roam the halls of the mansion, manifesting as a malignant weapon haunt (see page 231).</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Clarifying Haunts</h1><p>Adjudicating the mind-affecting, fear-based effects of a haunt's primary attack can be problematic for characters outside the haunt's range or those immune to such effects. This can deprive some PCs of the ability to witness the haunt's story elements and thus assist allies plagued by a haunting presence. Fortunately, a haunt's secondary effects are less absolute. A haunt's secondary effect should reflect its primary effect in some manner, in ways all PCs can witness. For example, a spectral vermin haunt (see page 231) should still manifest a visible, ghostly phantom of a scurrying, skeletal rat swarm to those immune to the effect or beyond its range, even though the haunt's primary effect does not affect those PCs. This enables PCs to not only witness the haunt's secondary effect so as to better interpret a haunt's clues, but also to more easily recognize when fellow PCs are afflicted and need assistance.</p><p>Haunts created using spells with non-instantaneous durations can also create problems. If the haunts do not have the persistent quality, it is unclear whether these spells continue with their normal durations after the haunt's surprise-round attack. To resolve this matter, consider creating haunts with durations as persistent haunts.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Seances and Spirit Communication</h1><p>Some PCs may wish to establish communication with haunts that have been neutralized (reduced to 0 hit points) but not yet destroyed. Regardless of the haunts' original powers or CRs, GMs may elect to have neutralized haunts revert to rapping spirits or possessing dead haunts during their reset periods. Likewise, GMs may elect for rejuvenating undead such as ghosts and poltergeists to assume one of these states during rejuvenation periods. While still potentially frightening or even malevolent, these haunts can potentially communicate by using a code (such as one rap for \"yes\" and two for \"no\") in response to called out words, numbers, and letters. Those in contact with a demanding dead haunt, on the other hand, typically whisper messages in darkened seance chambers, or scribble writing at the haunt's suggestion. In either case, such spirits are often unreliable, always cryptic, and never able to convey knowledge beyond what they knew in life.</p><p>Diplomacy, spells such as <i>calm spirit</i>*, and comforting environments such as darkened seance cabinets can all improve a spirit's attitude. Some characters attempting to communicate with haunts carry flat, lettered boards known as talking boards, cone-shaped spirit trumpets, or writing planchettes-small, wheeled boards that write with chalk or charcoal pencils. While these are mundane items with no inherent magic of their own, in the hands of those with properly established rapports, these tools increase the efficiency of messages received from haunts, doubling the rate of communication from two signals (raps, letters, etc.) per round to four signals per round.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter6runninganoccultgame\">^Running an Occult Game</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter7occultrewards\">Occult Rewards</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"0xQjICsyoQxgk5CG"}

Upon completion of the ritual, creatures of the chosen type or subtype cannot open, touch, or even magically manipulate the door by any means (with no save or spell resistance applicable). A dungeon door can have only one avoidance ward at a time.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Breach The Veil Of Dreams </b></p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>School </b>Conjuration (Creation); <b>Level </b>6</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>60 minutes</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S, M (incenses burned in a bowl filled with grave earth, a bottle of wormwood wine for each caster), F (an ornate silver and mithral key worth 5,000 gp), SC (up to the Intelligence modifier of the primary caster)</p><p><b>Skill Checks </b>Knowledge (arcana) DC 32, 3 successes; Knowledge (planes) DC 32, 3 successes</p><p><b>Range </b>touch</p><p><b>Duration </b>instantaneous; see text</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none; <b>SR </b>no</p><p><b>Backlash </b>The primary caster takes 2d6 points of damage and becomes exhausted.</p><p><b>Failure </b>An animate dream (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 </i>29) appears at the site of the ritual and attacks the casters. At the GM's discretion, the animate dream may have the advanced template, be accompanied by fellow animate dreams, or both.</p><h1>EFFECT</h1><p>This ritual must be cast at night on the Material Plane. The casters drink the wormwood wine and begin chanting the incantation as the incense burns. The casters mix the ashes with the grave earth and use the mixture to draw a threshold with a keyhole. They then insert the key into this door as the incantation is completed. Success indicates the casters pass through the portal and enter a random location on the Dimension of Dreams.</p><p>If the casters wish to return to the Material Plane from the Dimension of Dreams, each must succeed at a DC 35 concentration check to do so. This is a full-round action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. The DC of this check is reduced by 1 for every 2d6 points of damage the traveler willingly takes from psychic and physical trauma as part of the full-round action (this damage can't be reduced in any way). If successful, the caster is transported back to the site of the ritual's casting of the Material Plane. The casters can try again if they fail their concentration checks. A caster can use her character level + her Charisma modifier as her bonus on the concentration check if she isn't a spellcaster or if that value is higher than her usual concentration bonus.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Call Beyond The Veil </b></p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>School </b>Conjuration (Calling); <b>Level </b>6</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>60 minutes</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S, F (either an object once possessed by the spirit or entity called, or the name of the spirit or entity called), SC (up to 8)</p><p><b>Skill Checks </b>Diplomacy DC 31, 2 successes; Knowledge (religion) DC 33, 3 successes; Knowledge (planes) DC 33, 1 success</p><p><b>Range </b>primary caster</p><p><b>Effect </b>call on the spirit of a single deceased creature or a psychic entity</p><p><b>Duration </b>concentration of the primary caster</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates; <b>SR </b>no</p><p><b>Backlash </b>All casters become exhausted and gain 1 temporary negative level (DC = 16 + primary caster's Charisma bonus to remove after the first day).</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Failure </b>All casters gain 1 permanent negative level and are exhausted until that negative level is removed.</p><h1>EFFECT</h1><p>The primary caster attempts to compel the spirit of a specific individual or a psychic entity to manifest from its final rest or extraplanar location. Unwilling spirits or entities can resist the summons by succeeding at a Will save. If a spirit or entity succeeds at the saving throw, it doesn't manifest, but the ritual is still considered a success. Spirits or entities that fail or forgo this save are summoned into the primary caster's body, where they speak by way of the caster's voice, which takes on an otherworldly timbre. Though the spirit or entity speaks through</p><p>the primary caster, it has no further control of that caster's mind or body, and can't use any spells, spell-like abilities, or even purely mental supernatural abilities it may have. It must leave the primary caster when that caster ends his concentration. While the spirit is speaking through the primary caster, the secondary casters can ask it questions at a maximum rate of 1 question per round (regardless of the number of secondary casters). The spirit or entity speaks in a language it knows or knew while it was alive, and can refuse to answer questions or attempt to deceive its questioners and the primary caster using Bluff. It is not otherwise beholden to the ritual casters.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Ensnaring Circle </b></p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>School </b>Abjuration [Variable; See Text]; <b>Level </b>4</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>40 minutes</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S, M (powdered silver), F (a stylus made of mithral and diamond worth 5,000 gp), SC (up to 8)</p><p><b>Skill Checks </b>Knowledge (planes) DC 30, 2 successes; Knowledge (religion) DC 30, 1 success; Linguistics DC 30, 1 success</p><p><b>Range </b>10 ft.</p><p><b>Effect </b>a 20-foot-radius magic circle</p><p><b>Duration </b>1 day/character level of the primary caster</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates (harmless); <b>SR </b>no, see text</p><p><b>Backlash </b>The primary caster takes 2d6 points of damage.</p><p><b>Failure </b>The casters believe their work was successful, though when they attempt to use the circle, nothing occurs.</p><h1>EFFECT</h1><p>This ritual requires the casters to create a large magic circle outlined with the silver powder and shaped with the focus stylus. The circle must be painstakingly molded to attune it to the alignment targeted (chaos, evil, good, or law), which is chosen during the time of creation. The ritual gains the descriptor of the alignment selected. Once the circle is complete, it becomes invisible to all but the casters of the ritual or to creatures with <i>see invisibility</i>, <i>true seeing</i>, or some other method of seeing invisible objects.</p><p>Once the circle is complete, it can be used to trap an outsider whose subtype matches the chosen alignment, as if it were an inward-focused magic circle spell of the appropriate type (thus, an ensnaring circle attuned to evil acts like an inward-focused <i>magic circle against evil</i>). For an outsider to be trapped in this manner, the entire space of the outsider must be within the circle, at which point the primary caster can activate the circle as an immediate action. The primary caster must be within 100 feet of the circle and be able to see it and the outsider he wishes to trap in order to activate the circle. It is possible to trap multiple outsiders of the appropriate subtype in the circle if more than one are in the circle when it is activated. However, if any such outsider is not completely within the circle, it is not caught within the circle's confines and is free to disrupt the circle as described in the <i>magic circle against evil </i>spell description.</p><p>As with a magic circle, the trapped outsider cannot cross the circle's boundaries or reach over or beyond the boundaries, nor can it disrupt the circle either directly or indirectly, though it can make ranged attacks beyond the circle's boundaries. If the outsider has spell resistance, it can test the trap once per day. If the primary caster fails to overcome the outsider's spell resistance, the circle is disrupted and the outsider is freed from the circle's restraints. An outsider capable of any form of dimensional travel can simply leave the circle using such an ability.</p><p>Unlike with a magic circle, you cannot create a special diagram when creating the circle to make the ensnaring circle more secure.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Ethereal Rip </b></p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>School </b>Evocation; <b>Level </b>5</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>50 minutes</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S, M (a dollop of ectoplasm and paste extracted from ground lotus root worth 500 gp), F (an obsidian dagger with at least a +2 enhancement bonus and the <i>ghost touch </i>special weapon ability, worth at least 18,301 gp)</p><p><b>Skill Checks </b>Knowledge (planes) DC 29, 3 successes; Knowledge (geography) DC 29, 2 successes</p><p><b>Range </b>touch</p><p><b>Effect </b>a rip between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane</p><p><b>Duration </b>1 hour/primary caster's character level and instantaneous; see text</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Reflex negates; <b>SR </b>no</p><p><b>Backlash </b>The caster takes 4d6 points of damage.</p><p><b>Failure </b>The caster gains the incorporeal subtype and is confused for 24 hours.</p><h1>EFFECT</h1><p>Upon this ritual's completion, the focus dagger is imbued with the power to cut a momentary rift between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane, though only if the caster adheres to the restrictions of the ritual.</p><p>At the ritual's start, the caster must find the perfect spot for such an incision: a place where the features of the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane are closely aligned (the exact spot is determined by the GM). Then, after mumbling an incantation that weakens the borders of those two planes at that location, the caster must evenly coat the entire focus blade with a mixture of the material components. When that is compete, the ritual is successful and the backlash occurs, but the ritual's true effect can be delayed. As long as the caster does not move from her space, and does not stop holding the focus dagger, she can use the dagger to cut into the weakened border between the two planes as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, but she must do so within 1 hour per character level after successfully completing the ritual and taking the backlash. Doing so has an immediate and dramatic effect-the rip attempts to suck all creatures and unattended objects within 30 feet of the caster's space that weigh less than 200 pounds into either the Ethereal Plane (if the rip is made on the Material Plane) or the Material Plane (if the rip is made on the Ethereal Plane). With a successful Reflex save, a creature avoids the rip's pull. Creatures and objects pulled into the rift land in a corresponding space on the other plane. The ritual caster can choose whether she wants to be sucked through the rift or stay on the plane where she cast the ritual.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Haunted Communion </b></p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>School </b>Necromancy; <b>Level </b>7</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>70 minutes</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S, M (special paints and a small, salted pastry), F (silver bell worth 500 gp), SC (up to 18)</p><p><b>Skill Checks </b>Knowledge (arcana) DC 31, 3 successes; Knowledge (religion) DC 31, 3 successes, Linguistics DC 31, 1 success</p><p><b>Range </b>touch</p><p><b>Target </b>one haunt within 60 feet</p><p><b>Duration </b>1 hour and 10 rounds (D); see text</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates; <b>SR </b>yes</p><p><b>Backlash </b>The primary caster is exhausted.</p><p><b>Failure </b>The casters take 1 permanent negative level and a -4 penalty on all skill and ability checks for as long as the negative level persists.</p><h1>EFFECT</h1><p>This ritual must be performed within 60 feet of a haunt. The primary caster rings the silver bell using an object associated with the haunt's origin or source of power. Once this is done, the primary caster draws an intricate circle adorned with occult symbols around a plate bearing the small, salted pastry.</p><p>If the incantation is successful, the haunt's spirit enters into the pastry (making the haunt inert for the duration of the ritual) and one of the casters must eat the pastry before the next hour or the ritual ends. Failure to do so allows the haunt to go free and increases any DCs of the haunt's effects by 4 and grants a +4 bonus on attack rolls made by the haunt for 24 hours. Once a caster eats the pastry, the spirit of the haunt speaks through the individual who ate the pastry, and is required to truthfully answer 10 questions (1 question per round) before departing, though since the haunt is an emotional echo, the answers may be brief, cryptic, or repetitive, as with <i>speak with dead</i>. Once the 10 questions are answered or the spell is dismissed, the haunt can manifest as normal.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Opening The Third Eye </b></p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>School </b>Transmutation; <b>Level </b>5</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>50 minutes</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S, M (incense), SC (up to 12)</p><p><b>Skill Checks </b>Knowledge (arcana) DC 34, 3 successes; Knowledge (planes) DC 34, 1 success; Perception DC 34, 1 success</p><p><b>Range </b>touch</p><p><b>Target </b>primary and secondary casters</p><p><b>Duration </b>1 day (D)</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Fortitude negates (harmless); <b>SR </b>yes (harmless)</p><p><b>Backlash </b>All casters take 2d6 points of damage.</p><p><b>Failure </b>All casters gain a temporary negative level (DC = 16 + primary caster's Charisma bonus to remove after the first day), and the primary caster is afflicted with a more potent version of the mindfire disease (DC 17; 2 saves; 1d4 Int; 1/day).</p><h1>EFFECT</h1><p>Through a ceremony of meditation and recitation, the casters of this ritual become psychically attuned.

As the ritual concludes, the caster blows out a lantern using the diamond dust, leaving her and the target in the darkened room. While in the darkness, the caster must touch the ritual's target before exiting the room. Then, for a number of days equal to the caster's character level, the target gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against psychic spells and abilities, but can't use any psychic magic abilities, can't cast psychic spells or use psychic magic, and can't be engaged or engage in a psychic duel.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Ritual Exorcism </b></p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>School </b>Abjuration; <b>Level </b>4</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>40 minutes</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S, M (vial of holy water), F (silver holy symbol), SC (up to 12)</p><p><b>Skill Checks </b>Knowledge (religion) DC 28, 2 successes; Spellcraft DC 28, 2 successes</p><p><b>Range </b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./character level of the primary caster)</p><p><b>Target </b>one helpless possessed creature or a restrained possessed object</p><p><b>Duration </b>instantaneous</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates; <b>SR </b>yes</p><p><b>Backlash </b>All casters become exhausted.</p><p><b>Failure </b>All casters gain 1 temporary negative level (DC = 16 + primary caster's Charisma bonus to remove after the first day), and the primary caster takes 4d6 points of damage.</p><h1>EFFECT</h1><p>You force the life force of a possessing creature to leave its host.

The ritual must be performed at the top of a hill, mountain, or other natural vantage point. The primary caster is first wrapped in the focus chains, and the candles are lit in the pattern of the stars in conjunction. The primary caster must sit in complete silence, concentrating on the light of the candles, while the secondary casters circle, chanting the occult incantation. If the ritual is successfully completed, the primary caster's mind is allowed to wander the Astral Plane unhindered, and she can ask one question each hour her mind wanders. The spirits of the Astral Plane answer the caster truthfully, though there is usually only a 60% chance that they will have the answer the primary caster seeks (the chance may be higher or lower at the GM's discretion, depending on the nature of the information sought). If they don't have the answer, the spirits admit that they lack the knowledge the caster seeks rather than trying to deceive her.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Veil Structure </b></p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>School </b>Illusion (Glamer); <b>Level </b>8</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>80 minutes</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S, M (a half-gallon of water from a fresh spring and a <i>potion of invisibility</i>), f(a pair of mithral pitchers and two golden aspergillums, worth 25,000 gp total), SC (at least 4 and up to 12)</p><p><b>Skill Checks </b>Knowledge (nature or local; see below) DC 32, 4 successes; Spellcraft DC 32, 2 successes; Sleight of Hand DC 32, 2 successes</p><p><b>Range </b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./character level of the primary caster)</p><p><b>Area </b>one 20-ft. cube/character level of primary caster</p><p><b>Duration </b>permanent (D)</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will disbelief (if interacted with); <b>SR </b>no</p><p><b>Backlash </b>The primary caster takes 1 permanent negative level.</p><p><b>Failure </b>All casters cannot be targeted by any beneficial glamer effects (such as <i>invisibility</i>) for 1 year (this is a curse effect, and can be removed with <i>remove curse </i>and similar effects).</p><h1>EFFECT</h1><p>The primary caster starts this ritual by placing the fresh spring water in one of the mithral pitchers and the <i>potion of invisibility </i>within the other. The caster then mixes the components of the two pitchers by pouring the water into the pitcher that holds the potion and then transferring the mixed contents back into the pitcher that initially held the water. She then repeats this transference between pitchers six more times, before handing one of the pitchers to one of the secondary casters. In complete silence, the primary caster and the chosen secondary caster use the aspergillums to splash the mixture on a building or structure they wish to veil, which must be no larger than the ritual's area. If the building or structure is in a natural environment, the casters must attempt Knowledge (nature) checks for the ritual. If the building or structure is in an urban environment, they must attempt Knowledge (local) checks.</p><p>Upon the successful completion of the ritual, the building is veiled, and it appears as if the area were devoid of anything but its natural or urban setting. All of the ritual casters are still able to see the faintest outline of the building and interact with it normally. The primary caster also gains the ability to grant up to 10 creatures per day that she touches the ability to see the faintest outline of the building for a 24-hour period.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter5occultrules\">^Occult Rules</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter6runninganoccultgame\">Running an Occult Game</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"2EVSfhmVLRrto2pb"}

           <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>CLASS FEATURES</h1><p>The following are the class features of the mesmerist.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword cane(UE), and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p><p><b>Spells</b>: A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list (see page 44). He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell's level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the mesmerist's Charisma modifier.</p><p>Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 on page 17 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>).</p><p>The mesmerist's selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist's choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist's spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn't affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1-5 are fixed.</p><p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p><p>A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.</p><p><b>Consummate Liar</b>: A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn't have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.</p><p><b>Hypnotic Stare (Su)</b>: A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a -2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to -3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target's mind; the creature doesn't remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist's focus than the target's perception of his stare. It can't be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist's focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists' stares don't stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches' evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p><p><b>Knacks</b>: Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p><p><b>Mesmerist Tricks (Su)</b>: A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).</p><p>To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick's description), even if it isn't his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick's triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn't need line of sight to trigger it-but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.</p><p>Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can't be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick's entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist's level + the mesmerist's Charisma modifier.</p><p>The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick's description, a mesmerist can't choose a particular trick more than once.</p><p><i>Astounding Avoidance</i>: The subject can avoid damage from magical and unusual attacks. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a saving throw against an attack or spell that normally deals half damage on a successful save, before the subject rolls the save. If the subject succeeds at her save, she takes no damage. If the mesmerist is 12th level or higher, the subject takes only half damage if she fails her save. The benefits of this trick don't stack with those of the evasion or stalwart class features.</p><p><i>Compel Alacrity</i>: A dash of mental speed lets the subject push past her physical limits to avoid an enemy. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject begins her turn within an enemy's reach. The subject can move 10 feet as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. The distance the subject can move increases by 5 feet for every 5 levels the mesmerist possesses, to a maximum of 30 feet at 20th level. The subject can't move farther than her speed in this way. The movement from this trick doesn't count against the subject's movement speed for that round.</p><p><i>False Flanker</i>: A duplicate of the mesmerist appears momentarily, as though he were fighting in tandem with the subject. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject moves into or begins her turn in a square where she threatens an enemy. An illusory duplicate of the mesmerist appears in any unoccupied space adjacent to that enemy. This duplicate counts as threatening the enemy for the purposes of determining flanking, but can't actually make attacks. The duplicate disappears at the end of the turn during which the trick is triggered. This is an illusion (figment) effect, and a creature that interacts with the false flanker can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect.</p><p><i>Fearsome Guise</i>: A veil of illusion makes the subject appear to be someone else and then transform into a hideous monster at an opportune time. While this trick is implanted, the subject's appearance is altered, as <i>disguise self</i>. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attacks a creature. The illusory appearance briefly makes the subject appear monstrous, then ends. The mesmerist attempts an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of the triggering attack. The restrictions on attempts to demoralize a target (the target being within 30 feet and able to see and hear the creature attempting the Intimidate check) apply to the subject of the trick. This is an illusion (glamer) effect.</p><p><i>Gift of Will</i>: A small portion of the mesmerist's vast mental power buttresses his ally's mind. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a Will saving throw or a Sense Motive check, or is targeted by an Intimidate check to demoralize her. For a saving throw, the subject uses the mesmerist's Will saving throw bonus instead of her own. For a Sense Motive check or Intimidate check, she adds the mesmerist's Charisma bonus as a morale bonus on the check or to the DC. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><i>Levitation Buffer</i>: A mesmerist's telekinetic assault renders foes around the subject less of a threat. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when either an enemy moves adjacent to the subject or the subject begins her turn with one or more enemies adjacent to her. The mesmerist can either lift all enemies adjacent to the subject slightly into the air or push them all away from the subject. Lifting enemies causes them to move at half speed and take a -4 penalty to their CMDs against bull rush, drag, and reposition attempts for 1 round (Will negates). The speed reduction and CMD penalty don't stack with those from <i>hostile levitation </i>(<i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat </i>231). Pushing enemies away requires the mesmerist to attempt a bull rush combat maneuver check using his mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier as his CMB. Any enemy that's successfully pushed moves away from the subject of the trick using the normal rules for a bull rush.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><i>Linked Reaction</i>: A hive mind allows the mesmerist and an ally to share one another's reaction times. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when either the subject or the mesmerist is surprised and the other isn't (even if the mesmerist would normally be unable to take actions because of being surprised). Both the mesmerist and the subject can act in this surprise round. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself.</p><p><i>Mask Misery</i>: The subject can shrug off a condition for a short time before succumbing to it. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject becomes affected by a minor condition listed under the touch treatment ability. The subject can ignore the effect of that condition for 1d4 rounds, after which the subject takes the full effect. This has no effect on any conditions affecting the subject other than the triggering condition, even if those other effects are also listed under touch treatment. The rounds during which the subject ignores the triggering effect still count against that effect's duration; if the duration of mask misery is longer than the effect lasts, the subject isn't affected by the condition at all. If an effect that imposes more than one condition triggers this trick, the subject ignores all eligible conditions. If the mesmerist is 6th level or higher, he adds the moderate conditions to the conditions he can ignore with this trick, and this trick ends minor conditions entirely instead of suppressing them temporarily. The mesmerist doesn't need to have touch treatment to choose or use this trick.</p><p><i>Meek Facade</i>: The subject magically seems like a weak target, goading an enemy into attacking her. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject misses a creature with an attack (even if it's part of a full attack in which she hits that creature with another attack). The enemy must attack no one other than the subject, and the subject gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC against the triggering enemy's attacks. Both of these effects last for 1 round. The bonus to AC increases by 1 for every 5 levels the mesmerist possesses. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.</p><p><i>Mesmeric Mirror</i>: An illusory image appears near the subject to throw off attackers. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is attacked or becomes the target of a spell that requires an attack roll. One duplicate of the subject appears, and the attacker must determine randomly which it hits (as <i>mirror image</i>). For every 5 class levels the mesmerist possesses, one additional image appears, to a maximum of five images at 20th level. Each image lasts for 1 minute per mesmerist level or until destroyed. This is an illusion (figment) effect.</p><p><i>Mesmeric Pantomime</i>: By orchestrating the movement of his ally's body, the mesmerist imparts to that ally his own skill at a physical task. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a Strength- or Dexterity-based skill check. The subject either uses the mesmerist's bonus on the skill check in place of her own or gains a morale bonus on the check equal to the mesmerist's Charisma bonus, whichever results in a higher modifier. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself.</p><p><i>Misdirection</i>: An enemy's perception of an attack by the subject shifts, making the foe unprepared to defend against the attack. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject makes an attack or uses a spell that requires an attack roll. The mesmerist attempts a Bluff check to feint against a single target of the subject's attack. Unlike a normal feint, this ability can be used on non-melee attacks. If the feint succeeds, the target of the attack is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against the triggering attack. The target doesn't suffer any additional effects that the mesmerist or the subject would cause on a normal feint or Bluff check. This is an illusion (glamer) effect.</p><p><i>Psychosomatic Surge</i>: Psychic magic soothes the subject, alleviating her wounds temporarily. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage. The subject gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + 1/2 the mesmerist's level. If the damage from the triggering attack would have reduced the subject to 0 hit points or fewer, this trick grants an additional 1d8 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour or until discharged.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><i>Reflection of Weakness</i>: Psychic feedback causes an enemy to suffer from the same weakening effect it imposes on the subject. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when an attack or spell used by an enemy causes the subject to take ability damage, ability drain, bleed damage, or a minor or moderate condition listed under the touch treatment class feature. If the trick is triggered by ability damage, ability drain, or bleed damage, the amount of damage or drain the subject takes is reduced by 2 points (to a minimum of 0 points), and the creature that made the attack or cast the spell takes 2 points of ability damage to an ability score of the mesmerist's choice. The monster can attempt a Will save to negate the ability damage. This ability can be used if the attacker inflicts a curse, disease, or poison that deals ability damage or drain, but only if it deals that damage immediately, with no onset time.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>If the trick is triggered by the subject gaining a condition, the subject is still affected by the condition, but the attacker takes a condition of the mesmerist's choice for 1 round. This condition must come from the minor condition or moderate condition lists of the touch treatment class feature. The enemy can attempt a Will save to avoid gaining the condition. The mesmerist doesn't need to have touch treatment to select or use this trick.</p><p><i>Shadow Splinter</i>: The mesmerist protects the subject against an attack and redirects the harm to someone else. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage from an attack. The damage the subject takes is reduced by an amount equal to 3 + the mesmerist's Charisma modifier (to a maximum of the total amount of damage the attack deals). Another creature within range of the original attack, other than the attacker, is affected by a shadow illusion that makes it appear as if the attacker is attacking that creature instead of the attacker's actual target. This second creature takes an amount of damage equal to the amount by which the attack's damage was reduced. This shadow doesn't require a roll to hit and ignores cover and concealment, but the target can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect. If it succeeds at this save, it neither takes the damage nor believes the attacker targeted it. This trick can't be triggered if there's no eligible second creature within range to take the redirected damage. This is an illusion (shadow) effect.</p><p><i>Spectral Smoke</i>: A cloud of smoke pops up around the subject, foiling attacks. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by an attack or by a spell that requires an attack roll. A smoke cloud appears in the subject's square and in a 10-foot radius around it. This cloud lasts for 1 round per mesmerist level. The cloud functions as <i>fog cloud</i>, but is an illusion (figment) effect that can't be dispersed by wind and can be used underwater. A creature that interacts with the cloud can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect. The radius of the cloud increases by 5 feet for every 5 caster levels the mesmerist possesses, to a maximum of 30 feet at 20th level.</p><p><i>Vanish Arrow</i>: With a flourish, the mesmerist snatches a projectile from an enemy before it can be shot. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by a ranged weapon attack, before the attack roll is made. The mesmerist attempts a Sleight of Hand check opposed by the attacker's Perception check. If the mesmerist succeeds, that ranged attack automatically misses, and the projectile appears stowed on the mesmerist's person. If the attacker is making a full attack, this affects only one of the attacks (of the mesmerist's choice). If the attack is made with a javelin or other thrown weapon, the attacker gains a +4 bonus on its Perception check. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as boulders or ballista bolts) and ranged attacks generated by natural attacks or spell effects are not affected by this ability.</p><p><b>Painful Stare (Su)</b>: When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist's hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist's class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn't his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists' painful stares in a round.</p><p><b>Towering Ego (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws.</p><p><b>Bold Stare (Su)</b>: At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist's hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can't be changed later. The mesmerist can't choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist's bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist's hypnotic stare.</p><p><i>Allure</i>: The hypnotic stare penalty also applies on initiative checks and Perception checks.</p><p><i>Disorientation</i>: The hypnotic stare penalty also applies on attack rolls.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><i>Psychic Inception</i>: The hypnotic stare and its penalty can affect creatures that are mindless or immune to mind-affecting effects (such as an undead or vermin). The mesmerist can also partially affect such a creature with his mind-affecting spells and abilities if it's under the effect of his hypnotic stare; it gains a +2 bonus on its saving throw (if any), and if affected, it still has a 50% chance each round of ignoring the effect. Ignoring the effect doesn't end the effect, but does allow the creature to act normally for that round.</p><p><i>Sapped Magic</i>: The hypnotic stare penalty also applies to the DCs of spells and spell-like abilities used by the target, and to the target's spell resistance (if any).</p><p><i>Sluggishness</i>: The target of the hypnotic stare has all of its speeds reduced by 5 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet), and the hypnotic stare penalty also applies to the target's Reflex saving throws.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><i>Susceptibility</i>: The hypnotic stare penalty also applies to the target's Sense Motive checks to oppose Bluff checks, and to the DCs of Diplomacy and Intimidate checks made against the target.</p><p><i>Timidity</i>: The hypnotic stare penalty also applies to damage rolls.</p><p><b>Touch Treatment (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions-especially those that affect their minds-by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list.</p><p><i>Minor Conditions</i>: Fascinated, shaken.</p><p><i>Moderate Conditions</i>: Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened.</p><p><i>Greater Conditions</i>: Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned.</p><p>A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of <i>break enchantment</i>. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.</p><p><b>Manifold Tricks (Su)</b>: At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist's tricks).</p><p><b>Mental Potency (Ex)</b>: At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5th-level mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with <i>sleep</i>, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with <i>hypnotism</i>, and change the categories for <i>color spray </i>to \"3 HD or fewer,\" \"4 or 5 HD,\" and \"6 or more HD.\" The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.</p><p><b>Glib Lie (Su)</b>: At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truth-detecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist's class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a <i>glibness </i>spell); failure means the magic doesn't detect the mesmerist's lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the <i>glibness </i>spell's bonus on Bluff checks.</p><p><b>Masterful Tricks (Su)</b>: At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.</p><p><i>Avian Escape</i>: The subject changes shape to elude an attacking enemy. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage from an enemy's attack. The subject transforms into a bird (as <i>beast shape III</i>). Though the subject can appear as any Tiny bird, it uses the statistics for a raven (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>133). This is a polymorph effect.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><i>Cursed Sanction</i>: A ward curses an enemy who attacks the subject. While this trick is implanted, a visible, circular symbol appears on the subject's forehead. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is attacked or becomes the target of a spell that requires an attack roll. The attacker takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks for 1 minute per mesmerist level (Will negates). This penalty applies to the triggering attack roll. This is a curse effect.</p><p><i>Faked Death</i>: The subject appears to die, but actually can stealthily move about. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is damaged by an attack. The subject seems to fall down dead (as <i>programmed image</i>), but actually turns invisible (as <i>invisibility</i>) for a number of rounds equal to the mesmerist's level or until she attacks.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Once the subject becomes visible again, the illusory dead body disappears. These are illusion effects, and a creature that interacts with the false body can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect. The false body is a figment; the invisibility is a glamer.</p><p><i>Free in Body</i>: When constrained, the subject can easily slip loose. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject begins its turn grappled or under an effect that impedes its movement (including paralysis, <i>solid fog</i>, <i>slow</i>, and <i>web</i>). The subject gains the benefits of <i>freedom of movement </i>for 1 minute.</p><p><i>Greater Mask Misery</i>: This trick functions as the mask misery trick, but can be used to ignore greater conditions as well. A mesmerist must have the mask misery mesmerist trick to take greater mask misery.</p><p><i>Mental Fallback</i>: Mental commands placed deep in the subject's mind trigger when she would fall under mind control, allowing the mesmerist to control her instead. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is affected by a charm or compulsion effect created by an enemy. The subject acts as though the mesmerist had cast the spell instead of the enemy. For instance, if the subject were affected by <i>charm monster </i>cast by an enemy, that enemy can't try to give her orders, but the mesmerist could. If the charm or compulsion causes penalties or conditions (such as those imposed by <i>confusion</i>, <i>crushing despair</i>, or <i>hold person</i>), the subject can ignore any of those penalties or conditions the mesmerist chooses. This trick overrides the charm or compulsion for a number of rounds equal to the mesmerist's level or until the duration of the triggering effect elapses, whichever comes first. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself.</p><p><i>Spatial Switch</i>: The mesmerist allows himself and an ally to physically swap places. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when an enemy moves adjacent to or attacks either the subject or the mesmerist, provided the subject and the mesmerist are within 100 feet of one another. The subject and the mesmerist then swap positions. If this trick was triggered by an attack, the swap happens before checking to see whether the attack hits. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself. This is a conjuration (teleportation) effect.</p><p><i>Spell Anticipation</i>: The mesmerist can choose a spell to strike back at enemy spellcasters. When the mesmerist implants this trick, he must expend one spell slot to couple a spell he knows of that level with the trick. That spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less and be able to target one creature (spells like <i>dominate person </i>that have more restrictive targeting can be used, but have no effect if triggered against creatures that don't match). He can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by an enemy's spell. The mesmerist's spell then triggers, affecting only the enemy spellcaster. This takes effect only if the enemy spellcaster is within range of the spell (as measured from the subject of the trick), and functions as though the mesmerist were in the subject's square. The enemy's spell still has its full effect, even if the mesmerist's spell would normally protect against it or make the caster unable to cast it.</p><p><i>Vision of Blood</i>: When an enemy is struck by the subject, it believes its wound is far more severe, and the shock overwhelms it. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject hits with an attack using a weapon, a natural weapon, or an unarmed strike. The attack's target must succeed at a Will saving throw or be stunned for 1 round. If the triggering attack was a critical hit, the target doesn't get a saving throw.</p><p><b>Rule Minds (Su)</b>: At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell's DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn't a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as <i>dominate monster</i>) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can't be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1occultclasses\">^Occult Classes</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypes\">Archetypes</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"3Q6ZBcdellSswWeN"}

You can throw a flask of ectoplasmic residue as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit deals no damage, but the target must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be shaken for 1 round.

Followers of a discipline might come to it in a variety of different ways, and though some might join together in orders, others follow personal, singular interpretations of the discipline. Spells with an asterisk (*) appear in Chapter 4 of this book.</p><h1>Abomination</h1><p>Your mind is impure, tainted by outside forces. These might be monstrous ancestors whose blood still flows within you, or powerful and unknowable psychic forces that intrude upon your mind. Like a psychic disease, this influence consumes part of your brain, creating a dark counterpart to your normal self. Every time you call forth a psychic spell, you're drawing on this dangerous force-and potentially giving it a greater hold on you. This malign influence might stem from creatures like rakshasas and aboleths, or perhaps malign entities that dwell in the voids between the stars.</p><p><b>Phrenic Pool Ability</b>: Charisma.</p><p><b>Bonus Spells</b>: <i>Ray of enfeeblement </i>(1st), <i>alter self </i>(4th), <i>excruciating deformation</i>(UM) (6th), <i>black tentacles </i>(8th), <i>explode head</i>* (10th), <i>repulsion </i>(12th), <i>insanity </i>(14th), <i>orb of the void</i>(UM) (16th), <i>telekinetic storm</i>* (18th).</p><p><b>Discipline Powers</b>: Your powers allow the dark influences to take over, and it can be difficult to come back from the brink.</p><p><i>Dark Half (Su)</i>: By allowing the dark forces to overcome you, you can enter a state of instinctual cruelty as a swift action. While you're manifesting your dark half, you increase the DCs of your psychic spells by 1, gain a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, and become immune to fear effects. Whenever you cast a spell that deals damage while manifesting your dark half, you can cause one creature that took damage from the spell to also take 1 point of bleed damage. The amount of bleed damage increases to 2 points at 5th level and to 1d6 points at 13th level. While manifesting your dark half, you can't use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration other than casting spells using psychic magic, using phrenic amplifications, or attempting to return to normal. You can attempt to return to your normal self as a free action, but must succeed at a concentration check with a DC equal to 10 + your caster level. If you fail, you continue to manifest your dark half and can't attempt to change back for 1 round. You can manifest your dark half for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + 1/2 your psychic level + your Charisma modifier; when these rounds are expended, you return to your normal self without requiring a concentration check.</p><p><i>Morphic Form (Ex)</i>: At 5th level, while manifesting your dark half, you gain DR 5. This damage reduction can be overcome by a random type of damage each time you manifest your dark half, determined by rolling on the table below.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td colspan=\"3\"><b>d%</b></td><td colspan=\"10\"><b>Damage Reduction</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">1-35</td><td colspan=\"10\">DR 5/bludgeoning</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">36-60</td><td colspan=\"10\">DR 5/cold iron</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">61-100</td><td colspan=\"10\">DR 5/magic</td></tr></table><p>@RollTable[bFROn9iZNA9fU7v9](rollable)</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><i>Psychic Safeguard (Su)</i>: At 13th level, you project constant mental defenses, gaining spell resistance equal to 8 + your caster level. While manifesting your dark half, this spell resistance increases to 16 + your caster level.</p><h1>Dream</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>You discover deeper and more powerful corners of your mind through journeys you make in your dreams. Your consciousness expands outward into other dreaming minds, allowing you to explore the psychic landscapes of unconsciousness or regions of nightmare and horror.</p><p><b>Phrenic Pool Ability</b>: Charisma.</p><p><b>Bonus Spells</b>: <i>Sleep </i>(1st), <i>oneiric horror</i>* (4th), <i>deep slumber </i>(6th), <i>sleepwalk</i>(APG) (8th), <i>nightmare </i>(10th), <i>cloak of dreams</i>(APG) (12th), <i>ethereal jaunt </i>(14th), <i>dream voyage</i>* (16th), <i>microcosm</i>* (18th).</p><p><b>Discipline Powers</b>: Your mind can powerfully influence dreaming consciousnesses.</p><p><i>Dream Leech (Su)</i>: While adjacent to a sleeping or unconscious creature, you can take a swift action to siphon that creature's dreams, thereby learning new things about your own mind.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>The creature can attempt a Will save to negate this effect; such creatures are never considered willing. Creatures that don't dream are immune to this effect. If the subject fails the save, you gain a +4 bonus on your next Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check against the subject within the next 24 hours, and you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier, but no more than once per hour and no more than once per creature per day.</p><p><i>Oneiromancy (Su)</i>: As a standard action, you can tamper with the minds of sleeping creatures. You plant a subconscious thought in a sleeping creature's mind by attempting a Diplomacy or Intimidate check to modify the sleeping creature's attitude or request a service from it. If you succeed, when the creature wakes it behaves in the way you dictated with the normal restrictions for the Diplomacy or Intimidate skill. The target of oneiromancy remains unaware of this manipulation, though if you fail your Diplomacy check the subject might have its starting attitude toward you negatively impacted, as normal. You must be adjacent to the sleeping creature to use this ability. Alternatively, you can use this ability as part of the casting of <i>dream, minor dream</i>(ARG),<i> </i>or <i>nightmare. </i>In this case, the oneiromancy effect takes place when the spell is cast. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. Creatures that don't dream are immune to this effect.</p><p><i>Mind Heist (Sp)</i>: At 5th level, you can delve into the subconscious mind of a sleeping target. You can cast <i>detect thoughts </i>as a spell-like ability on any adjacent sleeping creature. Additionally, you can gain the benefit of <i>detect thoughts </i>on a target of your <i>dream, minor dream</i>(ARG),<i> </i>or <i>nightmare </i>spells as if you had studied the target for 3 rounds. If you cast <i>dream scan </i>(see page 166), you know whether you received false information from the dream. A successful Will save negates mind heist. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.</p><p><i>Waking Dream (Sp)</i>: At 13th level, as a standard action, you can take control of the body of a sleeping creature within 30 feet for 1 hour per level. This ability functions like <i>magic jar</i>, except that your soul travels directly into the sleeping target with no receptacle necessary and the target creature's consciousness remains dreaming and unaware of its body's actions. When waking dream ends or the host body is destroyed, you immediately wake up in your body regardless of the distance from the host body, provided your body hasn't been destroyed. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus. Creatures that don't dream are immune to this effect.</p><h1>Faith</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Your belief in a higher power fuels your psychic abilities. Whether your mental abilities truly come to you as a divine gift or are simply enhanced by the power of your belief, none can say. In many ways, you resemble a divine caster, and prayers often factor into your casting of psychic spells.</p><p><b>Phrenic Pool Ability</b>: Wisdom.</p><p><b>Bonus Spells</b>: <i>Bless </i>(1st), <i>spiritual weapon </i>(4th), <i>magic vestment </i>(6th), <i>guardian of faith</i>(ACG) (8th), <i>commune </i>(10th), <i>psychic surgery</i>* (12th), <i>greater scrying </i>(14th), <i>greater planar ally </i>(16th), <i>miracle </i>(18th).</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Discipline Powers</b>: Your powers serve to protect or cure you and your allies.</p><p><i>Deity (Ex)</i>: At 1st level, choose a deity to worship. Your alignment must remain within one step of your deity's or you lose access to all this discipline's bonus spells and discipline powers.</p><p><i>Divine Energy</i>: You can channel spell energy into cure or inflict spells. This ability functions similarly to the cleric's ability to spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells, and the type of spells you can convert depends on your alignment in the same way. The cure or inflict spells don't count as being on your psychic spell list for the purposes of any other effects. Each day, you can convert up to one spell from each spell level you can cast. Each time you use this ability to convert a spell, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. The maximum number of points you can regain in this way per day is equal to your Wisdom modifier.</p><p><i>Resilience of the Faithful (Su)</i>: At 5th level, you gain a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 levels you possess beyond 5th.</p><p><i>Prayer Aura (Su)</i>: At 13th level, as a free action, you can extend an aura around you to bolster your allies and make your enemies less effective. You can use this aura for a number of rounds per day equal to your psychic level. These rounds don't need to be consecutive. This functions as the <i>prayer </i>spell, granting your allies a +1 luck bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saves, and skill checks and imposing a -1 penalty on your enemies' rolls of those types. If you are chaotic, lawful, good, or evil, the penalty from your aura changes to -2 against creatures of an opposing alignment. The penalty doesn't change further for a creature that opposes you on two alignment axes (such as a chaotic evil creature fighting a lawful good psychic).</p><h1>Lore</h1><p>By collecting expert information and reading all sorts of treatises and chapbooks on occult subjects, you learn proper techniques and rituals to empower your mental abilities. Your abilities become stronger through study and science, not instinct.</p><p><b>Phrenic Pool Ability</b>: Wisdom.</p><p><b>Bonus Spells</b>: <i>Comprehend languages </i>(1st), <i>hypercognition</i>* (4th), <i>dispel magic </i>(6th), <i>mind probe</i>* (8th), <i>retrocognition</i>* (10th), <i>legend lore </i>(12th), <i>greater arcane sight </i>(14th), <i>moment of prescience </i>(16th), <i>divide mind</i>* (18th).</p><p><b>Discipline Powers</b>: Your powers relate to your extensive knowledge and your ability to alter and adapt your memory.</p><p><i>Illuminating Answers (Su)</i>: You can glean deeper truths from advice you magically obtain, even if the information itself is specious. When you use a spell or spell-like ability that allows you to get answers to questions (such as <i>augury</i>, <i>blood biography</i>(APG), or <i>contact other plane</i>) and get at least one answer, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. You regain this point even if the answer is false or vague. The maximum number of points you can regain in this way per day is equal to your Wisdom modifier.</p><p><i>Mnemonic Cache (Su)</i>: You can memorize a piece of information and later recall it perfectly. Your mnemonic cache can hold roughly 10 pages of written information, including images and maps, or 30 minutes' worth of speech or music. (Memorizing music doesn't confer the ability to perform it properly.) The amount you can store increases by 5 pages and 5 minutes at 2nd level, and at every psychic level thereafter. You can hold only one piece of information in your mnemonic cache at a time. The information doesn't go away when you recall it, but when you put a new piece of information in the cache, the old piece becomes as imperfect any other memory. Memorizing magical writing (such as a scroll or a page from a spellbook) doesn't confer the ability to borrow, duplicate, or retain any of the magic in the writing. You could reproduce the spell in writing to allow someone who prepares spells from a spellbook to prepare it, though this functions as using a borrowed spellbook for anyone other than you. If you're in telepathic contact with another creature (through <i>telepathic bond</i>, for example), you can transfer the information directly into its mind as a free action. For this creature, the information functions like a normal memory, not one with perfect clarity.</p><p>You can attempt to sequester a written magical trap (such as <i>explosive runes </i>or <i>sepia snake sigil</i>) in your mnemonic cache and destroy it. Treat this as a Disable Device check to disarm a magical trap (as though you had the trapfinding class feature). Your bonus on this roll is equal to either your Disable Device modifier or the sum of 5 + your psychic level + your Wisdom modifier, whichever is higher. If you succeed, instead of being disabled, the trap is erased and destroyed. This ability can't destroy symbol traps; it functions only if written text is involved.</p><p><i>Superior Automatic Writing (Ex)</i>: At 5th level, when attempting checks for the automatic writing occult skill unlock (see page 194), you can treat your psychic level + your Wisdom bonus as your number of Linguistics skill ranks. At 8th level, you gain an additional option when using automatic writing, and can attempt a DC 35 check to gain information as though you'd used <i>commune </i>instead of <i>augury </i>or <i>divination</i>. This type of <i>commune </i>requires no material component, and the duration equals 1 round per psychic class level you possess. You connect to a distant being of great intellect, a fragment of the Akashic Record (see page 244), or a similar bastion of knowledge instead of to a deity.</p><p><i>Memory Palace (Su)</i>: At 13th level, you mentally construct an extradimensional library to house mental constructs representing the volumes of lore you've studied. This ability functions as <i>mage's magnificent mansion</i>, with the following adjustments: the memory palace is limited in size to a number of 10-foot cubes equal to your psychic level; your memory palace doesn't contain any furniture other than bookcases and a few desks and sofas where you and your visitors can study; and there is no food within, though the memory palace does contain a number of <i>unseen servants </i>equal to 1/2 your psychic level, which function solely as librarians. The library keeps the same layout each time you summon it, though you can alter its appearance each time you gain a level or by spending 15 minutes concentrating. You can reshape the memory palace in your mind, so it doesn't need to currently be in effect for you to alter it. You can create your memory palace once per day.</p><p>Choose one type of Knowledge skill when you gain this ability. Consulting your memory palace gives anyone who studies within-including you-a +4 circumstance bonus on Knowledge checks of that type, and the memory palace counts as an extensive library for people attempting Knowledge checks of that type untrained. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on checks with the chosen skill when you're not consulting the palace (including when the palace isn't in effect). At 14th level and at each additional level thereafter, choose another Knowledge skill to which your memory palace's library bonuses apply.</p><h1>Pain</h1><p>Mental blocks prevent your immense inborn psychic energies from flowing freely. They are unleashed only when you suffer pain.</p><p><b>Phrenic Pool Ability</b>: Charisma.</p><p><b>Bonus Spells</b>: <i>Persuasive goad</i>(UM) (1st), <i>pain strike</i>(APG) (4th), <i>vampiric touch </i>(6th), <i>mass pain strike</i>(APG) (8th), <i>synapse overload</i>* (10th), <i>mass inflict pain</i>* (12th), <i>waves of exhaustion </i>(14th), <i>horrid wilting </i>(16th), <i>mass suffocation</i>(APG) (18th).</p><p><b>Discipline Powers</b>: Your powers allow you to cause and endure pain.</p><p><i>Painful Reminder (Su)</i>: As a swift action, you can cause an enemy to take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage if you dealt damage to that enemy with a spell since the start of your previous turn. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. This damage increases to 2d6 at 8th level and to 3d6 at 15th level.</p><p><i>Power from Pain (Su)</i>: If your painful reminder deals at least 5 points of damage, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. The maximum number of points you can regain in this way per day is equal to your Wisdom modifier.</p><p><i>Live On (Sp)</i>: At 5th level, you can use lay on hands as though you were a paladin of 3 levels lower than your psychic level. You also gain access to mercies as though you were a paladin of 3 levels lower than your psychic level. You can target only yourself with lay on hands or mercies gained from this discipline. This stacks with lay on hands abilities gained from other sources.</p><p><i>Agonizing Wound (Su)</i>: At 13th level, whenever you cast a spell that deals damage to a creature, you can also make that creature frightened or sickened (your choice) for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. If you expend two uses of this ability, you can instead have the creature become dazed, nauseated, or panicked for 1 round. The creature can attempt a Will saving throw to negate this effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. This is a mind-affecting pain(UM) effect.</p><h1>Psychedelia</h1><p>You ingest hallucinogens to expand your mind. Experimentation and study show you which ones will have the greatest effect. Your psychedelic forays put you into a different mental space from others, and normal people don't really understand you.</p><p><b>Phrenic Pool Ability</b>: Wisdom.</p><p><b>Bonus Spells</b>: <i>Polypurpose panacea</i>(UM) (1st), <i>mad hallucination</i>(UM) (4th), <i>synesthesia</i>* (6th), <i>confusion </i>(8th), <i>mirage arcana </i>(10th), <i>joyful rapture</i>(UM) (12th), <i>waves of ecstasy</i>(UM) (14th), <i>euphoric tranquility</i>(APG) (16th), <i>astral projection </i>(18th).</p><p><b>Discipline Powers</b>: You distort your own mind and perceptions, and can impress your altered states onto others.</p><p><i>Drug Resistance (Ex)</i>: When you ingest drugs, you take half as much ability damage (minimum 1). You also gain a +4 bonus on saving throws to avoid becoming addicted to a drug or to overcome being addicted (<i>Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide </i>236).</p><p><i>Cognatogen (Su)</i>: Once per day, you can create a cognatogen, a mutagen-like mixture that heightens one mental ability score at the expense of a physical ability score. When you imbibe a cognatogen, you gain a +2 natural armor bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus to the selected ability score for 1 minute per psychic level. In addition, while the cognatogen is in effect, you take a -2 penalty to one of your physical ability scores. If the cognatogen enhances your Intelligence, it applies a penalty to your Strength. If it enhances your Wisdom, it applies a penalty to your Dexterity. If it enhances your Charisma, it applies a penalty to your Constitution. Otherwise, this ability works just like the alchemist's mutagen ability (<i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide </i>28). When the effect of the cognatogen ends, you take 2 points of ability damage to the ability score penalized by the cognatogen. If you have both alchemist and psychic levels, these levels stack to determine the duration of your cognatogen and the DC of the save a non-alchemist must attempt if he drinks your cognatogen. If you gain discoveries, you can take the grand cognatogen and greater cognatogen discoveries to improve your cognatogen. The infuse mutagen discovery and the persistent mutagen class ability apply to cognatogens. However, even if you have alchemist levels, the duration of your cognatogen remains 1 minute per level (instead of 10 minutes per level) and you can still create only one per day (instead of an unlimited number) unless you also possess the cognatogen discovery.</p><p><i>Warped Brain (Su)</i>: At 5th level, your mind becomes difficult to comprehend. When another creature uses a mind-affecting spell or ability against you, that creature must attempt a Will save. If it fails, it becomes nauseated for 1 round. This ability triggers even if you succeed at your save (or are otherwise unaffected by the spell or ability), but doesn't apply if you're a willing subject of the spell. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p><p><i>Hallucinogenic Aura (Su)</i>: At 13th level, a mental field emanates from you, touching the minds of those nearby. Any creature within 30 feet of you must succeed at a Will save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at its saving throw is immune to your hallucinogenic aura for 24 hours. A creature that fails its save doesn't need to continue making saves while it's confused by this aura, and becomes immune for 24 hours once its confusion ends. This is a mind-affecting effect. You're immune to your own hallucinogenic aura, as well as that of any other psychic. You can brew an antidote that protects the imbiber from your aura. Brewing 1 dose requires 1 hour and a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check. One dose's effects last for 1 month.</p><h1>Rapport</h1><p>Forging a close bond with other people brings out the best in you, making it easier for you to link your mind with theirs. Through bonding your psyche with another person, you're able to fill in your own mental gaps and develop new psychic powers.</p><p><b>Phrenic Pool Ability</b>: Charisma.</p><p><b>Bonus Spells</b>: <i>Charm person </i>(1st), <i>enthrall </i>(4th), <i>coordinated effort</i>(APG) (6th), <i>lesser geas </i>(8th), <i>telepathy</i>* (10th), <i>battlemind link</i>(UM) (12th), <i>mass hold person </i>(14th), <i>mass charm monster </i>(16th), <i>overwhelming presence</i>(UM) (18th).</p><p><b>Discipline Powers</b>: Your powers meld several minds together, or allow you to more easily influence others.</p><p><i>Emotional Bond (Su)</i>: You can create an empathic link between yourself and your allies, allowing you to monitor their emotional states. Setting up the link requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted concentration from you and all subjects, who must remain within 10 feet of you. You can link with a number of allies equal to your Charisma modifier. This bond lasts until the next time you regain your spells, or until you go unconscious or voluntarily end the bond as a free action. If the bond ends, you can establish a new bond at will with another 10 minutes of mutual concentration. This link allows you to monitor emotions, detecting when allies become angry, surprised, confused, fearful, or the like, but doesn't allow them to communicate specific details. You can also easily tell whether a subject is unconscious. If a subject dies or moves to a different plane than you, your bond with that creature is severed. The distance between you and the subjects doesn't affect the bond as long as you're on the same plane of existence. At 4th level, the bond also gives you the benefits of the <i>status </i>spell with all subjects of the emotional bond.</p><p><i>Emotional Push (Su)</i>: You can draw upon the intense power of your own emotions in desperate situations, and your allies can call upon you through your emotional link to protect themselves. When you or a subject of your emotional bond must attempt a saving throw, the person attempting the save can gain a bonus equal to your Charisma bonus on the save as an immediate action. This ability can be used once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 4 psychic levels you possess. Allies using this ability don't need your permission, since the emotional connection is so direct, though you know when one of the uses has been expended. If the ally's saving throw is successful, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool.</p><p><i>Share Memory (Sp)</i>: At 5th level, you can use <i>share memory</i>(UM) at will, but only with a willing target.</p><p><i>Team Player (Ex)</i>: At 5th level and 13th level, you gain a bonus teamwork feat.</p><p><i>Shared Skill (Ex)</i>: At 13th level, each time you set up an emotional bond, you can choose one Intelligence- or Charisma-based skill from the list of psychic's class skills. Any subject of your bond can use your bonus instead of his own when attempting checks with that skill as long as the bond lasts.</p><h1>Self-Perfection</h1><p>You take a holistic view of psychic power, believing that you must hone both your mental and physical attributes to remain in balance. The focus you find while exercising, fasting, and otherwise tending to your body broadens your psychic powers.</p><p><b>Phrenic Pool Ability</b>: Wisdom.</p><p><b>Bonus Spells</b>: <i>Expeditious retreat </i>(1st), <i>bear's endurance </i>(4th), <i>haste </i>(6th), <i>freedom of movement </i>(8th), <i>echolocation</i>(UM) (10th), <i>transformation </i>(12th), <i>ethereal jaunt </i>(14th), <i>iron body </i>(16th), <i>akashic form</i>* (18th).</p><p><b>Discipline Powers</b>: Your powers alter your body through your force of will.</p><p><i>AC Bonus (Ex)</i>: When unarmored and unencumbered, you add your Wisdom bonus (if any) to your AC and CMD. The bonus to AC applies even against touch attacks or when you're flat-footed. You lose these bonuses when you're immobilized or helpless, when you wear any armor, when you carry a shield, or when you carry a medium or heavy load.</p><p><i>Physical Push (Su)</i>: By channeling your psychic energy, you can make your body capable of greater physical feats.</p><p>When you attempt a Strength-, Dexterity-, or Constitution-based ability check or skill check, you can gain a bonus on the check equal to your Wisdom bonus. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier. Using this ability is part of the action used to attempt the skill check (if any). If you succeed at the check, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool.</p><p><i>Bodily Purge (Su)</i>: You can heal your own wounds and maladies with the power of thought alone. At 5th level, you gain access to a daily pool of healing energy. This pool starts with 3 d8 dice per day, and gains 1 additional d8 for every 2 psychic levels you possess beyond 5th. As a standard action, you can use up any number of these dice to regain a number of hit points equal to the result of rolling that many d8s. For example, at 5th level you could regain 3d8 hit points all at once, 1d8 hit points three separate times, or 1d8 hit points once and 2d8 hit points at a different time. In addition, you can expend 2 dice from this pool to instead gain the benefit of <i>lesser restoration </i>(affecting yourself only). At 7th level, you can expend 3 dice from this pool to instead gain the benefit of <i>neutralize poison</i>, <i>remove disease</i>, or <i>restoration </i>(affecting yourself only). To use <i>restoration </i>to dispel a permanent negative level, you must expend 4 dice from this pool instead of 3. Use your psychic level as your caster level for these effects.</p><p><i>Pure Body (Ex)</i>: At 13th level, you gain immunity to diseases and poisons.</p><h1>Tranquility</h1><p>Psychic magic flows through you when you attain a peaceful mental state. Regular meditation expands your mind, allowing new powers to develop.</p><p><b>Phrenic Pool Ability</b>: Wisdom.</p><p><b>Bonus Spells</b>: <i>Telempathic projection</i>* (1st), <i>silence </i>(4th), <i>mantle of calm</i>(ACG) (6th), <i>mass daze</i>(UM) (8th), <i>serenity</i>(UM) (10th), <i>psychic surgery</i>* (12th), <i>mind blank </i>(14th), <i>euphoric tranquility</i>(APG) (16th), <i>time stop </i>(18th).</p><p><b>Discipline Powers</b>: Your stable mind protects you and your allies.</p><p><i>Mental Placidity (Su)</i>: As an immediate action, you can gain a +2 bonus on a Will saving throw you are about to attempt. This bonus increases to +4 against an enchantment spell or effect. Any ally who attempts a saving throw against the same effect gains a +1 bonus on the Will save, or a +2 bonus if the effect is an enchantment. If you succeed at the saving throw, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier.</p><p><i>Calming Presence (Su)</i>: At 5th level, you become a calming force. You can use <i>calm emotions </i>as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier.</p><p><i>Purge Disquiet (Su)</i>: At 13th level, you can banish mental distress. You become immune to fear spells and effects and to the confused condition. As a standard action, you can choose a willing creature that is either within 30 feet or in telepathic contact with you. For 1 round per psychic level you possess, you suppress any fear effect or confused, cowering, frightened, panicked, or shaken condition affecting that creature. You can suppress only one effect at a time with this ability, and choosing a new target ends the suppression for the character you previously chose.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1occultclasses\">^Occult Classes</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypes\">Archetypes</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"6FtCWBk6cp3bJ2nt"}
{"name":"Mindscapes","permission":{"default":0,"JgpLZkPryhl1EFab":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_4751keynkw3","path":"Pathfinder RPG - Occult Adventures Reference Library#/CF_SEP/Occult Adventures#/CF_SEP/CHAPTER 6: RUNNING AN OCCULT GAME","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\"></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Mindscapes are temporary constructs of the mind that come into being on the Astral Plane and fade away again, in much the same way a sleeping person's imagined landscape forms and dissolves while he is dreaming. The primary difference between a mindscape and a dream is one of intent; a creature often deliberately and precisely constructs a mindscape, while a dreamer typically does not. A mindscape can come into existence as a result of creatures engaging in a psychic duel (see page 202), as well as through certain spells, magic items, rituals, and other occult phenomena.</p><p>In theory, a mindscape can take on any form or appearance-and can possess any conceivable trait-in much the same way the various planes do. In practice, mindscapes often either appear mostly normal, or</p><p>feature only one or two traits that stray from reality, and creatures' psychic avatars manifesting within the mindscape might not be able to tell they're no longer in the real world.</p><p>Two types of mindscape exist: binary mindscapes and immersive mindscapes. Binary mindscapes occur during psychic duels, when a creature with psychic powers draws another into a mental battle. Only two participants can occupy a binary mindscape. This cerebral combat arena does not totally engulf the participants' senses; a creature engaged in a psychic duel within a binary mindscape can still perceive the real world, but is largely consumed in her psychic battle. In this case, the mindscape is a powerful image in the mind's eye, perceived on an abstract level and capable of affecting the subject in the real world, detaching her from events in the real world but leaving her still capable of perceiving them.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Immersive mindscapes are far more tangible and realistic. In an immersive mindscape, a creature's every sense perceives its imaginary surroundings completely, in effect replacing the body's actual sensory perceptions.</p><p>While a creature's consciousness is within a mindscape, that creature's body in the real world can take no actions and loses its Dexterity bonus to AC, but it isn't considered helpless, as the unconscious parts of the creature's mind still provide resistance to the creature's destruction. While in an immersive mindscape, the mind gets no information about what the body sees, hears, smells, or touches. Thus, if the body takes damage from an attack in the real world, the mind remains unaware of it. A binary mindscape, however, allows a creature to monitor its own condition in the real world.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Mental Masks</h1><p>Creatures drawn into mindscapes don't have to appear as themselves, and can instead assume alternate forms called mental masks. They can do so only if they know they're in a mindscape or believe they're in a dream (the creator of a mindscape almost always does). A mental mask allows a creature to hide its true identity, masking its true features from its enemies. Non-psychic creatures can't assume a mental mask; they must appear in immersive mindscapes in their true forms.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Binary Mindscapes</h1><p>A binary mindscape is typically only a minimalist backdrop for a psychic battle-a ghostly image, like a stark memory, lacking detail and verisimilitude. It might manifest as a flat surface surrounded by fog or a featureless plain of grass on a cloudy day. Sometimes, a binary mindscape mimics a real-world locale the creator knows well, but even then, the details at the edges of vision are usually fuzzy and indistinct, and features that invoke lesser senses, such as smell and taste, are lacking. A binary mindscape has no effect on the psychic battle; it's merely a mental construct used to assist the participants in visualizing their actions.</p><h1>Creation and Control</h1><p>As explained in the Psychic Duels section in Chapter 5, a binary mindscape is created when two psychic creatures enter a mental confrontation. Only creatures able to cast the <i>instigate psychic duel </i>spell can begin a psychic duel. Once a connection is established, the binary mindscape is created.</p><p>Once within the mindscape, a creature can expend psychic energy to create mental hazards called manifestations to damage the other combatant or to reshape the mental landscape. Because the mindscape becomes a shared mental space after its creation, neither participant in the battle truly controls it, and they both have an equal ability to alter the environment once their minds are connected.</p><p>A binary mindscape is overt, finite, and harmful (see Mindscape Traits below). Its other traits (such as gravity, time, and magic) are normal, with the exception of the special actions and limitations on spellcasting described in the Psychic Duels section.</p><h1>Immersive Mindscapes</h1><p>An immersive mindscape is a less common, but far more powerful, variety of mindscape. When created, it seems every bit as palpable and vivid as the real world. A being within an immersive mindscape can see the land, feel the breeze, hear the falling rain, smell the sea, and even experience hunger and thirst. In some cases, creatures within an immersive mindscape don't even realize that's where they are. A target that's fooled into believing such a mindscape is real wastes away in the physical world while living a full life in the mindscape.</p><p>An immersive mindscape can be sculpted in much more detail than a binary mindscape, and its traits vary. The creator dictates the traits of an immersive mindscape, and visitors are subject to whatever strictures the host is able to place upon the mindscape. The construction of the mindscape might be carefully designed, or might be a more instinctive expression drawn from the creator's own desires or intentions (whether conscious or subconscious). Some spells allow the creator to use a target's memories or desires when creating the mindscape to better fool the target.</p><h1>Mindscape Traits</h1><p>Each mindscape has a set of specific traits that dictate its appearance and behavior, just as the planes do. These traits supersede the normal planar traits of the Astral Plane (<i>GameMastery Guide </i>191). Often these traits mimic those of the Material Plane, for that is what the beings within a mindscape typically find most familiar and comfortable. A creature's mental avatar has the same physical characteristics in the mindscape that the creature does in real life (the same AC, hit points, ability scores, and so on). Weapons and armor, even magical ones, function inside the mindscape.</p><p>Every mindscape is considered sentient (<i>GameMastery Guide </i>186), but instead of changing according to its own will, it responds to the will of those inside it. Typically, the creature that created the mindscape controls its traits.</p><p>Depending on her level of expertise, the creator can alter one or more of the traits of the mindscape to suit her purposes. The psychic duel rules and some spells allow other creatures to alter mindscapes, but usually only if they're aware they're within one.</p><h1>Transparency</h1><p>A mindscape's creator typically knows when she is within her own mindscape, but other creatures might not, depending on the type of mindscape.</p><p><b>Overt</b>: Overt mindscapes are obvious to anyone drawn into them. This might be because the individual deliberately hosts and invites others, or because targets know they're being psychically attacked and caught in the mindscape, and therefore understand what has happened to them. When a creature knows it is in a mindscape, it can exit more easily (using the <i>mindscape door </i>spell), but this knowledge makes the immersive mindscape no less real to it. It can still be affected by the mindscape, and can still take damage or gain conditions from a harmful mindscape (see Feedback below). Binary mindscapes are always overt.</p><p><b>Veiled</b>: The veiled immersive mindscape is the most insidious type. Its triggering mechanisms are designed to fool the target, trapping the creature in such a fashion that it doesn't realize its reality is a product of its or another's mind. The creator's memories provide the basis for the mindscape, and any place or phenomenon she hasn't experienced might be hard to replicate convincingly using only her imagination.</p><p>Psychic mindscape traps and spells often include a seamless transition from the real world to the mindscape in order to maintain the veil. For example, a chest trapped with a veiled immersive mindscape might trigger a visual and tactile continuation of the current situation, making the thief believe she still kneels before the container in the chamber where she found it. If the effect is done well and is powerful enough, the thief might live out several hours, days, or weeks of her life trapped in her own mind, while her body remains slumped before the chest, slowly dying from lack of food and water.</p><h1>Shape and Size</h1><p>When the mindscape is manifested, the creator decides on the shape and size of the mental locale. Each of the following categories is possible.</p><p><b>Finite</b>: A finite mindscape has clearly discernible boundaries and limits to its space. Either there is no way to move beyond those boundaries, or there is simply nothingness beyond them. A finite mindscape might be a cavity within an endless expanse of stone, or it could be the interior of a cottage with nothing beyond the doors and windows but blackness and oblivion. Binary mindscapes are always finite.</p><p><b>Infinite</b>: A mindscape of this shape and size stretches on forever, or at least those within it perceive it as such for all practical purposes. This might result in an endless void in three dimensions, perfectly flat ground that stretches as far as the eye can see, or an endless ocean. Individual objects within the mindscape might be defined by their limits, such as a building sitting in the middle of an endless plain, or a series of floating chunks of rock within the void.</p><p><b>Self-Contained Shape</b>: A mindscape exhibiting this physical trait might seem to go on forever, but its spatial relations actually fold back upon themselves, no matter which direction creatures within it travel. Such a mindscape might consist of an staircase that is somehow a loop, a winding tunnel that appears straight but starts and ends in the same place, or a tesseract where exiting on one side of the cube always returns the traveler to the opposite side. A self-contained medieval keep, for example, might allow travelers to exit the front gate only to find themselves reentering by the rear portal.</p><h1>Feedback</h1><p>Though they're mental constructs, mindscapes can sometimes cause physiological effects through mental feedback. A creator with exceptional psychic power might be able to create a mindscape that is harmless for her but harmful for all other inhabitants, but most mindscapes affect everyone in the same way.</p><p><b>Harmful</b>: Injuries and conditions inflicted upon individuals visiting a harmful mindscape are real. Any psychic attacks harm the body by convincing the brain that the damage is real. Binary mindscapes are always harmful.</p><p><b>Harmless</b>: Occupants of a harmless mindscape still feel the sensation of the environment or other creatures harming them, but injuries and conditions are not real- they cause no physical harm to the host's body. A creature that dies in a harmless mindscape wakes up none the worse for wear.</p><h1>Gravity</h1><p>The creator or controller of a mindscape determines whether gravity exists in that mindscape, and if it does, how strongly it exerts its pull.</p><p><b>Normal Gravity</b>: Gravity functions just as it does on the Material Plane.</p><p><b>Light Gravity</b>: Gravity's effect is reduced, and creatures can jump, fly, and lift heavy objects with less effort.</p><p><b>Heavy Gravity</b>: Gravity's effect is increased, and creatures find that jumping, flying, and lifting objects require more exertion.</p><p><b>No Gravity</b>: Gravity does not exist, and objects float in space wherever they are in relation to one another, unless they're set in motion by someone, in which case they travel in a straight line at a constant rate of speed until they collide with another object or a creature somehow changes their motion.</p><p><b>Subjective Gravity</b>: Gravity functions however each individual wishes it, relative to that individual. Thus, if one creature stands on the floor of a parlor, while another envisions the ceiling of that same room as being \"down\" and stands upon that surface, each would experience gravity differently and see the other as \"overhead\" and \"upside down.\"</p><h1>Time</h1><p>Controlling time within a mindscape is difficult. In most cases, time flows at a one-for-one ratio with the passage of time in the real world. Only a powerful psychic individual can alter the flow of time in a mindscape.</p><p><b>Normal Time</b>: Time flows normally.</p><p><b>Slow Time</b>: In certain cases, the creator of a mindscape might wish to cause time to slow down, forcing those within the mindscape to spend more real-world time engaged in activities within the mindscape. When this happens, 1 round within the mindscape takes 2 or more real-world rounds to complete.</p><p><b>Rapid Time</b>: In other instances, a mindscape's creator might desire to cause time to move faster within the mindscape than in the real world. In this instance, 2 or more rounds of activity within the mindscape could be completed while only 1 round passes in the real world. A controller could thus spend a great deal of time contemplating a complex mental puzzle, then emerge from the mindscape to rejoin her allies having lost no true time at all.</p><h1>Alignment</h1><p>Some mindscapes exhibit a palpable resonance that reflects the creator's alignment. This might be intentional or unintentional. Most mindscapes aren't aligned.</p><p><b>Mildly Aligned</b>: A mildly aligned mindscape results in very subtle effects that might or might not be noticed by its inhabitants. In such cases, the evidence might manifest as an orderly garden for a lawful creature or a serene bit of countryside with ideal weather for a good-aligned being.</p><p><b>Strongly Aligned</b>: A mindscape influenced by a strong alignment almost always exhibits noticeable characteristics. The atmosphere alone might cause discomfort for or even damage beings of a diametrically opposed alignment. A creator who wishes to create a strongly aligned mindscape might find it difficult to keep victims from noticing these features. The creeping alignment influence can give a clue to those trapped within that all is not as it seems.</p><h1>Magic</h1><p>Magic-particularly psychic magic-behaves in odd ways within a mindscape. In addition to the options below, see page 202 for further discussion on how magic works in binary mindscapes during psychic duels.</p><p><b>Normal Magic</b>: In an immersive mindscape where magic behaves normally, characters and creatures can use spells, spell-like abilities, and magic items as they normally would. Spells are consumed and charges or consumables are spent. Damage dealt by magic is real, and the real-world body suffers accordingly if the mindscape is harmful. However, any magic that requires physical manipulation (such as drinking a potion) might not behave in the expected manner (the character could \"drink\" the potion and discover that nothing happens). Some divination magic might provide strange or nonsensical information if it is providing details on what is going on in the real world while the caster's mind believes it is elsewhere. When a creature emerges from a mindscape, any magic it used while within has been consumed.</p><p><b>Dead Magic</b>: Magic might not work at all within a mindscape. The effort to summon and manipulate the energies required to set off the magic can be blocked, prevented from reaching through the psychic barrier of the creature or thing that created the mindscape. In such cases, the mindscape may or may not create false-positive results in an attempt to fool those trapped within (for example, making healing magic seem to work when it actually doesn't function). Whatever results occur within the mindscape, creatures emerge without having expended any magic. The sole exception is that psychic spells specifically designed to manipulate a mindscape work even in mindscapes with dead magic, and are expended normally.</p><p><b>Altered Magic</b>: Magic might behave very differently within a mindscape-use the rules for the enhanced, impeded, limited, or wild planar magic traits (<i>GameMastery Guide </i>187).</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter6runninganoccultgame\">^Running an Occult Game</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter7occultrewards\">Occult Rewards</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"6d8yd375q4sgVe5G"}

With new uses ranging from the ability to read psychic impressions from an object using Appraise to the power to dowse for water and more using Survival, skills will never seem mundane again.</p><h1>AURAS</h1><p>This section expands auras to include not just magic and alignment auras but also health and emotion auras. A master aura reader can tell what conditions afflict a creature, as well as the state of that creature's emotions.</p><h1>CHAKRAS</h1><p>Ki users with psychic abilities can use kundalini serpent-f ire energy to unlock their chakras for strange and powerful effects, starting with the humble root chakra and moving up to the mighty crown chakra.</p><h1>PSYCHIC DUELS</h1><p>Practitioners of the occult can pit their minds against each other in a terrifying psychic duel. Such psychic combatants enter a mindscape where they can create whatever they can imagine to form attacks, defenses, and even manifested allies called thought-form creatures.</p><h1>POSSESSION</h1><p>This section explains rules for possession magic, both new and old, including corner cases like what happens when you try to possess someone who's already possessed.</p><h1>OCCULT RITUALS</h1><p>Occult rituals are rare and powerful rites that anyone who knows the right secrets can perform.

GMs can use the kits to quickly round out an NPC's gear. Players can use them to equip new PCs in a hurry or provide gear to cohorts, followers, minions, and hirelings. The listed price for each kit includes a discount for purchasing these items as a group. Items in a kit that are used up, destroyed, or lost cost the full price to replace.</p><h1>Artist's Poster</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 15 Gp; <b>WEIGHT</b> -</p><p>This illustrated piece of paper typically measures 24 inches wide and 32 inches long. An artist's poster is typically used as an advertisement that can be easily seen by crowds of people. Placing a poster within a settlement grants creatures a +1 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information regarding the subject of the poster. If the settlement's population is greater than 1,000 people, one additional poster must be placed for every additional 1,000 people (or portion thereof) to gain the bonus. The cost of this item includes commissioning an artist of appropriate talent to complete the poster, and copies of the poster beyond the first cost 5 sp each.</p><h1>Aura Goggles</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 15 Gp; <b>WEIGHT</b> 1 lb.</p><p>These leather goggles have dark, purple-hued lenses coated with a special alchemical substance that reveals particular psychic spectrums. To provide any benefit, the goggles must be continuously worn for 1 hour, during which time the wearer takes a -2 penalty on all sight-based Perception checks. After this 1-hour period, the user can remove the goggles to gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Perception checks for the read aura occult skill unlock. This benefit fades after 1 hour.</p><h1>Automatic Writing Planchette</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>PRICE</b> 25 Gp; <b>WEIGHT</b> -</p><p>This finely crafted, heart-shaped wooden board has two delicate wheels and a small aperture to hold a pencil, which acts as the board's third leg. Typically used on a tabletop covered in butcher's paper, the device scribbles out mysterious messages when employed by a creature using the automatic writing occult skill unlock, and provides a +2 circumstance bonus on the Linguistics check. When used to channel certain haunts capable of communication (see page 230), the planchette doubles the rate of communication with the haunt, and grants the user a +4 circumstance bonus on Linguistics checks to decipher the cryptic messages. These benefits do not stack with those of other items that confer similar benefits (such as a talking board).</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Censer</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 5 Gp; <b>WEIGHT</b>  lb.</p><p>This metal container comes with a small removable lid, and holds a small crucible in which to burn incense. Used in religious ceremonies or rituals, a censer can hold up to 10 pieces of incense, and burns 1 piece per hour when lit.</p><h1>Dowsing Rod</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>PRICE</b> 10 Gp; <b>WEIGHT</b> 1 lb.</p><p>Made from specially crafted materials, a dowsing rod is used by the psychically attuned to locate water, find graves, or uncover minerals. Most commonly manufactured from forked branches cut from hazel, peach, or willow trees, dowsing rods can also come in other forms, such as bent, L-shaped rods of charged cold iron. Though a dowser can use any forked twig found in nature for dowsing, these specially prepared rods provide a +2 circumstance bonus on Survival checks for the dowsing occult skill unlock.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Fraudulent Medium's Kit</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 50 Gp; <b>WEIGHT</b> 10 lbs</p><p>This large suitcase contains a plethora of items useful to anyone pretending to channel spirits. The case contains candles, mirrors, and 10-foot-long telescoping rods, as well as a selection of specialty items: rigged chalkboards for spirit writing, mundane spirit trumpets for transmitting spirit voices, lengths of gaffed ropes for binding mediums during test seances, and luminous paints and ribbons of fine gauze for fake spectral manifestations.</p><p>Using the materials that are included with this kit provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Bluff, Escape Artist, and Sleight of Hand checks to imitate seances, spirit writing, or other occult practices.</p><h1>Hoodwink Cowl</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 75 Gp; <b>WEIGHT</b> 3 lbs.</p><p>This uncomfortable mask consists of a black cloth hood, padded leather earmuffs, and shuttered goggles that block vision. A creature wearing a hoodwink cowl is blinded and deafened, and it takes a -10 penalty on all other Perception checks.</p><h1>Hypnotist's Locket</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>PRICE</b> Varies; <b>WEIGHT</b> 1 lb.</p><table><tr><td>Locket</td><td><b>PRICE</b> 15 Gp</td></tr><tr><td>Pocket Watch</td><td><b>PRICE</b> 250 GP</td></tr></table><p>A small, elliptical metal case containing a small portrait or keepsake, a hypnotist's locket can be attached to a belt or worn as a pendant. When hanging from a metal chain, a hypnotist's locket grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks for the hypnotism occult skill unlock.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>A hypnotist's locket can also come in the form of a pocket watch. It can be worn the same way, still includes a space for a portrait or keepsake, and adds the same bonus for hypnotism, but it also functions as a timepiece.</p><h1>Incense</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 7 Sp; <b>WEIGHT</b> -</p><p>This aromatic resin is imbued with fragrant oils and formed into sticks, cones, or balls. It's often burned in religious ceremonies or during meditation. A piece of incense burns for 1 hour.</p><h1>Kineticist's Kit</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 8 Gp; <b>WEIGHT</b> 22 lbs.</p><p>This kit includes a backpack, a belt pouch, a blanket, torches (10), trail rations (5 days), and a waterskin.</p><h1>Medium's Kit</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 40 Gp; <b>WEIGHT</b> 14 lbs.</p><p>This kit includes tools that aid in contacting supernatural beings. It includes an automatic writing planchette, candles (10), candlesticks(UE) (10), holly and mistletoe, incense (10 sticks), a scholar's outfit, a spell component pouch, and a wooden holy symbol.</p><h1>Mesmerist's Kit</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 35 Gp; <b>WEIGHT</b> 26  lbs</p><p>This kit includes a backpack, a bedroll, a belt pouch, an entertainer's outfit, flint and steel, a hypnotist's locket, ink (1 ounce), an inkpen, an iron pot, stationery(UE), torches (10), trail rations (5 days), and a waterskin.</p><h1>Occultist Reference Material</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 80 Gp; <b>WEIGHT</b> 1 lb.</p><p>These books come in all manner of shapes and sizes, from hardbound, illustrated manuscripts to collections of journals, notes, and scrolls from multiple authors. When used as a reference (an action that typically requires 1d4 minutes of searching the text), occult reference material grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Knowledge checks related to the occult topic covered by that manual. Some common topics for occult reference materials include astral projection, auras, dreams, ley lines, medium spirits, and rituals. Occult reference materials devoted to general subjects-such as spirits as a whole-provide an overview but don't give enough detail to grant a skill bonus.</p><h1>Occultist's Implement</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 10 Gp; <b>WEIGHT</b>  lb.</p><p>This bauble, bit of clothing, or relic has some minor historical significance. Though not especially valuable, it's useful to an occultist, who can use it as an implement. Any such item is nonmagical, even if it appears to be a rod or wand. Implements that already have a mundane version with a price higher than 10 gp (such as armor, shields, weapons, and harrow decks) use their normal item entries instead of this catchall.</p><h1>Occultist's Kit</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 45 Gp; <b>WEIGHT</b> 32  lbs.</p><p>This kit includes a backpack, a bedroll, a belt pouch, chalk (10 pieces), flint and steel, ink (1 ounce), an inkpen, an iron pot, a journal(UE), occultist's implements (2), torches (10), trail rations (5 days), and a waterskin.</p><h1>Performer's Token</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 2 SP; <b>WEIGHT</b> -</p><p>Most commonly shaped like a coin, a performer's token is a small keepsake given out by stage performers prior to their presentations or used as a token of admission to closed-door performances. Similar tokens are also issued by mediums as calling cards prior to performing a seance.</p><h1>Phrenologist's Kit</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>PRICE</b> 50 GP; <b>WEIGHT</b> 5 lbs.</p><p>This leather doctor's bag contains all the accoutrements a phrenologist needs to measure skulls. This kit contains several metal skull calipers of various sizes, a labeled chalkware bust of a humanoid head, and numbered charts of skulls of various species. The kit provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Knowledge (arcana) checks for the phrenology occult skill unlock.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Portabler Solarium</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 800 GP; <b>WEIGHT</b> 35 lbs.</p><p>This long, wooden case contains a complicated framework of brass armatures, balance weights, a foldable mat, and purple-hued lenses of various shapes and sizes. When assembled, the case becomes a small bed over which looms a complicated, slowly revolving array of lenses that filter sunlight onto the mat below. Only usable on bright, sunny days, the solarium has enough room for one Medium or two Small creatures to recline beneath its lens array and bask in the healing rays of the filtered natural light. The solarium can be used in conjunction with the long-term care use of the Heal skill. Subjects who bask in the filtered light for an 8-hour rest period recover 1 additional hit point per level or 1 additional ability score point if their caregivers succeed at the required Heal check.</p><h1>Portable Sweat Lodge</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 25 GP; <b>WEIGHT</b> 25 lbs.</p><p>This large leather wrap contains a foldable wooden framework that sits on stilts, pliable slats of birch bark, additional leather rolls, and consecrated stones. When assembled, the resulting hut is a small dome, suitable as a tent shelter and large enough to fit two crouching Medium humanoids or four Small humanoids. When the stones are heated and water is poured over them to create a thick steam, the hut becomes a sweat lodge for healing ceremonies, and provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal checks for the faith healing occult skill unlock.</p><h1>Prismatic Crystal</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 30 GP; <b>WEIGHT</b>  lb.</p><p>This chunk of crystal shines with the colors of the rainbow. A prismatic crystal can be used as a focus for the read aura occult skill unlock to reduce the time needed to read an aura from 10 minutes to 5 minutes. When held by psychic creatures, these crystals also emit light in a small area, increasing the light level in a 10-foot radius by one step (darkness becomes dim light, and dim light becomes normal light). A prismatic crystal can't increase the light level above normal light.</p><h1>Prognostication Manual</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 30 GP; <b>WEIGHT</b> 3 lbs.</p><p>This small but thick booklet contains information on a specific form of folk divination, such as cartomancy, cheiromancy, crystallomancy, or horoscopy. Using such a book while reading a creature's fortune reduces the time needed to read that fortune by 2 minutes. When used as part of a Sense Motive check for the prognostication occult skill unlock, this book grants a +2 circumstance bonus. If the fortunetelling method requires a particular item, such as a deck of cards for cartomancy or animal bones for osteomancy, that item provides a +2 circumstance bonus that doesn't stack with the bonus provided by the prognostication manual.</p><p>A prognostication manual is useful primarily for cheiromancy (palm reading), horoscopy, and other methods that don't require special equipment.</p><h1>Psychic's Kit</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 35 GP; <b>WEIGHT</b> 27 lbs.</p><p>This kit includes a backpack, a bedroll, a belt pouch, flint and steel, a prismatic crystal, torches (10), trail rations (5 days), and a waterskin.</p><h1>Psychometrist's Glove</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 10 GP; <b>WEIGHT</b> 5 lbs.</p><p>These layered lambskin gloves are specially designed and psychically attuned to increase the tactile sensitivity of the wearer's hands. To provide any benefit, the gloves must be worn for 8 uninterrupted hours. All Dexterity skill checks requiring the use of the hands take a -2 penalty as long as the gloves remain on. After this 8-hour period, the user can remove the gloves to gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks for the psychometry occult skill unlock. This benefit fades after 1 hour.</p><h1>Ritual Bell</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 2 GP; <b>WEIGHT</b> 1 lb.</p><p>This large, handheld silver bell has a long wooden handle. Ritual bells are typically used for ceremonial purposes, often as a means of getting the attention of large audiences. Each ritual bell is specifically engraved, often denoting its origin with a particular cult or sect.</p><h1>Spirit Trumpet</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 25 GP; <b>WEIGHT</b> 1 lb.</p><p>This telescopic horn is constructed of thin sheets of tin rolled into concentric cones, and measures about 3 feet long when fully extended. Primarily used by fraudulent mediums to disguise the true source of mysterious voices in darkened seance chambers, these trumpets add 1 to the DCs of saving throws to disbelieve the effects of the <i>ghost sound </i>and <i>ventriloquism </i>spells. When used to channel a haunt capable of communication (see page 230), a spirit trumpet doubles the rate of communication with the haunt, and grants the user a +4 circumstance bonus on Linguistics checks to decipher the cryptic messages.</p><h1>Spiritualist's Kit</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 50 GP; <b>WEIGHT</b> 34 lbs</p><p>This kit includes a backpack, a bedroll, a belt pouch, a censer, a flask of ectoplasmic residue, flint and steel, incense (10 sticks), an iron pot, magnetized paper, torches (10), trail rations (5 days), and a waterskin.</p><h1>Straitjacket</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>PRICE</b> Varies; <b>WEIGHT</b> 1 lb.</p><table><tr><td>Common</td><td><b>PRICE</b> 5 GP</td></tr><tr><td>Masterwork</td><td><b>PRICE</b> 50 gp</td></tr></table><p>Fashioned of durable canvas and leather straps, this instrument of restraint prevents its wearer from using his arms entirely. Properly binding a creature in a straitjacket requires 1 minute, and the creature must be willing or helpless. This time can be reduced to 5 rounds, but doing so lowers the DC to escape the restraints by 5. A creature wearing a straitjacket gains the grappled condition, except it is able to move. Escaping from the straitjacket requires a successful DC 28 Escape Artist check (DC 30 for a masterwork straitjacket.)</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Talking Board</h1><p><b>PRICE</b> 15 gp; <b>WEIGHT</b> 2 lbs.</p><p>This thin, rectangular wooden board is printed with an arching array of alphabetical letters, numbers, and short affirmative and negative messages. Paired with a small, heart-shaped pointer on short wooden legs, this device enables communication with spiritual entities or the user's deep subconscious mind. A talking board can be used in place of a pencil and paper or a writing planchette when attempting a Linguistics check with the automatic writing occult skill unlock, and provides a +2 circumstance bonus on such checks. In addition, given the size of the board, the user can work in conjunction with another psychically sensitive creature who can bolster the attempt with a successful aid another check.</p><p>A user can also use the board alone to initiate the recall memory use of the hypnotism occult skill unlock. The user attempts the skill check as normal, with herself as the subject, and receives a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.</p><p>When used to channel a haunt capable of communication (see page 230), a talking board doubles the rate of communication with the haunt, and grants the user a +4 circumstance bonus on Linguistics checks to decipher the cryptic messages.</p><p>Though a talking board can be used for some of the same functions as other gear (such as automatic writing planchettes and hypnotist's lockets), these items can't be used in unison to gain multiple bonuses or increase the rate of communication with a haunt to more than double.</p><h1>Ventriloquist's Dummy</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>PRICE</b> 100 gp; <b>WEIGHT</b> 7 lbs.</p><p>A ventriloquist's dummy is made of finely sculpted and painted wood, shaped and dressed like a typical humanoid, and sized at roughly 2 feet. An insert in the back of the dummy allows a Small or Medium creature to manipulate it with one arm.

When a kineticist gains a new element via the expanded element class feature, she gains a simple blast from that element as well. Each simple blast is either a physical blast or an energy blast. Physical blasts are ranged attacks that deal an amount of damage equal to 1d6+1 + the kineticist's Constitution modifier, increasing by 1d6+1 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st. Spell resistance doesn't apply against physical blasts. Energy blasts are ranged touch attacks that deal an amount of damage equal to 1d6 + 1/2 the kineticist's Constitution modifier, increasing by 1d6 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st.</p><h1>Air Blast</h1><p><b>Element </b>air; <b>Type </b>simple blast (Sp); <b>Level </b>-; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Blast Type </b>physical; <b>Damage </b>bludgeoning</p><p>You batter a single foe with a gust of air.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Cold Blast</h1><p><b>Element </b>water; <b>Type </b>simple blast (Sp); <b>Level </b>-; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Blast Type </b>energy; <b>Damage </b>cold</p><p>You emit a beam of utter cold to freeze a single foe.</p><h1>Earth Blast</h1><p><b>Element </b>earth; <b>Type </b>simple blast (Sp); <b>Level </b>-; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Blast Type </b>physical; <b>Damage </b>bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing</p><p>You shape earth into clumps or shards and send them flying at a foe.</p><h1>Electric Blast</h1><p><b>Element </b>air; <b>Type </b>simple blast (Sp); <b>Level </b>-; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Blast Type </b>energy; <b>Damage </b>electricity</p><p>You shoot an arc of electricity to shock a single foe.</p><h1>Fire Blast</h1><p><b>Element </b>fire; <b>Type </b>simple blast (Sp); <b>Level </b>-; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Blast Type </b>energy; <b>Damage </b>fire</p><p>You unleash a gout of flickering fire to burn a single foe.</p><h1>Telekinetic Blast</h1><p><b>Element </b>aether; <b>Type </b>simple blast (Sp); <b>Level </b>-; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Blast Type </b>physical; <b>Damage </b>bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing</p><p>You throw a nearby unattended object at a single foe as a ranged attack. The object must weigh no more than 5 pounds per kineticist level you possess. If the attack hits, the target and the thrown object each take the blast's damage. Since the object is enfolded in strands of aether, even if you use this power on a magic weapon or other unusual object, the attack doesn't use any of the magic weapon's bonuses or effects; it simply deals your blast damage. Alternatively, you can loosen the strands of aether in order to deal damage to both the object and the target as though you had thrown the object yourself (instead of dealing your normal blast damage). You substitute your Constitution modifier for your Strength modifier if throwing the object would have added your Strength modifier on the damage roll, and you don't take the -4 penalty on the attack roll for throwing an object that wasn't designed to be thrown. In this case, the object's special effects apply (including effects from its materials), and if the object is a weapon, you must be proficient with it and able to wield it with one hand; otherwise, the item deals damage as a one-handed improvised weapon for a creature of your size.</p><h1>Water Blast</h1><p><b>Element </b>water; <b>Type </b>simple blast (Sp); <b>Level </b>-; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Blast Type </b>physical; <b>Damage </b>bludgeoning</p><p>You slam a single foe with a stream of water.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Composite blasts combine elements to form a new blast. When a kineticist gains a new element through expanded element, she gains access to all composite blasts for which she qualifies. Most composite blasts are either physical or energy blasts, like simple blasts. Physical composite blasts deal an amount of damage equal to 2d6+2 + the kineticist's Constitution modifier, increasing by 2d6+2 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st; energy composite blasts deal an amount of damage equal to 2d6 + 1/2 the kineticist's Constitution modifier, increasing by 2d6 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st.</p><h1>Aetheric Boost</h1><p><b>Element </b>aether; <b>Type </b>composite blast (Sp); <b>Level </b>-; <b>Burn </b>2</p><p><b>Prerequisites </b>telekinetic blast, expanded element (any)</p><p><b>Blast Type </b>special; <b>Damage </b>see text</p><p>You infuse a simple blast you know with aether, causing it to deal 1 additional point of damage of the same type for each of its damage dice; it otherwise acts as the simple blast. At 15th level, you can also infuse a composite blast with aether. To infuse a composite blast in this way, you must accept 1 additional point of burn.</p><h1>Blizzard Blast</h1><p><b>Elements </b>air and water; <b>Type </b>composite blast (Sp); <b>Level </b>-; <b>Burn </b>2</p><p><b>Prerequisites </b>air blast, cold blast</p><p><b>Blast Type </b>physical; <b>Damage </b>half piercing, half cold</p><p>You unleash a directed blizzard at a single target.</p><h1>Blue Flame Blast</h1><p><b>Element </b>fire; <b>Type </b>composite blast (Sp); <b>Level </b>-; <b>Burn </b>2</p><p><b>Prerequisites </b>primary element (fire), expanded element (fire)</p><p><b>Blast Type </b>energy; <b>Damage </b>fire</p><p>You unleash a concentrated blast of intense blue flame.</p><h1>Charged Water Blast</h1><p><b>Elements </b>air and water; <b>Type </b>composite blast (Sp); <b>Level </b>-; <b>Burn </b>2</p><p><b>Prerequisites </b>electric blast, water blast</p><p><b>Blast Type </b>physical; <b>Damage </b>half bludgeoning, half electricity</p><p>You slam a single foe with a stream of electrically charged water.</p><h1>Force Blast</h1><p><b>Element </b>aether; <b>Type </b>composite blast (Sp); <b>Level </b>-; <b>Burn </b>2</p><p><b>Prerequisites </b>primary element (aether), expanded element (aether)</p><p><b>Blast Type </b>energy; <b>Damage </b>force (see text)</p><p>You throw a burst of force at a foe.

{"name":"Mesmerist (ARCHETYPE)","permission":{"default":0,"JgpLZkPryhl1EFab":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_2339b90hqze","path":"Pathfinder RPG - Occult Adventures Reference Library#/CF_SEP/Occult Adventures#/CF_SEP/CHAPTER 2: ARCHETYPES","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\"></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>While mesmerists typically concentrate on purely mental arts, many look outward as well, focusing on physical combat or the creation of powerful tools with which to practice their craft.</p><h1>CULT MASTER (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>The leaders of some cults are simply charlatans, bathing in the adulation of their followers. Others believe themselves to be truly in touch with an unknown power, bringing their unique messages to those willing to follow and obey them.</p><p><b>Insidious Personality (Ex)</b>: A cult master adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Diplomacy checks. This ability replaces consummate liar.</p><p><b>Fanatical Stare (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a cult master can turn his gaze on a creature to fill it with fervent belief in the cult master. The target of the gaze gains a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls. This bonus increases by 1 for every 6 mesmerist levels the cult master possesses, to a maximum of +4 at 18th level. Instead of taking the hypnotic stare's penalty on Will saves, the target gains a bonus of an equal amount on Will saves. The bonuses don't apply to attacks against the cult master or on saves against the cult master's spells or abilities. The cult master can also suppress any penalties inflicted by his stare for the target. This ability replaces painful stare.</p><p><b>Cult Tricks (Su)</b>: The following new tricks can be selected by a cult master. These tricks can be implanted only in a cohort or follower of the cult master.</p><p><i>Double</i>: An illusion makes either the cult master's cohort or one of his followers appear to be him. The cult master can trigger this trick when he is targeted by an attack, provided he is adjacent to the subject, to give the attack a 50% miss chance. If the attack misses the cult master, it targets the subject instead. This is an illusion (glamer) effect.</p><p><i>Extol</i>: A mental compulsion causes a cohort or follower to extol the virtues of the cult master. The cult master can trigger this trick whenever he attempts a Diplomacy check, as long as he is within 60 feet of the subject. The subject takes the aid another action on the cult master's Diplomacy check. If the subject is successful, the cult master gains a +4 bonus on his check. This is an enchantment (compulsion) effect.</p><p>This ability alters mesmerist tricks.</p><p><b>False Healing (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, a cult master can provide temporary healing by using his psychic powers to trick the mind a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the cult master uses it on himself ), and the cult master must be able to touch his target. The cult master grants a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + his Charisma modifier to the target. At 6th level, the cult master can either grant a number of temporary hit points equal to 2d8 + his Charisma modifier to the target or temporarily remove 1d4 points of ability damage. A creature can receive the effect of the false healing only once per day. The temporary hit points or reduction in ability damage lasts a number of hours equal to the cult master's class level. This ability replaces the 3rd- and 6th-level touch treatments.</p><p><b>Faithful Followers (Ex)</b>: At 7th level, a cult master begins to attract followers to his espoused beliefs, thanks to his magnetic personality. The cult master gains Leadership as a bonus feat. This ability replaces the 7th-level bold stare.</p><p><b>Fanatical Devotion (Ex)</b>: At 10th level, a cult master has manipulated his cohort and followers into becoming utterly devoted to him. The cult master no longer takes a penalty to his Leadership score for being aloof or cruel. Additionally, the DCs of all enchantment spells the cult master casts on his cohort and followers increase by 4. At 14th level, the cult master no longer takes a penalty to his Leadership score for any cohorts or followers he has killed or caused to be killed. This ability replaces the 10th- and 14th-level touch treatments.</p><p><b>Masterful Cult Tricks (Su)</b>: The following new master tricks can be selected by any cult master of 12th level or higher. These tricks can be implanted only in a cohort or follower of the cult master.</p><p><i>Avenge Me</i>: The cult master creates a compulsion for one of his followers to avenge him. Whenever the cult master takes hit point damage from an attack, he can trigger this trick as long as he is within 60 feet of the subject. The subject is immediately affected as if by the <i>rage </i>spell for 1 round per mesmerist level.</p><p><i>Die for Me</i>: The cult master instills within either his cohort or one of his followers the desire to give her life for him. The cult master can trigger this trick whenever he would take hit point damage from an attack, spell, or effect and the subject is with 60 feet of him. Half the damage is psychically transferred to the subject. This is an enchantment (compulsion) effect.</p><p>This ability alters masterful tricks.</p><p><b>Reborn (Su)</b>: At 20th level, a cult master can ensure his own survival upon his death. The cult master can perform a 1-hour ceremony costing 5,000 gp in rare materials in which he uses his psychic powers to implant a small portion of his essence into his cohort, who must be a minimum of 17th level. When the cult master dies, in 7 days the cohort physically and mentally transforms into the cult master as if <i>clone </i>had been cast, except that the cohort's body takes the place of the inert body. The cult master can't use this ability again until he gains a new cohort of at least 17th level and performs the necessary ceremony. The cohort can't be brought back to life except through <i>miracle </i>or <i>wish</i>. This ability replaces rule minds.</p><h1>SPIRIT WALKER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Some mesmerists specialize in dominating and controlling undead rather than the living.</p><p><b>Spells</b>: A spirit walker adds additional spells to his spell list at the spell levels indicated: <i>hide from undead </i>(1st), <i>command undead </i>(2nd), <i>halt undead </i>(3rd), and <i>speak with haunt</i>(ACG) (4th). He can choose these as spells known, but doesn't gain them automatically. This ability alters the mesmerist's spell list.</p><p><b>Undead Inception (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a spirit walker can affect undead creatures with his hypnotic stare as the psychic inception bold stare ability. This allows him to affect only undead; he must actually choose the psychic inception bold stare improvement if he wants to also affect other mindless creatures. At 3rd level when the spirit walker uses this ability, undead targets don't receive a saving throw bonus (if they did to begin with), have only a 25% chance of ignoring the spirit walker's mind-affecting spells and abilities, and no longer need to be under the spirit walker's gaze to be affected. At 5th level, when the spirit walker uses his mind-affecting spells and abilities, they affect all undead normally, with no chance of failure. This ability replaces consummate liar and mental potency.</p><p><b>Continued Animation (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, when a spirit walker is using hypnotic stare on a humanoid target and the target dies, as an immediate action the spirit walker can force the target's soul to remain in the body. The spirit walker can then control the target as if using <i>dominate person </i>for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the spirit walker's class level. The creature gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 2 x the spirit walker's class level and continues acting as though it were alive and conscious until it loses those temporary hit points or the duration expires. During this time, the creature counts as undead, but it can't be healed by negative energy. The spirit walker can use this ability once per day for every 3 mesmerist levels he possesses. The target receives a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the spirit walker's class level + his Charisma modifier) to avoid this effect and die normally. This ability ends immediately if at any point the target's body is completely destroyed (such as by <i>disintegrate</i>) or restored to life. At 14th level, the spirit walker can apply this ability to any type of target as if using <i>dominate monster</i>. This ability replaces the 3rd- and 14th-level touch treatments.</p><p><b>Command Undead (Su)</b>: At 6th level, a spirit walker gains Command Undead as a bonus feat. A spirit walker can use Command Undead a number of times per day equal to 1 + his Charisma modifier (minimum 1), using his mesmerist level as his cleric level. At 10th level, the DC to resist this effect increases by 2. This ability replaces the 6th- and 10th-level touch treatments.</p><p><b>Master of the Dead (Su)</b>: At 20th level, a spirit walker gains mastery of the undead. Once per day, a spirit walker can use <i>control undead </i>as a spell-like ability on one target. If that creature fails its saving throw and has 20 or fewer Hit Dice, it falls permanently under the spirit walker's control until the spirit walker dies. A creature that fails its save but has more than 20 HD suffers the effect of <i>command undead</i>. A creature that succeeds at its save can't be affected by master of the dead for 24 hours. A spirit walker can control only one undead creature in this fashion at a time. If he permanently controls a new undead creature, the previous one is set free. This ability replaces rule minds.</p><h1>TOXITICIAN (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Toxiticians forgo the mesmerist's stare, instead combining their psychic power with their alchemical knowledge to craft injections that torment their foes and bolster themselves and their allies.</p><p><b>Deft Fingers (Ex)</b>: A toxitician adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Sleight of Hands checks. This ability replaces consummate liar.</p><p><b>Injections (Su)</b>: At 1st level, the toxitician uses his skill with alchemy and his own psychic powers to create injections. The toxitician can create a number of injections per day equal to his mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier. It takes 1 hour to create the injections. An injection is inert until the toxitician attempts to use it, taking a swift action to infuse it with his psychic power to activate it.</p><p>Using an injection requires taking a standard action to attempt a melee touch attack. If the attack hits, the target of an injection takes a -2 penalty on its Will saving throws for a number of minutes equal to 1/2 the toxitican's class level (minimum 1). The penalty becomes -3 at 8th level.</p><p>The toxitician can simultaneously attempt a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check to inject the target surreptitiously. If the toxitician uses Sleight of Hand, the target can attempt a Perception check to detect the attempt, opposed by the Sleight of Hand check result, but detecting the attempt doesn't prevent the creature from being injected. Whenever the toxitician uses Sleight of Hand to administer one of his injections, he can implant it rather than injecting it and then trigger the effect of the injection at a later time. At any point before he regains his injections, the toxitician can trigger an implanted injection as a free action. The toxitician must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per mesmerist level) of the target of the implanted injection.</p><p>If either the melee touch attack or the Sleight of Hand check (if attempted) fails, the injection isn't delivered but can still be used again-once activated, it remains potent for 1 day. An injection that hasn't been administered becomes inert if it leaves the toxitician's possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping.</p><p>The penalties from multiple injections don't stack, nor do the penalties from injections stack with penalties from mesmerist stares or witches' evil eye hexes. Injections are mind-affecting effects.</p><p>This ability replaces hypnotic stare.</p><p><b>Painful Injection (Su)</b>: The toxitician's injection causes intense pain. This increases the damage the subject takes in the same way as the mesmerist's painful stare class feature. This extra damage is dealt automatically, without being triggered by the toxitician, but doesn't increase when the toxitician damages the target and can still be dealt only once per round. This ability replaces painful stare.</p><p><b>Injection Improvement (Su)</b>: At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a toxitician can select one improvement to add to his injections. The toxitician can't choose the same improvement more than once. The toxitician doesn't have to select the improvements when he prepares his injections at the start of the day; the choice is made as part of the swift action to activate the injection. The target can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to resist an injection with an improvement added to it. The DC is 10 + 1/2 the toxitician's class level + the toxitician's Charisma modifier. On a successful save, the target still takes the penalty on its Will saving throws, but not the effects of the improvement. A toxitician can, as a free action, sacrifice one use of his injections to increase the DC of another injection by 2.</p><p><i>Ability Decrease</i>: The target takes a -2 penalty to one ability score of the toxitician's choosing. At 11th level, the penalty becomes -4.</p><p><i>Excruciating</i>: The extra damage from painful injection increases by an amount equal to 2 points + 1 point per 3 mesmerist levels the toxitician possesses.</p><p><i>Fortitude Decrease</i>: The target's immune system weakens, imposing a -2 penalty on Fortitude saving throws. At 11th level, the penalty becomes -4.</p><p><i>Natural Armor Decrease</i>: The target's skin becomes looser, decreasing its natural armor (if any) by 2. At 11th level, its natural armor bonus instead decreases by 4.</p><p><i>Reflex Decrease</i>: The target's body becomes stiffer, imposing a -2 penalty on the target's Reflex saving throws. At 11th level, the penalty becomes -4.</p><p><i>Slow</i>: The target's actions become sluggish, reducing its base movement by 10 feet and imposing a -1 penalty on attack rolls. At 11th level, the penalty on attack rolls becomes -2.</p><p>This ability replaces bold stare.</p><p><b>Treatment Vials (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, a toxitician can create treatment vials when he creates his injections for the day; creating each treatment vial expends one use of touch treatment. A treatment vial has the same benefit as his touch treatment, but anyone can administer it as a standard action. A vial can remove any condition the toxitician is able to remove at his mesmerist level, but can't be used for a <i>break enchantment </i>effect. A treatment vial becomes inert after 24 hours. This ability alters touch treatment.</p><p><b>Improved Injections (Su)</b>: At 11th level, the toxitician can add two different improvements to an injection. The injection still requires only one save. This ability replaces glib lie.</p><h1>VEXING DAREDEVIL (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Vexing daredevils train their psychic powers for combat, specializing in momentarily blinding and confusing their foes with sudden feints and tricks.</p><p><b>Class Skills</b>: A vexing daredevil adds Acrobatics (Dex) to her list of class skills. This alters the mesmerist's class skills.</p><p><b>Martial Weapon Proficiency (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a vexing daredevil picks one martial weapon and becomes proficient in its use. This ability replaces the 1st-level mesmerist trick.</p><p><b>Bonus Feats</b>: A vexing daredevil gains Improved Feint as a bonus feat at 3rd level, Greater Feint as a bonus feat at 6th level, and Greater Mesmerizing Feint* as a bonus feat at 10th level. She doesn't need to meet the prerequisites for these feats. At 14th level, she gains a bonus stare feat; she must meet the prerequisites of that feat. These bonus feats replace touch treatment.</p><p><b>Dazzling Feint (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, each time a vexing daredevil successfully feints against a creature under the effect of her hypnotic stare, she also chooses one of her dazzling feint benefits to activate. Unless otherwise stated, a dazzling feint's benefit applies only on the vexing daredevil's next attack this round. She selects one dazzling feint at 3rd level and another every 4 levels thereafter. The DC for any saving throw against a dazzling feint's effect is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vexing daredevil's class level + her Charisma modifier. The vexing daredevil can't choose the same dazzling feint more than once.</p><p><i>Blinding Strike</i>: The vexing daredevil's weapon emits a bright flash of light into the opponent's eyes. If the vexing daredevil's next attack hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be blinded for 1 round.</p><p><i>Combat Maneuver</i>: The vexing daredevil's attack patterns become more difficult to discern. The vexing daredevil chooses one combat maneuver when making this dazzling feint. For the rest of the round, she doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity when performing that combat maneuver against the target of her dazzling feint. This dazzling feint benefit applies on combat maneuvers instead of on the vexing daredevil's next attack.</p><p><i>Critical Strike</i>: Ever alert, the vexing daredevil hones in on the target's weak points. If her next attack is a critical threat against the target of this dazzling feint, the vexing daredevil gains a circumstance bonus on the roll to confirm that critical hit equal to +1 for every 3 mesmerist levels she possesses.</p><p><i>Outmaneuver</i>: The vexing daredevil's darting movements foil the target's attempts to box her in. If her next attack hits, the vexing daredevil gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks to move through the target's space or threatened area for 1 round. She can also move up to half her speed after the attack hits as a free action. If she wants to use Acrobatics to move through the target's threatened area or an enemy's space during this movement, she must reduce her speed or the DC of the Acrobatics check increases by 10, as normal.</p><p><i>Piercing Strike</i>: By psychically amplifying the target's pain, the vexing daredevil causes more damage. If she hits with her next attack and deals damage with her painful stare, she increases the damage dice from d6s to d8s.</p><p><i>Sloppy Defense</i>: The vexing daredevil's attacks effortlessly penetrate the target's defenses; she gains a +1 circumstance bonus on her next attack roll for every 5 mesmerist levels she possesses.</p><p><i>Surprise Strike</i>: The vexing daredevil creates an opening so she can squeeze in another strike. If her next attack hits, she can make another attack at her highest attack bonus - 5 as a free action. The vexing daredevil must be at least 7th level to select this dazzling feint. This ability replaces bold stare.</p><p><b>Shimmering Body (Sp)</b>: At 11th level, when a vexing daredevil moves in a round, until the beginning of her next turn, any target of her hypnotic stare sees her as a constantly shimmering form of light and treats her as if she were under a <i>blur </i>spell. This ability replaces glib tongue.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypes\">^Archetypes</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"G6kqb3kXpCRHlnhI"}

Classes that draw upon psychic magic do so via innate mental abilities, whether they directly cast spells, create elemental effects, or focus psychic energy through objects. Members of these occult classes find themselves drawn to the strange and the hidden; they have connections to the timeless Astral Plane, the haunted bleakness of the Ethereal Plane, and the history of the Material Plane chronicled as psychic impressions in places and objects.</p><p>Psychic magic is a third type of magic that functions differently from arcane and divine magic. The rules for casting psychic spells appear on page 144 of Chapter 4: Psychic Magic. The occult classes' spell lists include many new spells from Chapter 4, allowing them to fully express their mental powers. These spells, like other new rules elements from this book, are marked with an asterisk (*).</p><h1>CLASSES</h1><p>The six new classes presented in this book all use psychic magic. In most cases, this means they cast psychic spells. The new classes are as follows.</p><p><b>Kineticist</b>: With a connection to the elements, a kineticist can bring forth energy in the form of kinetic blasts. Instead of casting psychic spells, the kineticist uses unique psychic spell-like abilities called wild talents to manipulate elemental energy and matter.</p><p><b>Medium</b>: By contacting spirits in places of power, the medium allows the personalities of legendary heroes to overcome his own, vastly changing his abilities and spells. He holds seances to benefit himself and his allies.</p><p><b>Mesmerist</b>: A mesmerist's piercing stare lets him insinuate himself into other people's minds. A master of enchantment and illusion, the mesmerist controls and influences the behavior of others.</p><p><b>Occultist</b>: To make use of his powers, an occultist channels psychic energy into a varied collection of antiques and mementos with storied pasts. Every type of implement allows him to use a different school of magic.</p><p><b>Psychic</b>: With her incredibly potent mind, the psychic can cast spells that are more powerful than those of members of any other occult class. She accesses these spells through a specific discipline, and can bend and amplify psychic spells as she casts them.</p><p><b>Spiritualist</b>: Attuned to the spirits of the dead, a spiritualist forms a bond with a phantom-a returned spirit that has unfinished business but did not become undead. This spectral ally can alternate between forms, emerging from the safety of the spiritualist's mind to take on an incorporeal form or an ectoplasmic body.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1occultclasses\">^Occult Classes</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypes\">Archetypes</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"GvfwtSsJmYUI9AyG"}

           <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>CLASS FEATURES</h1><p>The following are the class features of the psychic.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: A psychic is proficient with all simple weapons, but not with any type of armor or shield.</p><p><b>Spells</b>: A psychic casts psychic spells drawn from the psychic class's spell list (see page 69). She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a psychic must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a psychic's spell is equal to 10 + the spell's level + the psychic's Intelligence modifier.</p><p>A psychic can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-7: Psychic. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1-3 on page 17 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>).</p><p>The psychic's selection of spells is limited. A psychic begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the psychic's choice. At each new psychic level, she learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-8: Psychic Spells Known. Unlike a psychic's spells per day, the number of spells a psychic knows isn't affected by her Intelligence score; the numbers on Table 1-8 are fixed.</p><p>At 4th level and every even-numbered level thereafter (6th, 8th, and so on), a psychic can choose to learn a single new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the psychic loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell from the psychic's class list that the psychic can cast. A psychic can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level.</p><p>A psychic need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any psychic spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.</p><p><b>Knacks</b>: Psychics learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-8. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they don't consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots (due to metamagic feats, for example) consume spell slots as normal.</p><p><b>Phrenic Pool (Su)</b>: A psychic has a pool of supernatural mental energy that she can draw upon to manipulate psychic spells as she casts them. The maximum number of points in a psychic's phrenic pool is equal to 1/2 her psychic level + her Wisdom or Charisma modifier, as determined by her psychic discipline. The phrenic pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours don't need to be consecutive. The psychic might be able to recharge points in her phrenic pool in additional circumstances dictated by her psychic discipline. Points gained in excess of the pool's maximum are lost.</p><p><b>Phrenic Amplifications</b>: A psychic develops particular techniques to empower her spellcasting, called phrenic amplifications. The psychic can activate a phrenic amplification only while casting a spell using psychic magic, and the amplification modifies either the spell's effects or the process of casting it. The spell being cast is called the linked spell. The psychic can activate only one amplification each time she casts a spell, and doing so is part of the action used to cast the spell. She can use any amplification she knows with any psychic spell, unless the amplification's description states that it can be linked only to certain types of spells. A psychic learns one phrenic amplification at 1st level, selected from the list below. At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, the psychic learns a new phrenic amplification. A phrenic amplification can't be selected more than once. Once a phrenic amplification has been selected, it can't be changed. Phrenic amplifications require the psychic to expend 1 or more points from her phrenic pool to function.</p><p><i>Complex Countermeasure (Ex)</i>: The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to increase by 2 the DCs of concentration checks or caster level checks the linked spell requires enemies to attempt. For example, if the linked spell were <i>nondetection</i>, the DC of the caster level check for using a divination on the warded creature or item would increase. This increase also applies to checks to dispel, counterspell, or identify the linked spell. The bonus applies while the spell is cast and lasts for the spell's duration (if appropriate), to a maximum of 24 hours. The psychic can choose to spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to instead increase the linked spell's DCs by 4.</p><p><i>Conjured Armor (Su)</i>: By spending 1 point from her phrenic pool, the psychic grants any creature she conjures or summons with the linked spell a +2 deflection bonus to AC. This bonus lasts for 1 round per caster level or until the creature disappears, whichever comes first. This amplification can be linked only to conjuration (calling) or conjuration (summoning) spells. The bonus increases to +3 at 8th level and to +4 at 15th level.</p><p><i>Defensive Prognostication (Su)</i>: When casting a divination spell, the psychic sees a glimmer of her future. By spending 1 point from her phrenic pool as she casts a divination spell, she gains a +2 insight bonus to AC for a number of rounds equal to the linked spell's level. She can instead spend 2 points to increase the bonus to +4. This amplification can be linked only to divination spells.</p><p><i>Focused Force (Su)</i>: When casting a force spell, the psychic can increase the spell's damage by spending 1 point from her phrenic pool. Increase the die size for the spell's damage by one step (from 1d4 to 1d6, 1d6 to 1d8, 1d8 to 1d10, or 1d10 to 1d12). This increases the size of each die rolled, so a spell that dealt 4d6+3 points of force damage would deal 4d8+3 points of force damage instead. This amplification can be linked only to spells that deal force damage, and only if that damage includes a die value. A spell that already uses d12s for damage can't be amplified in this way.</p><p><i>Intense Focus (Ex)</i>: The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to gain a +2 bonus on any concentration check she attempts as part of casting the linked spell. She can choose to spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to instead gain a +4 bonus.</p><p><i>Mindshield (Su)</i>: The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to give one target of the linked spell a +2 morale bonus on Will saves for 1 round per psychic level (maximum 10 rounds). The psychic can instead spend 2 points to increase the bonus to +4. If the linked spell affects more than one creature, the psychic can spend the same number of points for each additional creature she wants to affect with this amplification. She must choose to spend either 1 point for each creature or 2 points for each creature; she can't grant different bonuses to different targets.</p><p><i>Mindtouch (Su)</i>: The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to probe one target's mind if that creature is affected by the linked spell. If the target of the linked spell fails its saving throw or is hit by the spell, the psychic detects its surface thoughts (as the 3rd-round effect of <i>detect thoughts</i>). If the linked spell doesn't already require an attack roll or allow a saving throw, the target can attempt a Will saving throw to avoid the thought-detection effect only; the DC is calculated using the linked spell's level (and all other bonuses that would apply if the linked spell allowed a Will save). This amplification can be linked only to spells that affect a target or an area. If the linked spell can affect more than one creature, the psychic can attempt to detect more than one target's thoughts by spending 1 additional point per creature beyond the first. She must select these targets when she casts the spell and spends the points. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p><p><i>Ongoing Defense (Su)</i>: The psychic can increase the duration of spells that improve her psychic defenses. She can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool when she casts any <i>intellect fortress</i>, <i>mental barrier</i>, <i>thought shield</i>, or <i>tower of iron will </i>spell to extend the spell's duration by 1 round.</p><p><i>Overpowering Mind (Ex)</i>: The psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to increase the Will save DC of the linked spell by 1. At 8th level, she can choose to instead spend 4 points to increase the DC by 2. At 15th level, she can choose to instead spend 6 points to increase the DC by 3. This amplification can be linked only to spells that have the mind-affecting descriptor and require a Will saving throw.</p><p><i>Relentless Casting (Su)</i>: The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to roll twice on any caster level checks to overcome spell resistance required for the linked spell and take the better result. Because she must decide to spend points from her phrenic pool when she starts casting a spell, the psychic must decide to use this ability before the GM calls for the caster level check.</p><p><i>Undercast Surge (Su)</i>: When the psychic undercasts a spell (see page 144), she can spend points from her phrenic pool to increase the spell's effective level, essentially using up a lower-level spell slot to cast a higher-level version of the spell. This costs 2 points per spell level increased. She can't use this ability to cast a version higher than the version she knows. For instance, a psychic who knows <i>mind thrust III </i>but not <i>mind thrust IV </i>could cast <i>mind thrust II </i>and spend 2 points to treat it as <i>mind thrust III</i>, but couldn't spend 4 points to treat it as <i>mind thrust IV</i>. This amplification can be linked only to spells that can be undercast.</p><p><i>Will of the Dead (Su)</i>: Even undead creatures can be affected by the psychic's mind-affecting spells. The psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to overcome an undead creature's immunity to mind-affecting effects for the purposes of the linked spell. This ability functions even on mindless undead, but has no effect on creatures that aren't undead. This amplification can be linked only to spells that have the mind-affecting descriptor.</p><p><b>Psychic Discipline (Ex or Sp)</b>: Each psychic accesses and improves her mental powers through a particular method, such as rigorous study or attaining a particular mental state. This is called her psychic discipline. She gains additional spells known based on her selected discipline. The choice of discipline must be made at 1st level; once made, it can't be changed. Each psychic discipline gives the psychic a number of discipline powers (at 1st, 5th, and 13th levels), and grants her additional spells known. In addition, the discipline determines which ability score the psychic uses for her phrenic pool and phrenic amplifications abilities. The DC of a saving throw against a psychic discipline ability equals 10 + 1/2 the psychic's level + the psychic's Intelligence modifier.</p><p>At 1st level, a psychic learns an additional spell determined by her discipline. She learns another additional spell at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, until learning the final one at 18th level. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1-8. Spells learned from a discipline can't be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p><p>Specific psychic disciplines are further described starting on page 64.</p><p><b>Detect Thoughts (Sp)</b>: At 2nd level, a psychic can use <i>detect thoughts </i>as a spell-like ability once per day. She can also expend any unused spell slot of 1st level or higher to cast <i>detect thoughts</i>. If she does so, she uses the level of the spell slot expended to determine the Will save DC. When a psychic gains this ability, if she knows <i>detect thoughts, </i>she can learn a different 1st-level spell in place of <i>detect thoughts</i>, losing the old spell in exchange for the new one.</p><p><b>Telepathic Bond (Sp)</b>: At 9th level, a psychic can use <i>telepathic bond </i>as a spell-like ability once per day, using her psychic level as her caster level. She can't leave herself out of a bond created in this way. She can also expend any unused spell slot of 4th level or higher to cast <i>telepathic bond</i>. Casting the spell using a higher-level spell slot gives no benefit on its own, but the psychic can apply metamagic feats that would increase the spell level to the appropriate level. For instance, if the psychic knows Extend Spell, she can use a 5th-level spell slot to cast extended <i>telepathic bond </i>as a full-round action. When a psychic who knows <i>telepathic bond </i>gains this ability, she can learn a different 4th-level spell in place of <i>telepathic bond</i>, losing the old spell in exchange for the new one.</p><p><b>Major Amplifications</b>: At 11th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a psychic can choose one of the following major amplifications in place of a phrenic amplification.</p><p><i>Dispelling Pulse (Su)</i>: The psychic can spend 3 points from her phrenic pool to entwine dispelling magic with a targeted spell. If the target is hit by the linked spell or fails its saving throw, it's affected as though the psychic had cast a targeted <i>dispel magic </i>spell on it. This effect can dispel only spells of the linked spell's level or lower. If the linked spell doesn't already require an attack roll or allow a saving throw, the target can attempt a Will saving throw to avoid the dispelling effect only; the DC is calculated using the linked spell's level (and all other bonuses that would apply if the linked spell allowed a Will save). This amplification can be linked only to a spell that targets one creature or object.</p><p><i>Dual Amplification (Ex)</i>: When the psychic uses this major amplification, she chooses two other amplifications or major amplifications she knows to apply to the same linked spell. She must spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to do so, plus the full cost of the two other amplifications. She can't apply the same amplification to the linked spell more than once, even if she can use that amplification for multiple different effects.</p><p><i>Mimic Metamagic (Ex)</i>: When the psychic gains this amplification, she chooses two metamagic feats; she need not have these feats to select them. When she casts a spell, she can spend points from her phrenic pool to apply one of the chosen feats to the linked spell without increasing the spell's level or casting time. She must spend a number of points equal to double the number of levels by which the feat normally increases a spell's level (minimum 2 points). If the metamagic feat alters the spell's casting time in a different way than the standard rules for a spontaneous caster using a metamagic feat (as in the case of Quicken Spell), it changes the casting time accordingly. The psychic can still apply metamagic feats she knows to the spell while using this amplification, increasing the casting time and spell level as normal. This amplification can be applied only to a spell that the chosen metamagic feat could normally affect, and only if the spellcaster can cast spells of a high enough level that she would be able to apply the metamagic feat in question to the linked spell. For example, an 11th-level psychic could spend 8 points to quicken a 1st-level spell, but couldn't quicken a 2nd-level spell because she's unable to cast 6th-level spells. This ability doesn't require her to have any free spell slots in the relevant level, however, so the psychic in the example could quicken a 1st-level spell even if she had cast all her 5th-level spells for the day. A psychic can select this amplification multiple times, adding two additional options to the list of metamagic feats she can apply using this amplification each time.</p><p><i>Space-rending Spell (Su)</i>: The psychic can warp space with her mind, teleporting herself as she casts her linked spell. She teleports herself 10 feet per point she spends from her phrenic pool (as <i>dimension door</i>). The maximum number of points she can spend in this way is equal to the linked spell's level.</p><p><i>Subordinate Spell (Ex)</i>: The psychic can divide her mind to cast a less powerful spell upon herself alongside her linked spell. The linked spell can't be lower than 5th level and can't take less than a standard action to cast. This applies to the actual casting time, so the psychic can't add a subordinate spell to a quickened spell. The subordinate spell's casting time must be 1 standard action or less, and its level can be no higher than the linked spell's level - 5. The subordinate spell must target only the psychic (even if it could normally affect other or multiple targets). The psychic must spend a number of points from her phrenic pool equal to 3 + double the subordinate spell's level. The subordinate spell acts as though it had been cast, and uses up one of the psychic's spells per day of its level. The effects of the two spells are separate, so each might require its own concentration check.</p><p><i>Synaptic Shock (Su)</i>: The psychic manipulates an enemy's mind with brute force, causing mental harm beyond that done by her linked spell. She can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool when casting a mind-affecting linked spell to select one of the spell's targets. If the target is affected by the linked spell, that target is confused for 1 round after the duration of the spell expires (or immediately, if the spell has an instantaneous duration). If the target succeeds at its save against the linked spell, it is instead confused for 1 round immediately. For each additional point the psychic spends from her phrenic pool, she can confuse one additional target of the linked spell. This amplification can be applied only to a mind-affecting spell that can affect a number of targets or that has an area. It has no effect on creatures that are immune to mind-affecting effects, unless the linked spell is able to affect such creatures (such as a spell that has both will of the dead and synaptic shock applied to it via dual amplification).</p><p><i>Turning Shield (Su)</i>: The psychic can turn her excess spell energy into a barrier that deflects weaker spells. She can spend a number of points from her phrenic pool equal to the linked spell's level to gain the benefit of <i>spell turning </i>for 1 round per psychic level. The number of spell levels she can turn is equal to the level of the linked spell.</p><p><b>Telepathy (Su)</b>: At 17th level, the psychic can mentally communicate with any other creature within 100 feet that has a language. It is possible to address multiple creatures at once telepathically, although maintaining a telepathic conversation with more than one creature at a time is just as difficult as both speaking and listening to multiple people at the same time. When a psychic who knows <i>telepathy </i>(see page 189) gains this ability, she can learn a different 5th-level spell in place of <i>telepathy</i>, losing the old spell in exchange for the new one.</p><p><b>Remade Self (Sp)</b>: At 20th level, the psychic is affected by one of the following spells as a constant spell-like ability: <i>arcane sight</i>, <i>fly</i>, <i>haste</i>, <i>heroism</i>, <i>nondetection</i>, or <i>tongues</i>. This ability is chosen when the psychic reaches 20th level and can't be changed. While the psychic is under the effects of this spell-like ability, each time she casts a psychic spell, she can link one phrenic amplification or major amplification she knows that has a point cost of 1 to that spell without spending any points from her phrenic pool. This amplification is in addition to the normal maximum of one amplification per spell.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1occultclasses\">^Occult Classes</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypes\">Archetypes</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"HXRxcD8O0DsZ6UeS"}

An occultist can select an implement school more than once, as noted in the implements class feature.</p><h1>Abjuration Implements</h1><p>Abjuration implements are objects associated with protection and wards.</p><p><b>Implements</b>: Amulet, armor, bell, bracers, brooch, cloak, holy symbol, shield.</p><p><b>Resonant Power</b>: Each time the occultist invests mental focus into an abjuration implement, the implement grants the following resonant power. The implement's bearer gains the benefits of this power until the occultist refreshes his focus.</p><p><i>Warding Talisman (Su)</i>: The implement wards against adverse effects. Whoever wears (or holds, for bells) the implement gains a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws for every 2 points of mental focus invested in the implement, to a maximum bonus of 1 + 1 for every 4 occultist levels you possess.</p><p><b>Base Focus Power</b>: All occultists who learn to use abjuration implements gain the following focus power.</p><p><i>Mind Barrier (Sp)</i>: As a swift action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to create a shield of mental energy around you that protects you from harm. The shield prevents a total of 2 points of damage per occultist level you possess. It lasts until the start of your next turn or until exhausted. For example, if you are 5th level, the mind barrier protects you from 10 points of damage; if you are hit by an attack that would deal 12 points of damage, the mind barrier is exhausted and you take 2 points of damage. You can activate this ability as an immediate action, but doing so costs 2 points of mental focus instead of 1.</p><p><b>Focus Powers</b>: In addition to gaining the base focus power, occultists who learn to use abjuration implements can select from the following focus powers when choosing the powers gained from their focus powers class feature.</p><p><i>Aegis (Su)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus and touch a suit of armor or a shield to grant it an enhancement bonus. The bonus is equal to 1 + 1 for every 6 occultist levels you possess (to a maximum bonus of +4 at 18th level). Enhancement bonuses gained via this ability stack with those of the armor or shield, to a maximum total enhancement bonus of +5. You can also imbue the armor or shield with any one armor or shield special ability that has an equivalent enhancement bonus less than or equal to your maximum bonus granted by this ability by reducing the granted enhancement bonus by the appropriate amount. The item must have an enhancement bonus of at least +1 (from the item itself or from aegis) to gain an armor or shield special ability. In either case, these bonuses last for 1 minute.</p><p><i>Energy Shield (Sp)</i>: As a swift action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to surround yourself with a shield that protects you from energy damage. Whenever you take acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, the shield absorbs the damage (as <i>protection from energy</i>). The energy shield can absorb up to 5 points of energy damage per occultist level you possess. This shield lasts for 1 minute or until its power is exhausted. Its effect doesn't stack with itself, with <i>protection from energy</i>, or with <i>resist energy</i>. You can activate the energy shield as an immediate action by expending 2 points of mental focus instead of 1. You must be at least 3rd level to select this focus power.</p><p><i>Globe of Negation (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 3 points of mental focus to create a stationary globe of negation. This globe is 10 feet in diameter and cancels any spell effect that is cast into or through its area. This functions as <i>globe of invulnerability</i>, but it affects spells of any level. The globe can negate a total number of spell levels equal to your occultist level, after which the globe collapses. Spells that exceed the number of remaining levels remove all remaining levels, but are weakened; any creatures targeted by such spells receive a +4 circumstance bonus on any saving throws against the spells' effects. The globe lasts for a number of rounds equal to your occultist level. It has no effect on spells originating within the globe-only on those that enter its area as or after they are cast. You must be at least 11th level to select this focus power.</p><p><i>Loci Sentry (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to set a ward about an area. This area has a maximum radius of 10 feet + 5 feet per occultist level you possess. Whenever a creature enters the area, a sentry manifested by your psyche appears and strikes out at the intruder. The affected creature must succeed at a Will save or be dazed for 1 round. You are immediately aware of the sentry's activation. The sentry lasts for up to1 hour per occultist level you possess, or until triggered. When you set the sentry, you can set any number of specific creatures to be immune to the sentry and thus avoid triggering it.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><i>Planar Ward (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 2 points of mental focus to surround yourself with a planar ward. Creatures not native to the plane that you are currently on take a -4 penalty on attacks against you, and you receive a +4 circumstance bonus on saving throws against the spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities of such creatures. This ward lasts for 1 minute.</p><p><i>Unraveling (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to unravel a magical effect. This functions as a targeted <i>dispel magic </i>spell, but you must be adjacent to the effect to unravel it. If the effect is created by psychic magic, you receive a +5 bonus on your caster level check to unravel it. If the effect targets an object in your possession, you automatically succeed at the check. You must be at least 5th level to select this focus power.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Conjuration Implements</h1><p>Implements used in conjuration allow the occultist to perform magic that transports or calls creatures.</p><p><b>Implements</b>: Bowl, brazier, compass, figurine, lantern, mirror.</p><p><b>Resonant Powers</b>: Each time the occultist invests mental focus into a conjuration implement, the implement grants the following resonant power. The implement's bearer gains the benefits of this power until the occultist refreshes his focus.</p><p><i>Casting Focus (Su)</i>: The implement empowers the bearer's ties to the worlds beyond, allowing his spells to maintain their power for a longer period of time. The bearer can add the implement as an additional focus component to any conjuration spell he casts that has a duration measured in rounds per level. If he does so, he adds 1 to his caster level for every 2 points of mental focus stored in the implement (to a maximum bonus equal to your occultist level). This increase applies only when determining the duration of the spell. Apply this increase after other effects that adjust a spell's duration, such as Extend Spell.</p><p><b>Base Focus Power</b>: All occultists who learn to use conjuration implements gain the following focus power.</p><p><i>Servitor (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to summon a servitor. This ability functions as <i>summon monster I</i>, but you can use it only to summon a single creature, and the effect lasts for 1 minute. At 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the level of the <i>summon monster </i>spell increases by 1, to a maximum of <i>summon monster VII </i>at 19th level. You can't have more than one servitor in effect at a time. At any time, you can expend 1 point of mental focus as a free action to extend the duration of an active servitor by 1 minute.</p><p><b>Focus Powers</b>: In addition to gaining the base focus power, occultists who learn to use conjuration implements can select from the following focus powers when choosing the powers gained from their focus powers class feature.</p><p><i>Conjure Implement (Sp)</i>: You can expend 1 point of mental focus to conjure any item that qualifies as an implement that you know how to use. This implement can be used as the item in question, functioning as a masterwork version of that item, and can also be used to cast your psychic spells, even though you did not select it at the beginning of the day. If you have more than one implement for the same school, decide which set of spells the conjured implement will grant when you first conjure it. The implement can't be used to store mental focus or create any effects that require mental focus. The implement lasts for 10 minutes per occultist level you possess.</p><p><i>Flesh Mend (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to heal a living creature with a touch. The creature is healed an amount of damage equal to 1d8 + your occultist level. For every 4 occultist levels you possess beyond 3rd, the creature is healed an additional 1d8 points of damage, to a maximum of 5d8+19 at 19th level. This has no effect on undead creatures. You must be at least 3rd level to select this focus power.</p><p><i>Mind Steed (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to conjure a spectral horse. This horse can be either Medium or Large, but it otherwise functions as <i>mount</i>. The horse lasts for 10 minutes per occultist level you possess. If you are at least 5th level, the mount's base land speed increases by 20 feet. If you are at least 9th level and you expend 1 additional point of mental focus, the mount can fly at a speed of 60 feet with good maneuverability, but doing so reduces the mount's duration to 1 minute per occultist level you possess.</p><p><i>Psychic Fog (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to create a cloud of fog. This fog lasts for 1 minute per occultist level you possess. It functions as <i>fog cloud</i>, except it can't be dispersed by wind. At 7th level, you can expend 1 additional point of mental focus when creating this fog, causing it to become more tangible and function as <i>solid fog</i>, except it doesn't slow down any creature that has psychic powers or that can cast psychic spells. When you create a solid fog in this way, its duration is reduced to 1 round per occultist level you possess. You must be at least 3rd level to select this focus power.</p><p><i>Purge Corruption (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to draw out the corruption from a creature. You must touch the target with your implement to use this power. This ability functions as either <i>neutralize poison </i>or <i>remove disease</i>, using your occultist level as the caster level. Each use of this ability can cure only one poison or one disease. You must be at least 5th level to select this focus power.</p><p><i>Side Step (Sp)</i>: You can create a temporary fissure in space by expending 1 point of mental focus. You can use this ability as part of a move action taken to move. The fissure begins in any square you designate and allows you to teleport to any other square you can see within 10 feet per occultist level. Stepping between these locations requires you to expend 5 feet of movement, and the movement through the rift does not provoke attacks of opportunity. This otherwise functions as <i>teleport</i>. You must be at least 7th level to select this focus power.</p><h1>Divination Implements</h1><p>Implements of the divination school grant powers related to foresight and remote viewing.</p><p><b>Implements</b>: Book, crystal ball, goggles, harrow deck, headband, lenses, planchette.</p><p><b>Resonant Powers</b>: Each time the occultist invests mental focus into a divination implement, the implement grants the following resonant power. The implement's bearer gains the benefits of this power until the occultist refreshes his focus.</p><p><i>Third Eye (Su)</i>: The implement allows its bearer to notice that which can't easily be seen. The implement grants a +1 insight bonus on Perception checks per 2 points of mental focus stored in it, to a maximum bonus equal to the occultist's level. If the occultist is 3rd level or higher and stores at least 3 points of mental focus in it, the implement also grants low-light vision. If the occultist is 5th level or higher and stores at least 6 points of mental focus in it, the implement also grants darkvision 60 feet. (If the bearer already has darkvision, the implement increases the range of the darkvision by 30 feet.) If the occultist is 7th level or higher and stores at least 9 points of mental focus in it, the implement also grants the effects of <i>see invisibility</i>. If the occultist is 13th level or higher and stores at least 12 points of mental focus in it, the implement also grants blindsense 60 feet. If the occultist is 19th level or higher and stores at least 15 points of mental focus in it, the implement also grants blindsight 30 feet.</p><p><b>Base Focus Power</b>: All occultists who learn to use divination implements gain the following focus power.</p><p><i>Sudden Insight (Sp)</i>: As a swift action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to gain an insight into your immediate future. You can use this foreknowledge as a free action before you roll any ability check, attack roll, or skill check to gain an insight bonus on that roll equal to 1/2 your occultist level (minimum +1). You can use your foreknowledge only once per turn, and if it's not used by the end of your turn, the insight fades and you gain no benefit.</p><p><b>Focus Powers</b>: In addition to gaining the base focus power, occultists who learn to use divination implements can select from the following focus powers when choosing the powers gained from their focus powers class feature.</p><p><i>Danger Sight (Sp)</i>: As an immediate action, you can protect yourself from harm by expending 1 point of mental focus. You can use this ability whenever you are the target of an attack or are required to attempt a saving throw against a special ability, spell, or trap. Doing so grants you an insight bonus to your AC or on your saving throw equal to 1/2 your occultist level. This bonus applies only to the next attack against you or saving throw you attempt, and if not applied by the end of the round, the protection fades and you gain no benefit. You must be at least 3rd level to select this focus power.</p><p><i>Future Gaze (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can gain an insight into the future by expending 1 point of mental focus. This functions as <i>augury</i>, using your occultist level as the caster level.</p><p><i>Mind Eye (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to create a mind eye-a magical sensor through which you can see and hear. The mind eye is invisible and its size is Fine, giving it an AC of 18. Any amount of damage to the eye destroys it, but it can be harmed by only spells or magic weapons. The eye moves with a fly speed of 60 feet with perfect maneuverability and can travel up to 1 mile away from you. You must concentrate as a standard action to direct the eye and receive sensory images through it. The mind eye sees as your eyes see, including any additional senses you possess (such as darkvision or <i>see invisibility</i>). The mind eye lasts for 1 minute per occultist level you possess. You must be at least 5th level to select this focus power.</p><p><i>Object Seer (Sp)</i>: As a full-round action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to gain insight into an object in your possession. You can ask one question, but that question must be tied in some way to the object, such as the nature of its power, the identity of the creature that last possessed it, or even where the object was when a certain event took place. You always receive an answer from the psychic impressions imprinted upon the item, but they are sometimes cryptic or misleading. This ability otherwise functions as <i>commune</i>. You must be at least 7th level to select this focus power.</p><p><i>Powerful Connection (Su)</i>: When casting a divination spell (such as <i>scrying</i>) that imposes a penalty on saving throws based on the physical connection you have to the target, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to double the penalty from a possession, garment, or body part. In addition, when casting any other divination spell that allows a saving throw, you can increase the DC of that save by 2 by adding an object, garment, or body part that belonged to the target as a focus component for the spell and expending 1 point of mental focus.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><i>Watchful Eye (Sp)</i>: You can expend 1 point of mental focus as a standard action to create an invisible sensor within 30 feet that watches a 5-foot-square area. Whenever any creature enters that square, you receive a mental image of the creature as long as you are on the same plane as the sensor. The sensor remains active for 10 minutes per occultist level you possess. The image will not wake you from slumber, although you do receive all of the images the sensor collected once you wake up. The sensor can be deceived by <i>invisibility </i>and similar magic. You can expend additional points of mental focus when creating the eye to increase the size of the square by 5 feet per additional point spent (to 10 feet square, 15 feet square, and so on).</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Enchantment Implements</h1><p>Enchantment implements allow the occultist to befuddle the mind and charm his foes.</p><p><b>Implements</b>: Censer, crown, helm, musical instrument, necklace.</p><p><b>Resonant Powers</b>: Each time the occultist invests mental focus into an enchantment implement, the implement grants the following resonant power. The implement's bearer gains the benefits of this power until the occultist refreshes his focus.</p><p><i>Glorious Presence (Su)</i>: The implement invokes the presence of those who have worn it in the past. The implement's wearer gains a +1 competence bonus on all Charisma-based skill checks and ability checks for every 2 points of mental focus invested in the implement, to a maximum bonus of 1 + 1 for every 4 occultist levels you possess.</p><p><b>Base Focus Power</b>: All occultists who learn to use enchantment implements gain the following focus power.</p><p><i>Cloud Mind (Su)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to cloud the mind of one foe within 30 feet. That foe is dazed for 1 round if the number of Hit Dice it possesses is less than or equal to or your occultist level. If it has more Hit Dice than your occultist level, it is staggered for 1 round instead. The foe can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect. Whether or not it succeeds at the save, the target is then immune to this effect for 1 day. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p><p><b>Focus Powers</b>: In addition to gaining the base focus power, occultists who learn to use enchantment implements can select from the following focus powers when choosing the powers gained from their focus powers class feature.</p><p><i>Binding Pattern (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to create a binding pattern of psychic energy that causes a living creature to become paralyzed. The target must be within 30 feet of you, and it can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect. If it fails the save, it is paralyzed for 1 round for every 2 occultist levels you possess. At the end of each of its turns, it can attempt another Will save to end the paralyzed effect and instead be staggered for the remaining duration. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. You must be at least 7th level to select this focus power.</p><p><i>Forced Alliance (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can alter a living creature's mind, causing it to see you as a friend and ally. If the creature is the same creature type as you, this power requires you to expend 1 point of mental focus; if it's is not, you must expend 2 points instead. The creature can attempt a Will save to negate this effect. If it fails the saving throw, the creature treats you as an ally and doesn't attempt to harm you (although your allies are not protected). You can call on the creature to aid you directly, but while doing so the creature can attempt a new Will save at the end of each round to end the effect. This effect otherwise lasts 1 round per occultist level you possess. This is a mind-affecting charm effect. You must be at least 5th level to select this focus power.</p><p><i>Inspired Assault (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can inspire a living creature with a touch by expending 1 point of mental focus. The creature receives a morale bonus on attack rolls equal to 1 + 1 for every 6 occultist levels you possess (to a maximum bonus of +4 at 18th level). This bonus also applies on saving throws against fear effects. This bonus lasts for 1 minute.</p><p><i>Mental Discord (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to disrupt the mind of one living creature within 30 feet. The creature can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect. If it fails the save, the creature can't concentrate on any spell effects and must succeed at a concentration check to cast any spell (DC = 15 + double the spell level). The affected creature takes a -4 penalty on this check if the spell includes a thought component. The creature takes a -2 penalty on all Will saving throws while under this effect. This effect lasts for 1 round per occultist level you possess.</p><p><i>Mind Slumber (Sp)</i>: By expending 1 point of mental focus as a standard action, you can lull a living creature into a deep mental slumber, forcing it to view the world as a dream. The target must be within 30 feet of you, and it can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect. If it fails the save, the creature falls asleep, although it still perceives the world around it as a dream. This doesn't cause the creature to fall prone, but it does drop whatever it is holding. The creature can't take any actions while in this state, but it isn't helpless- it perceives danger as part of its dream. The creature remains asleep for a number of rounds equal to your occultist level or until it takes any amount of damage, which immediately wakes it. At the end of each of its turns, it receives another Will saving throw to end the effect. The creature can be manipulated or examined without waking it, but it can't be moved from its square without waking it. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. Regardless of whether it succeeds at the save, the target is then immune to this effect for 24 hours. You must be at least 3rd level to select this focus power.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><i>Obey (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can issue a command to one living creature by expending 1 point of mental focus. This functions as <i>command</i>. The target must be within 30 feet and capable of understanding your order. The target can attempt a Will save to negate this effect. If the creature is the same creature type as you, it takes a -2 penalty on this saving throw.</p><h1>Evocation Implements</h1><p>Implements focused on evocation grant the ability to create and direct energy to protect and to destroy.</p><p><b>Implements</b>: Gloves, rod, staff, wand.</p><p><b>Resonant Powers</b>: Each time the occultist invests mental focus into an evocation implement, the implement grants the following resonant power. The implement's bearer gains the benefits of this power until the occultist refreshes his focus.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><i>Intense Focus (Su)</i>: The implement channels and enhances the effects of damaging evocations. A spellcaster who bears the implement can add the implement as an additional focus component for any of his damaging evocation spells that have an instantaneous duration or focus powers with an instantaneous duration. If he does so, the spell or focus power deals 1 additional point of damage of the same type to each creature for every 2 points of mental focus invested in the implement, to a maximum of 1 + 1 for every 2 occultist levels you possess.</p><p><b>Base Focus Power</b>: All occultists who learn to use evocation implements gain the following focus power.</p><p><i>Energy Ray (Sp)</i>: As a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to unleash a ray of pure energy as a ranged touch attack. This ray has a range of 30 feet. The ray deals an amount of energy damage equal to 1d6 points + 1d6 points for every 2 occultist levels you possess beyond 1st (2d6 at 3rd level, 3d6 at 5th, and so on, to a maximum of 10d6 at 19th level). When you unleash an energy ray, you must decide what type of damage it deals (acid, cold, electricity, or fire).</p><p><b>Focus Powers</b>: In addition to gaining the base focus power, occultists who learn to use evocation implements can select from the following focus powers when choosing the powers gained from their focus powers class feature.</p><p><i>Energy Blast (Sp)</i>: As a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you can expend 2 points of mental focus to unleash a blast of energy. This blast has a range of 100 feet, and deals 5d6 points of energy damage, plus an additional 1d6 points for every 2 occultist levels you possess beyond 5th (6d6 at 7th, 7d6 at 9th, and so on, to a maximum of 12d6 at 19th level). The blast deals damage to each creature in a 20-foot-radius burst, but each affected creature can attempt a Reflex save to halve the damage. When you unleash an energy blast, you must decide what type of damage it deals (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). You must be at least 5th level to select this focus power.</p><p><i>Energy Ward (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to surround yourself in a swirling ward of energy. When you activate this power, you must select acid, cold, electricity, or fire. You gain resistance 10 against that energy type, and whenever a creature hits you with a melee weapon or natural weapon, that creature takes 1d6 points of energy damage of the chosen type. Attacks made with melee weapons with reach don't cause the attacker to take this damage. At 13th and 19th levels, the resistance granted by this ward increases by 5, to a maximum of resistance 20 at 19th level. The energy ward lasts for 1 round per occultist level. You must be at least 7th level to select this focus power.</p><p><i>Light Matrix (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to create a glowing orb of swirling lights that obeys your commands. This orb illuminates the area like the <i>light </i>spell. The orb can be commanded to hover over your shoulder, moving with you. As a move action, you can direct it to move up to 30 feet away from you. If the light matrix is ever more than 30 feet away from you, it returns to hover over your shoulder. If you are at least 5th level, you can direct the light matrix to make a melee touch attack against one foe within 30 feet. If the attack hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds by a flash of light. If the attack hits, regardless of whether the target succeeds at the save, the light matrix immediately ends. The light matrix otherwise has a duration of 1 hour per occultist level you possess. You can't have more than one light matrix in existence at one time. If you use this power again, any previous light matrices immediately end.</p><p><i>Radiance (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can touch a weapon to cause it to glow with light by expending 1 point of mental focus. The weapon produces light like a torch. For the purpose of darkness spells and abilities, this effect counts as a light spell of level 0, plus 1 additional spell level for every 2 occultist levels you possess. This light lasts for 1 minute per occultist level you possess. In addition, whenever the weapon scores a critical hit against a foe, the wielder can choose to end the effect, causing the foe to be surrounded by the radiance for 1d4 rounds. While illuminated in this way, the target can't benefit from concealment or invisibility, nor can it attempt Stealth checks to avoid being seen. All attack rolls made against an illuminated foe receive a +2 circumstance bonus.</p><p><i>Shape Mastery (Su)</i>: As part of casting an evocation spell with an area of effect, you can expend a number of points of mental focus up to your Intelligence modifier to exclude an equal number of squares from the area.</p><p><i>Wall of Power (Sp)</i>: By expending 1 point of mental focus as a standard action, you can create a wall of pure energy with a length of up to 5 feet per occultist level you possess. This wall is 10 feet high and 1 foot thick. It doesn't block passage, line of sight, or line of effect, but does deal damage to anyone passing through it. The wall deals 2d6 points of energy damage + 1 point of energy damage per occultist level you possess. You must select acid, cold, electricity, or fire when you create the wall to determine the type of damage it deals. The wall must be straight, and can't pass through a creature's space when created. The wall lasts for 1 round per occultist level you possess. You must be at least 9th level to select this focus power.</p><h1>Illusion Implements</h1><p>Illusion implements allow the occultist to distort the senses and cloak creatures from sight.</p><p><b>Implements</b>: Crystal, hat, mask, prism, ring.</p><p><b>Resonant Powers</b>: Each time the occultist invests mental focus into an illusion implement, the implement grants the following resonant power. The implement's bearer gains the benefits of this power until the occultist refreshes his focus.</p><p><i>Distortion (Sp)</i>: The implement allows its bearer to distort his form and location, protecting him from harm. As a standard action, the bearer can gain a concealment miss chance equal to 5% for every point of mental focus invested in the implement (to a maximum of 5% + 5% for every 2 occultist levels you possess) until the next time the bearer makes an attack. If this miss chance reaches 50%, it doesn't increase further, but the bearer gains all the benefits of <i>invisibility</i>. Creatures with <i>see invisibility</i>, <i>true seeing</i>, or similar abilities ignore the miss chance from this ability.</p><p><b>Base Focus Power</b>: All occultists who learn to use illusion implements gain the following focus power.</p><p><i>Minor Figment (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to create a minor figment. This can function as either <i>ghost sound </i>or <i>minor image</i>. In either case, the effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your occultist level. If you are 7th level or higher, the figment lasts for a number of minutes equal to your occultist level, and you can cause the figment to change once during its duration when a specified condition occurs.</p><p><b>Focus Powers</b>: In addition to gaining the base focus power, occultists who learn to use illusion implements can select from the following focus powers when choosing the powers gained from their focus powers class feature.</p><p><i>Cloak Image (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to hide your appearance behind an illusion, as <i>disguise self</i>. The effect lasts for 1 minute per occultist level you possess. At 5th level, you can instead expend 2 points of mental focus to appear as a creature of a different type, but you must remain the same size. At 7th level, you can expend 1 additional point of mental focus to target a willing creature other than yourself with this ability.</p><p><i>Color Beam (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to unleash a beam of cascading colors at any one target within 30 feet. Doing so requires a ranged touch attack. If the beam hits, the target is blinded for 1 round if it has a number of Hit Dice equal to or lower than your occultist level. A foe with a number of Hit Dice greater than your occultist level is instead dazzled for 1 round. The foe can attempt a Will save to negate the effect. Regardless of whether it succeeds at its save, the target is then immune to this effect for 1 day. This is a mind-affecting illusion effect.</p><p><i>Masquerade (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to take on the appearance of another creature that you touch. If the creature is not friendly to you, this requires a melee touch attack, but the target doesn't receive a saving throw to negate the effect. You gain a circumstance bonus on Disguise checks equal to your occultist level + 10, but only to look like the creature touched. This bonus doesn't stack with the bonuses from polymorph spells or spells like <i>disguise self</i>. While using this ability, you can change your disguise as a standard action by touching a different creature and assuming its appearance. You can end this effect at any time. This effect lasts for 10 minutes per occultist level you possess, but you can renew the duration at any time by expending 1 additional point of mental focus. You must be at least 7th level to select this focus power.</p><p><i>Mirage (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to cloak an area in illusion, allowing you to change the area's appearance. You can affect up to one 5-foot-cube area for every occultist level you possess, changing the appearance in a way that seems natural to the surroundings, subject to GM discretion. You could, for example, hide a door or passageway, make a table appear to be covered in food, or even create the illusion of a pit. You can't make creatures or objects invisible with this power, but you can change the appearance of an object or create an illusion for creatures to hide behind. This functions as <i>major image</i>, and creatures that physically interact with the illusion in any way can attempt a Will save to see through the mirage. You must be at least 5th level to select this focus power.</p><p><i>Shadow Beast (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can call forth one or more beasts made of shadow by expending 1 point of mental focus. This functions as <i>shadow conjuration</i>, but it can be used to duplicate only the effects of <i>summon monster </i>spells. Creatures created with this spell deal 50% of the normal damage to those that disbelieve the illusion, and their nondamaging effects have only a 50% chance of affecting disbelieving targets. This can be used to duplicate any <i>summon monster </i>spell up to <i>summon monster V</i>. For every 2 additional levels you possess beyond 9th, the maximum spell level you can duplicate with this ability increases by 1 (to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX </i>at 17th level). Regardless of the spell duplicated, the creatures remain for 1 round per occultist level you possess. You must be at least 9th level to select this focus power.</p><p><i>Unseen (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to become invisible, as <i>invisibility</i>. This effect lasts for 1 minute per occultist level you possess. You can expend 2 points of mental focus instead of 1 to use this power on a willing adjacent creature instead of yourself. You can still see creatures you make invisible with this power. If the invisible creature makes an attack or otherwise takes an action that would cause the invisibility to end, you can immediately expend 1 additional point of mental focus to allow the creature to remain invisible if the creature is within 30 feet of you. You must be at least 3rd level to select this focus power.</p><h1>Necromancy Implements</h1><p>Implements that draw power from necromancy can control undead and harm the living.</p><p><b>Implements</b>: Bone, coin, doll, drum, robe, skull.</p><p><b>Resonant Powers</b>: Each time the occultist invests mental focus into a necromancy implement, the implement grants the following resonant power. The implement's bearer gains the benefits of this power until the occultist refreshes his focus.</p><p><i>Necromantic Focus (Su)</i>: The implement grants its possessor greater power over the undead. Whoever possesses the implement can control an additional 2 Hit Dice of undead for every point of mental focus invested in the item (to a maximum number of Hit Dice equal to 4 x your occultist level). Any spellcaster who bears the implement can add it as an additional focus component for a necromancy spell he casts to create undead. If he does so, he can create an additional number of HD of undead equal to the additional HD the implement allows him to control (apply this effect after doubling the HD of undead for <i>desecrate</i>, if applicable). Undead creatures take a -1 penalty on saving throws against spells cast by the bearer of this implement for every 4 points of mental focus invested in this implement.</p><p><b>Base Focus Power</b>: All occultists who learn to use necromancy implements gain the following focus power.</p><p><i>Mind Fear (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to cause a living creature to succumb to fear. The target must be within 30 feet of you, and it can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect. If the target fails the save and has a number of Hit Dice less than or equal to yours, it is frightened for 1d4 rounds. If the target fails the saving throw and has a number of Hit Dice greater than yours, it is instead shaken for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p><p><b>Focus Powers</b>: In addition to gaining the base focus power, occultists who learn to use necromancy implements can select from the following focus powers when choosing the powers gained from their focus powers class feature.</p><p><i>Flesh Rot (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack and expend 1 point of mental focus to cause the flesh of a living creature to rot and wither. If the attack hits, the target takes 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per occultist level you possess. For every 4 occultist levels you possess beyond 3rd, the target takes an additional 1d8 points of damage (to a maximum of 5d8 at 19th level). If you miss with the melee touch attack, this power is wasted with no effect. You must be at least 3rd level to select this focus power.</p><p><i>Necromantic Servant (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to raise a single human skeleton (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>250) or human zombie (<i>Bestiary </i>288) from the ground to serve you for 10 minutes per occultist level you possess or until it is destroyed, whichever comes first. This servant has a number of hit points equal to 1/2 your maximum hit point total (not adjusted for temporary hit points or other temporary increases). It also uses your base attack bonus and gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to 1/2 your occultist level. At 5th level, whenever the necromantic servant would be destroyed, if you are within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) of the servant, you can expend 1 point of mental focus as an immediate action to cause the servant to return to full hit points. At 9th level, you can choose to give the servant the bloody or burning simple template (if it's a skeleton) or the fast simple template (if it's a zombie). At 13th level, when you take an immediate action to restore your servant, it splits into two servants. You can have a maximum number of servants in existence equal to 1/2 your occultist level. At 17th level, the servant gains a teamwork feat of your choice.</p><p><i>Pain Wave (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to unleash a wave of pain. This wave hits all creatures other than you in a 20-foot-radius burst centered on a point that you designate within 100 feet. All living creatures in this area are wracked with pain, gaining the sickened condition for 1 round per occultist level you possess. Affected creatures can attempt a Will save to reduce the duration to just 1 round. This is a mind-affecting pain(UM) effect. You must be at least 7th level to select this focus power.</p><p><i>Psychic Curse (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to curse a living creature within 30 feet with your psychic magic. You can choose one of the following effects: memory lapse, mental block, or pain confusion. If you choose memory lapse, the target loses its memory of the past 1 hour per occultist level you possess. If you choose mental block, you can proscribe one specific action, such as attacking with a type of weapon, casting a specific spell, or something else suitably specific (subject to the GM's discretion). The target can't take that action without first succeeding at a Will save. If it fails, it can take other actions instead. If it attempts the prohibited action again on subsequent rounds, it gains a cumulative +2 bonus on the save until it succeeds. If you select pain confusion, the creature is confused for 1d4 rounds whenever it is damaged by a critical hit. The target can attempt a Will save to negate this effect. This effect lasts for 1 day per occultist level you possess. A creature can't be under the effects of more than one psychic curse at a time. This is a mind-affecting curse(UM) effect. You must be at least 5th level to select this focus power.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><i>Soulbound Puppet (Su)</i>: As a full-round action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to create a soulbound puppet from a bone, doll, or skull. If you use a bone or a skull, your power builds a Tiny or Small flesh puppet around it that vaguely resembles the original creature from which the bones were taken. If the implement is a doll, the doll comes to life. Treat this as a familiar, using your occultist level as your wizard level to determine its powers and abilities. By using a bone or skull from the appropriate creature or a doll shaped like that creature, you can select any of the familiar choices available to a wizard. You can instead use a humanoid bone, doll, or skull, to give the puppet the base statistics of a homunculus (<i>Bestiary </i>176), but without a fly speed or the poison bite or telepathic link abilities. No matter the form, this creature is a construct with an alignment matching your own. You can have no more than one soulbound puppet active at any given time. The soulbound puppet remains animated for 10 minutes per occultist level you possess.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><i>Spirit Shroud (Su)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to surround yourself with a shroud of spirit energy. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your occultist level. This shroud lasts for 1 minute per occultist level or until the temporary hit points are expended, whichever comes first. These temporary hit points stack with those from other sources, but not with those gained through multiple uses of this ability. At 4th level, as long as the shroud remains, you also gain a resistance bonus on all saving throws against death effects, fear effects, and any spells or effects that bestow negative levels or deal negative energy damage (if the spells or effects allow a save). This bonus is equal to 1 + 1 for every 4 occultist levels you possess beyond 4th. You must be at least 3rd level to select this focus power.</p><h1>Transmutation Implements</h1><p>Transmutation implements can alter the properties of both objects and creatures.</p><p><b>Implements</b>: Belt, boots, sandals, vest, weapon.</p><p><b>Resonant Powers</b>: Each time the occultist invests mental focus into a transmutation implement, the implement grants the following resonant power. The implement's bearer gains the benefits of this power until the occultist refreshes his focus.</p><p><i>Physical Enhancement (Su)</i>: The implement enhances its bearer's body. When you invest mental focus in the implement, select a physical ability score. The implement grants a +2 temporary enhancement bonus to that physical ability score for every 3 points of mental focus invested in the implement (to a maximum of +2 at 1st level, plus an additional 2 for every 6 occultist levels you possess).</p><p><b>Base Focus Power</b>: All occultists who learn to use transmutation implements gain the following focus power.</p><p><i>Legacy Weapon (Su)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus and touch a weapon to grant it an enhancement bonus. The bonus is equal to 1 + 1 for every 6 occultist levels you possess (to a maximum of +4 at 18th level). Enhancement bonuses gained by this ability stack with those of the weapon, to a maximum of +5. You can also imbue the weapon with any one weapon special ability with an equivalent enhancement bonus less than or equal to your maximum bonus by reducing the granted enhancement bonus by the appropriate amount. The item must have an enhancement bonus of at least +1 (from the item itself or from legacy weapon) to gain a weapon special ability. In either case, these bonuses last for 1 minute.</p><p><b>Focus Powers</b>: In addition to gaining the base focus power, occultists who learn to use transmutation implements can select from the following focus powers when choosing the powers gained from their focus powers class feature.</p><p><i>Mind Over Gravity (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to give yourself a fly speed of 60 feet with perfect maneuverability. This effect lasts for 1 minute per occultist level you possess. You must be at least 7th level to select this focus power.</p><p><i>Philosopher's Touch (Su)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus and touch a weapon, causing it to gain the properties of a special material. You can cause the weapon to be treated as cold iron or silver for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction for 1 minute per occultist level you possess. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you can touch an additional weapon as part of using this ability to grant that weapon the same benefit (still expending only 1 point of mental focus). At 11th level, you can cause any weapon affected by this ability to act as if it were adamantine instead (but only for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction, not for overcoming hardness).</p><p><i>Quickness (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to grant supernatural quickness and Reflexes to yourself or a willing living creature you touch.</p><p>This functions as <i>haste</i>, but the bonus to AC and on Reflex saving throws increases to +2. This effect lasts for 1 round per occultist level you possess. You must be at least 5th level to select this focus power.</p><p><i>Size Alteration (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus and touch a creature to alter its size. You can increase or decrease the creature's size by one step, as <i>enlarge person </i>or <i>reduce person </i>but not limited by the creature's type. If the creature is hostile toward you, using this ability requires a successful melee touch attack, and the creature can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the effect. This effect lasts for 1 round per occultist level you possess. You can't use this ability on a creature that is already subject to an effect that alters its size.</p><p><i>Sudden Speed (Sp)</i>: As a swift action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to grant yourself a burst of speed. This increases your land speed by 30 feet for 1 minute. This ability does not stack with itself.</p><p><i>Telekinetic Mastery (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to grant yourself telekinetic power. This functions as <i>telekinesis</i>, except you don't need to concentrate on the effect to maintain it, and using any one of its effects is a standard action. This effect lasts for 1 round per occultist level you possess. You must be at least 9th level to select this focus power.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1occultclasses\">^Occult Classes</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypes\">Archetypes</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"HnZYCrhVIKrSsLWA"}

All of her infusions granted by this archetype work only on targets with blood and automatically fail if the target is immune to bleed damage.</p><p><b>Wrack (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a blood kineticist can use her abilities to wrack a target within 30 feet, harming the target by manipulating its blood from the inside. The target takes half the normal damage of the blood kineticist's blast, and can attempt a Fortitude save to reduce that amount to 1/4 normal damage, but the damage is untyped and ignores damage reduction. This is a 1st-level form infusion that costs 0 points of burn and can be used with water and blood blasts. This ability replaces the 1st-level infusion.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Bleeding Infusion (Su)</b>: At 5th level, a blood kineticist can infuse her blasts with a vicious power that causes internal or external bleeding. On a failed Fortitude save, the target takes 1 point of bleed damage for every die of the blast's damage. A target that fails its saving throw against the wrack form infusion does not receive a saving throw to avoid the bleed damage from bleeding infusion on the same blast. This is a 2nd-level substance infusion that costs 2 points of burn and can be used with water and blood blasts. This ability replaces the 5th-level infusion.</p><p><b>Blood Tell (Sp)</b>: At 6th level, a blood kineticist's connection to blood allows her to learn much from the blood of another. This works as <i>blood biography</i>(APG), except the blood kineticist suddenly knows the information, rather than having it appear on a parchment. This is a 3rd-level utility wild talent and costs 0 points of burn. She can accept 1 point of burn to reduce the casting time to a standard action instead of 1 minute. This ability replaces the 6th-level utility wild talent.</p><p><b>Blood Blast (Su)</b>: The first time a blood kineticist selects water with expanded element, she doesn't gain the cold simple blast or the ice composite blast; instead, she gains the blood composite blast, which costs 2 points of burn. A blood blast is a physical blast that deals bludgeoning damage. It is associated with the same infusions as the water blast. If the blood kineticist selects water with expanded element a second time, she gains the cold simple blast and ice composite blast as normal. This ability alters expanded element.</p><p><b>Blood Throw (Su)</b>: At 8th level, a blood kineticist gains the foe throw infusion as a bonus infusion, and can use it with the water element on water and blood blasts, in addition to its normal associated element and blast. This ability replaces the 8th-level utility wild talent.</p><p><b>Gut-Wrenching Infusion (Su)</b>: At 9th level, a blood kineticist can infuse her blasts with the ability to manipulate her opponent's insides to the point of impairing their function. On a failed Fortitude save, the target is sickened for 1 minute. A target that fails its saving throw against the wrack form infusion does not receive a saving throw to avoid the sickened condition from gut-wrenching infusion on the same blast. This is a 4th-level substance infusion that costs 3 points of burn and can be used with water and blood blasts. This ability replaces the 9th-level infusion.</p><p><b>Vampiric Infusion (Su)</b>: At 11th level, a blood kineticist can drain the vitality from her enemy's blood to restore her own. If her blast hits (or the enemy fails its saving throw against a blast without an attack roll) the blood kineticist can activate the kinetic healer utility wild talent on herself by accepting its burn cost; she doesn't need to take an action to do so. If she doesn't possess the kinetic healer utility wild talent, she can still use this ability, but it heals only half as much. This is a 5th-level substance infusion that costs 3 points of burn and can be used with water and blood blasts. This ability replaces the 11th-level infusion.</p><p><b>Blood Mastery (Su)</b>: At 20th level, a blood kineticist no longer ages and can't be magically aged. She doesn't take penalties to her ability scores for aging and removes any such penalties she already possesses. She still accrues age bonuses as normal, but she doesn't die of old age when her time would be up. Because of her utter control over her own blood, she is immune to bleed, injected poisons, injury diseases, and the sickened and nauseated conditions unless she chooses to be affected. This ability replaces omnikinesis.</p><h1>ELEMENTAL ANNIHILATOR (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>For some kineticists, nothing in life is as sweet as destruction and pain. Elemental annihilators pursue only uses of their powers that harm others.</p><p><b>Devastating Infusion (Su)</b>: At 1st level, an elemental annihilator can either shoot her kinetic blast at a target within 30 feet or make a single melee attack as if she were using kinetic blade as an attack action. For this attack, the elemental annihilator's base attack bonus from her kineticist levels is equal to her full kineticist level. A devastating infusion always deals an amount of damage equal to 1d8 + the elemental annihilator's Constitution modifier, regardless of the annihilator's class level or use of composite blasts. When making a melee attack with devastating infusion, the elemental annihilator doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, and if she uses two hands, the attack's damage is equal to 1d8 + 1-1/2 times her Constitution modifier. This is a 1st-level form infusion that costs 0 points of burn and can be used with any physical blast (but not energy blasts). Unlike with kinetic blade, the elemental annihilator can use Vital Strike with devastating infusion. The damage bonus from elemental overflow doesn't apply to devastating infusion's damage rolls. This ability replaces the 1st-level infusion and the basic utility wild talent normally granted by selecting an element.</p><p><b>Dampened Versatility (Ex)</b>: An elemental annihilator can never gain utility wild talents.</p><p><b>Bonus Feats</b>: At 2nd level, an elemental annihilator can select a bonus feat from the following list: Deadly Aim, Double Slice, Point-Blank Shot, Power Attack, Precise Shot, Rapid Shot, Two- Weapon Fighting, Weapon Finesse, and Weapon Focus. Rapid Shot and Two-Weapon Fighting can be used with a kinetic blast only if the annihilator also possesses flurry of devastation (see below). She gains an additional bonus feat at 8th, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels. At 8th level, she can also select Improved Two-Weapon Fighting and Weapon Specialization. At 10th level, she can also select Greater Weapon Focus, Improved Critical, Improved Precise Shot, and Two-Weapon Rend. An elemental annihilator doesn't need to meet the prerequisites for these feats to select them as bonus feats. This ability replaces the 2nd-, 8th-, 10th-, 14th-, and 18th-level utility wild talents.</p><p><b>Increased Range (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, an elemental annihilator gains the extended range infusion. At 9th level, she gains the extreme range infusion. This ability replaces the 3rd- and 9th-level infusions.</p><p><b>Ever-Present Threat (Su)</b>: At 4th level, an elemental annihilator threatens all foes within her natural reach. If anyone provokes an attack of opportunity from her, she can form her melee devastating infusion and make the attack, after which the weapon disappears. This ability replaces the 4th-level utility wild talent.</p><p><b>Blast Training (Ex)</b>: At 5th level, an elemental annihilator gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with her devastating infusion form infusion. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter. This ability replaces the 5th-level infusion.</p><p><b>Flurry of Devastation (Su)</b>: At 6th level, an elemental annihilator can make a full attack of devastating infusions against targets within 120 feet as a full-attack action. Each individual attack deals damage as a devastating infusion. This is a 3rd-level form infusion that costs 1 point of burn and can be used with the same blast types as devastating infusion. Abilities such as Rapid Shot and <i>haste </i>that grant additional attacks apply normally to this full attack. If she makes only melee attacks with her flurry of devastation, she can use the Two-Weapon Fighting feats (unlike with the kinetic blade wild talent), but ranged devastating infusions do not work with Two-Weapon Fighting. For the elemental annihilator's off-hand attacks with Two-Weapon Fighting, she adds half her Constitution modifier to the damage (increasing to her full Constitution modifier if she has Double Slice). Though she can normally mix melee and ranged attacks with her flurry of devastation, she can't do so when she uses Two-Weapon Fighting. She can never use metakinesis or substance infusions with flurry of devastation. This ability replaces the 6th-, 12th-, and 16th-level utility wild talents.</p><p><b>Omnicide (Su)</b>: At 20th level, an elemental annihilator can unleash omnicide, a unique physical composite blast. Omnicide deals 10d6+10 points of bludgeoning damage, 10d6+10 points of cold damage, 10d6+10 points of electricity damage, 10d6+10 points of fire damage, and 10d6+10 points of force damage, and counts as a blast of all five elements. Omnicide costs 4 points of burn, which can be reduced by composite specialization as normal. This ability replaces omnikinesis and the 20th-level utility wild talent.</p><h1>ELEMENTAL ASCETIC (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Combining the elemental powers of a kineticist with the rigid physical discipline of a monk, an elemental ascetic channels his powers through his body to enhance himself in combat.</p><p><b>Elemental Flurry (Su)</b>: At 1st level, an elemental ascetic gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. He gains the kinetic fist form infusion and it costs 0 points of burn instead of 1 point of burn. When using the kinetic fist form infusion with a full attack, he can make a flurry of blows as the monk class feature. He must use only his fists to make this flurry, no matter what other abilities he possesses. Like a monk, he can use this ability only when unarmored, not using a shield, and unencumbered. He can't use his kinetic blast without a form infusion, nor can he ever use his kinetic blast with the chain, extended range, extreme range, foe throw, flurry of blasts, many throw, or snake form infusions, or with any other form infusion that requires a ranged attack roll or ranged touch attack roll. This ability alters kinetic blast and replaces elemental overflow.</p><p><b>Elemental Wisdom (Su)</b>: An elemental ascetic can use his Wisdom modifier instead of his Constitution modifier to determine the DCs of Constitution-based wild talents, the duration of wild talents with a Constitution-based duration, and his bonus on concentration checks for wild talents. This ability alters the key ability scores of wild talents.</p><p><b>AC Bonus (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, when unarmored, not using a shield, and unencumbered, an elemental ascetic adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC and his CMD. These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the elemental ascetic is flat-footed. He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 kineticist levels the elemental ascetic possesses beyond 2nd. The elemental ascetic's kineticist levels stack with monk levels for the purpose of determining when the bonus increases. An elemental ascetic can never take the expanded defense utility wild talent. This ability replaces elemental defense.</p><p><b>Powerful Fist (Su)</b>: At 5th level, an elemental ascetic can accept 2 additional points of burn when using kinetic fist to increase that infusion's damage dice from d6s to d8s. At 9th level, he can instead accept 3 additional points of burn to increase the damage dice from d6s to d10s. At 13th level, he can instead accept 4 additional points of burn to increase the damage dice from d6s to d12s. All of these options count as burn from a form infusion and can thus be reduced by infusion specialization. This ability replaces the 5th-, 9th-, and 13th-level infusions.</p><h1>KINETIC CHIRURGEON (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>While any hydrokineticist or telekineticist can learn the rudiments of healing, some kineticists are virtuosos of the curative arts.</p><p><b>Kinetic Chirurgery (Su)</b>: A kinetic chirurgeon must select either aether or water as her primary element. She gains kinetic healer as a bonus wild talent at 1st level. At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the kinetic chirurgeon can select any one paladin mercy that a paladin of that level could select. Each time she uses kinetic healer, she can apply one of these mercies to the target of the healing. A kinetic chirurgeon can never use infusions. This ability replaces infusions.</p><p><b>Metahealer (Su)</b>: Starting at 5th level, a kinetic chirurgeon can apply any one of the following metahealer abilities to her kinetic healer wild talent instead of using her mercies. At 5th level, she can choose to roll one additional die when using kinetic healer. This increases to two additional dice at 11th level, and to three additional dice at 17th level. At 9th level, she can choose to bring an ally who died within 1 round back from the dead; this functions similarly to the <i>breath of life </i>spell. The ally regains the normal number of hit points from kinetic healer. An ally revived in this way takes 1 additional point of burn, beyond the normal 1 point of burn that either the kinetic chirurgeon or the ally must accept as a cost of the kinetic healer wild talent. At 13th level, a kinetic chirurgeon can choose to use kinetic healer on herself as a swift action. At 17th level, she can choose to heal both herself and another target with the same use of kinetic healer, although in that case, both she and her target must each accept 1 point of burn, instead of only one of them needing to do so as normal for kinetic healer. Regardless of her level, the kinetic chirurgeon can apply only one metahealer ability to a single use of kinetic healer. For instance, she could not bring back a dead ally and also roll extra dice for healing. This ability replaces metakinesis and infusion specialization.</p><p><b>Healing Buffer (Su)</b>: At 6th level, a kinetic chirurgeon's internal buffer has double the usual maximum size, and she can use it only when she would accept points of burn for the kinetic healer wild talent. This ability alters internal buffer.</p><h1>OVERWHELMING SOUL (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Some kineticists have such a powerful personality that they can seize control of their element with their minds alone, without endangering their bodies.</p><p><b>Mind Over Matter (Ex)</b>: An overwhelming soul uses her Charisma modifier instead of her Constitution modifier to determine her damage with wild talents, the DCs of Constitution-based wild talents, the duration of wild talents with a Constitution-based duration, her bonus on concentration checks for wild talents, and the other Constitution-based effects of all her wild talents. She adds Bluff and Diplomacy to her list of kineticist class skills. This ability alters the kineticist's class skills and the key ability score of wild talents.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Mental Prowess (Su)</b>: An overwhelming soul's mind is strong enough to protect her body from the stress of channeling the elements. However, in exchange, she is unable to push her limits quite as far as other kineticists. She can't choose to accept burn, though she can use wild talents with a burn cost if she can reduce that cost to 0 points with abilities such as gather power and infusion specialization. If she would be forced to accept burn against her will (for example, if she fails a concentration check), instead of taking burn she takes 1 temporary negative level, which never kills her and can't be removed with <i>restoration </i>or <i>greater restoration</i>, but which disappears automatically after 24 hours. At 6th level, once per day, she can reduce the total burn cost of any wild talent by 1. She can use this ability an additional time per day at 10th level and every 4 levels thereafter. This ability alters burn and replaces internal buffer.</p><p><b>Overwhelming Power (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, an overwhelming soul gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with her kinetic blasts. The damage bonus doesn't apply to kinetic blade, kinetic whip, or other infusions that don't apply the damage bonus from elemental overflow. This bonus increases by 1 at 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter. This ability replaces elemental overflow.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypes\">^Archetypes</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"K1L3V9q69dQubSZk"}

           <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>CLASS FEATURES</h1><p>The following are the class features of the medium.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: Mediums are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, and medium armor, but not with shields.</p><p><b>Spells</b>: A medium can cast a small number of psychic spells drawn from the medium spell list (see page 37). To learn or cast a spell, a medium must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell's level. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a medium's spell is equal to 10 + the spell level + the medium's Charisma modifier.</p><p>A medium can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-2: Medium. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 on page 17 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>).</p><p>The medium's selection of spells is limited. At 1st level, a medium knows two 0-level spells of his choice. At each new level, the medium learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-3: Medium Spells Known. Unlike his spells per day, the number of spells a medium knows is not affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1-3 are fixed. At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a medium can learn a single new spell in place of one he already knows. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and he must choose whether to swap the spell at the same time he gains new spells known for the level.</p><p><b>Knacks</b>: Mediums learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-3. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they don't consume slots and can be used again.</p><p><b>Spirit (Su)</b>: A medium serves as a vessel to channel spirits-astral echoes of powerful souls from ages past that live on in myth and legend. Each day, a medium can channel a spirit through a ritual known as a seance. Seances take 1 hour to perform and require the medium's concentration. At the end of a seance, the medium invites a local spirit to inhabit him and serve as his spirit for that day. Each spirit arises from one of six legends, which are described further beginning on page 33. Though the medium can choose the legend to which the spirit he channels belongs, he must channel that spirit from an appropriate location. Each spirit has a favored location it usually inhabits, though spirits may also be present at other locations appropriate to their legends; such locations are listed in each legend's Favored Locations entry. The medium gains the spirit's listed seance boon and lesser spirit power for 24 hours. The medium also gains the spirit's intermediate spirit power at 6th level, its greater spirit power at 11th level, and its supreme spirit power at 17th level. After 24 hours, the medium loses contact with the channeled spirit and can perform another seance.</p><p>A medium can invite his allies to participate in his seance-shared seance (see page 31) and certain spirit powers affect other participants. A character counts as participating so long as she maintains physical contact with another participating character and willfully opens herself to the spirit; unlike the medium, other participating characters can take other actions during this time. Only creatures with an Intelligence score of at least 3 can participate in a seance.</p><p>In addition to granting power to the medium, a channeled spirit can influence the medium. By channeling a spirit, the medium allows the spirit to gain 1 point of influence over him. If the medium loses that 1 point of influence, he loses contact with the spirit, though he is still unable to perform a new seance until the normal 24 hour period has elapsed since his last seance. When the spirit leaves after the 24-hour duration and before the next seance, the spirit's influence over the medium resets to 0. Certain abilities allow the medium to gain additional power in exchange for allowing the spirit more influence over him.</p><p>When a spirit gains at least 3 points of influence over the medium, the dual impulses housed within the same body cause the medium to meld with his spirit's consciousness. The resulting muddled sense of self and struggle for control causes the medium to take a -2 penalty on initiative checks as well as a specific additional penalty listed in each spirit's entry. However, the spirit's mental presence grants the medium a +4 bonus against possession effects and a +2 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects that are not related to possession.</p><p>If a spirit ever attains 5 or more points of influence over the medium, the medium completely loses control to the spirit. He effectively becomes an NPC under the GM's control until after he awakens the next day with the spirit gone.</p><p>During his seance, the medium can choose to channel a weaker spirit to gain its help without incurring as much of its influence. If he does so, he can forgo any number of spirit powers, starting with his most powerful spirit power. For each spirit power he forgoes, the medium can use his spirit surge ability twice without incurring influence.</p><p><b>Spirit Bonus (Su)</b>: When a medium channels a spirit, he gains a bonus on certain checks and to certain statistics, depending on the spirit. A 1st-level medium's spirit bonus is +1; it increases by 1 at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p><p><b>Spirit Surge (Su)</b>: After failing a d20 roll that was modified by his spirit bonus, a medium can allow his spirit to gain 1 additional point of influence over him in order to add 1d6 to the check's result without taking an action. This can cause the check to succeed instead of fail. The medium must be conscious and aware to use this ability, and he can use this ability at most once per round. At 10th level, the medium's spirit surge die increases to 1d8, and at 20th level it increases to 1d10.</p><p><b>Shared Seance (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, a medium can share his channeled spirit's aid with his allies. All allies who participate in the medium's seance gain the channeled spirit's seance boon for 24 hours.</p><p><b>Taboo (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, during his daily seance, a medium can accept a taboo in order to appease his spirit. Each spirit lists example taboos, and the GM may allow additional taboos as well. Accepting a taboo allows the medium to use his spirit surge ability twice without incurring influence. The medium can select only a single taboo. The medium is not magically prevented from breaking his taboo, but if he breaks the taboo for any reason, he takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws for 1 hour and his spirit gains 1 point of influence over him. If the medium continues violating the taboo while taking the penalty, the duration of the penalty extends, but the spirit doesn't gain additional influence over the medium. If a spirit attains 5 points of influence because of a violated taboo, instead of possessing the medium, the spirit leaves the medium's body entirely, and the medium loses access to his spirit powers, spirit bonus, and spirit surge abilities until the next time he can perform a seance. Banishing a spirit in this way damages the medium's connection to that spirit's legend; the medium cannot channel spirits of that legend for 1 week, and the next time the medium channels a spirit of that legend, it starts with 2 points of influence over him instead of 1.</p><p><b>Haunt Channeler (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, a medium can use his familiarity with spirits to assist him when dealing with haunts. He can always act on the surprise round against a haunt, and his touch funnels a portion of the haunt into himself, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the haunt per 2 medium levels he possesses as if via positive energy and allowing the medium to ask the haunt a single question. The haunt can answer the question however it chooses. Additionally, the medium can forgo his saving throw against a haunt's effects to funnel the haunt entirely into himself. If he does so, the medium suffers the haunt's full effect, but the haunt doesn't affect anyone else (even if it normally would). The haunt then gains control of the medium's body for 24 hours. Once per minute, the medium can attempt to end this possession early by succeeding at a Will save (DC = 20 + 1/2 the medium's class level).</p><p><b>Location Channel (Sp)</b>: At 5th level, a medium can perform a special seance at the site of a person's death-or a location that was precious to that person in life-to call forth that person's spirit into the medium's body so his allies can ask it questions. The effects are similar to the spell <i>call spirit </i>(see page 160), except that the duration is 1 round per medium level and the spirit possesses the medium's body instead of appearing in a wispy form. The other participants of the seance must ask the questions. Once the medium attempts to call a spirit, he cannot attempt to call the same spirit again for 24 hours. Once per round, the medium can attempt to end the seance early by succeeding at a Will save (DC = 20 + 1/2 the medium's class level).</p><p><b>Connection Channel (Sp)</b>: At 7th level, a medium can use his location channel ability at any location, so long as he possesses some connection to the deceased. If another participant in the seance is more familiar with the deceased than the medium, the medium can substitute that participant's familiarity in place of his own to determine the DC of the <i>call spirit </i>effect.</p><p><b>Propitiation (Su)</b>: At 9th level, a medium has learned hidden techniques and rites that allow him to mollify his channeled spirit once per day, reducing its influence over him by 1 point (to a minimum of 1 point of influence). The details of the propitiation ritual vary based on the individual spirit, but the process always takes around 10 minutes to perform and it never requires any additional cost (such as an offering of wealth or a live sacrifice).</p><p><b>Ask the Spirits (Sp)</b>: At 13th level, a medium can send his consciousness to the Astral Plane any number of times per day to ask the spirits for advice, as if using <i>contact other plane </i>to contact the Astral Plane. The medium automatically succeeds at the Intelligence check to avoid the possible decrease to his Intelligence and Charisma.</p><p><b>Astral Journey (Sp)</b>: At 14th level, a medium can enter a deep coma in order to project himself onto the Astral Plane as <i>astral projection</i>, except he can project only himself, he can't enter other planes, and his projected gear has no magical properties.</p><p><b>Trance of Three (Su)</b>: At 15th level, as a swift action, a medium can allow his spirit to gain 1 point of influence over him in order to allow a portion of a legendary spirit from another legend to enter him for 1 round per level, granting him the intermediate spirit power from another legend. If that power has a limited number of uses per day, the medium must keep track of the remaining uses even after the secondary spirit is gone; if the medium calls the secondary spirit again that day, it can grant the remaining uses of that power. If the medium uses an ability that incurs influence, the medium's primary spirit gains that amount of influence over him, not the secondary spirit. The medium doesn't gain the benefits of his spirit bonus from the secondary spirit. The medium can end the trance of three early as a free action.</p><p><b>Spacious Soul (Su)</b>: At 18th level, a medium's soul is spacious enough to provide a foothold for his fallen allies, if he so chooses. If one of the allies who participated in the medium's seance that day dies within line of effect and line of sight of the medium, the medium can spend an immediate action to accept that ally's spirit within him. Since the ally inhabits the portion of the medium's soul normally reserved for a spirit, this suppresses the medium's spirit, spirit bonus, and spirit surge abilities as long as the medium maintains this ability. The ally's spirit and the medium share the medium's body and can decide each round on the medium's turn which of them will take the medium's actions for that round. If they don't agree on who should act, they attempt opposed Charisma checks to determine who is dominant for the next hour, and the dominant character decides who acts on each round. The ally's spirit has all the spells and limited use abilities (such as uses of channel energy, ki, and panache) that it possessed at the time of death, but it is incapable of regaining any abilities, points, spells, or uses of abilities it expends. When the ally's spirit acts, it uses the ally's base attack bonus, caster level, and special abilities (such as weapon proficiency), but uses the medium's physical ability scores. If the ally returns to life, this ability immediately ends. Otherwise, the medium can maintain this ability indefinitely. The medium can end this effect as a standard action, though if the ally is unwilling to depart, the medium must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the ally's hit dice + the ally's Charisma modifier) or the attempt fails and the ally becomes dominant for 24 hours.</p><p><b>Spirit Mastery (Ex)</b>: At 19th legend, the medium becomes a legend among spirits, particularly lesser spirits. He can use his spirit surge ability an additional two times per day without incurring influence, regardless of whether he accepts a taboo or channels a weaker spirit. When channeling a weaker spirit, he can use his spirit surge ability an additional four times per day for each power he forgoes, instead of an additional two times.</p><p><b>Astral Beacon (Su)</b>: At 20th level, a medium is an open connection to the Astral Plane and a shining beacon for spirits. As a free action, he can channel spirits of any of the five legends he did not contact via his seance. This ability lasts for 1 round and grants access to the intermediate, greater, and supreme spirit powers of the chosen spirits. Unlike trance of three, astral beacon allows spirits of the chosen legends (for instance, archmage) to gain influence over the medium until 24 hours from when the medium contacted his primary spirit. Also unlike trance of three, if the medium would incur influence by using one of the new spirits' abilities, that influence is added to the medium's total influence from that spirit rather than from his primary spirit.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1occultclasses\">^Occult Classes</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypes\">Archetypes</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"K8HX7twQF79tQ3zs"}

The doll feeds off of violent emotion and anger. Each time anger flares or battle rages within 20 feet of the doll, there is a 5% chance the malevolent spirit within the doll awakens, manifesting as an advanced poltergeist <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 </i>2 92, 211). When this happens, the doll becomes incorporeal and floats into the air, the poltergeist's malevolent spirit invisibly surrounding it. The poltergeist's site bond ability is tied to the space it spawned in, and it immediately attacks those around it. When the poltergeist is slain, the doll turns corporeal again and falls to the ground, its spirit quelled for the time being. The spirit within the doll can be questioned using the <i>call spirit</i>* spell.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Owning a <i>haunted doll </i>leads to troubled dreams for the possessor, full of seemingly prophetic warnings of doom. Each night, there is a 10% chance that the owner needs to attempt a DC 20 Will save. On a failure, the owner gains no rest for the night and can't recover spells, pools, or other daily abilities.</p><h1>INTENDED MAGIC ITEM</h1><p><i>anatomy doll</i>(UE), <i>hexing doll</i>(UE), <i>ganji doll*</i></p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>MANIAC HAND</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>SLOT</b> none (replaces hand) <b>CL</b> 13th <b>WEIGHT</b> 2 lbs.</p><p><b>AURA</b> strong necromancy</p><p>This dried and withered hand ends in a jagged stump. When it is touched against the arm stump of a humanoid who has lost a hand, the <i>maniac hand </i>bonds instantly and returns to a lifelike appearance. It shrinks or grows to match the size of its new owner, and transforms itself to match the hand lost, becoming either a right or left hand. After merging, an uneven scar and unhealthy hue identify it as alien to its new owner.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Attacks made with a <i>maniac hand </i>receive a +2 competence bonus on attack and damage rolls. In addition, when making a full attack, the wielder can accept a -2 penalty to AC in order to make one extra attack with the hand using the wielder's full base attack bonus. This benefit is not cumulative with similar effects, such as a <i>haste </i>spell. for the purposes of these bonuses, any weapon held in the <i>maniac hand </i>or in both hands qualifies, and the hand itself can deal damage as a slam attack appropriate to the wielder's size (1d4 for a Medium creature).</p><p>A <i>maniac hand </i>has an insidious will that slowly usurps control from the owner. It has Intelligence 8, Wisdom 12, and Charisma 10. Incapable of communication and bereft of rational thought, a <i>maniac hand </i>knows only an insatiable urge to destroy. When first attached, a <i>maniac hand </i>has an Ego score of 5. At least once each day, when presented with an opportunity to murder a friend or innocent without being witnessed, the <i>maniac hand </i>attempts to assert control using the rules for items against characters (<i>Core Rulebook </i>535). If it succeeds, the hand takes control of its owner until it can commit the murder or 5 minutes pass, whichever comes first. The owner remembers nothing of the crime save a blinding rage, and the hand's Ego score returns to 5. If the hand fails to assert control, the owner feels a momentary surge of anger, but can't identify the source. Each day that passes without the hand's murderous impulse killing a creature of Intelligence 3 or higher, its Ego score increases by 1. If its Ego score increases above 20, the hand no longer cares for caution, and attempts murder regardless of the chance of getting caught.</p><p>A <i>maniac hand </i>that's denied the death of friends or innocents for more than 30 days turns against its owner. If in a position to sabotage the owner, such as by letting go of a rope, it attempts to assert control. It can assert control while the owner sleeps, strangling its host or seizing a weapon to deliver a coup de grace. The hand attempts such an act at most once per day. An owner willing to slaughter innocents can keep the hand satisfied by finding an innocent victim and voluntarily relinquishing control to the hand.</p><p>If the owner tries to rid herself of the <i>maniac hand </i>by destroying or amputating it, the hand resists to the best of its ability. It makes attacks and one-handed grapple attempts with its owner's own Strength and Dexterity scores, augmented by the hand's bonuses. The hand has an AC equal to its owner's touch AC, except with a +4 size bonus that stacks with its owner's size modifier. Its owner loses her Dexterity bonus against the hand's attacks, but the hand retains its Dexterity bonus against its owner. The hand's hp is equal to 1/4 that of its owner.</p><p>Successfully casting <i>remove curse </i>on a <i>maniac hand </i>prevents it from resisting amputation for 1 hour.</p><h1>INTENDED MAGIC ITEM</h1><p><i>hand of glory</i>, <i>hand of the mage</i>, <i>hand of stone</i>(UE)</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>MIRROR OF SOUL SNARING</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>SLOT</b> none <b>CL</b> 15th <b>WEIGHT</b> 45 lbs.</p><p><b>AURA</b> strong necromancy</p><p>This normal mirror is roughly 4 feet long and 3 feet wide. It is similar to a <i>mirror of opposition </i>or <i>mirror of life trapping</i>, but it lacks a command word. A <i>mirror of soul snaring </i>has 15 extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature coming within 30 feet of the device and looking at its own reflection must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or have its soul sucked into one of the compartments. A creature not aware of the cursed nature of the device always sees its own reflection. The probability of a creature seeing its reflection and thus needing to attempt the saving throw drops to 50% if the creature is aware that the mirror is cursed and seeks to avoid looking at it (treat as a gaze attack).</p><p>When a creature's soul is trapped, its body remains outside of the mirror. The body becomes possessed by a malignant spirit who behaves in a way entirely opposed to how the trapped creature would. Treat this spirit as the creature, with a reversed alignment (and potentially other factors reversed, such as being an antipaladin instead of a paladin). In the case of neutral characters, the spirit can be either chaotic evil or lawful good as decided by the GM. The death of the creature's original body does not free its soul from the mirror, though if it is ever set free, it immediately passes on to the afterlife as it no longer has a body to inhabit.</p><p>If the mirror's capacity is exceeded, one victim's soul (determined randomly) is set free and immediately reconnects with its duplicate body if available.

Members of other classes can take combat feats provided they meet the prerequisites.</p><h1>Metamagic Feats</h1><p>Metamagic feats allow spellcasters to modify and change their spells, granting the spells new powers and effects. Such spells generally take up a higher-level spell slot than the normal spell. For complete rules on how to apply metamagic feats to spells, see page 112 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Stare Feats</h1><p>Stare feats allow a mesmerist to apply additional effects to his painful stare ability. Characters without the Compounded Pain feat can apply the effects of only one stare feat to an individual attack; a mesmerist with multiple stare feats must choose which to apply before the damage roll is made.</p><h1>Teamwork Feats</h1><p>Teamwork feats grant significant bonuses, but they function only under specific circumstances. In most cases, these feats require an ally with the same feat to have a specific position on the battlefield. Teamwork feats provide their benefits only if the given conditions are met. Allies who are paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise unable to act don't count for the purposes of these feats. Cavaliers, hunters, and inquisitors have special class abilities that allow them to use teamwork feats even if their allies don't have those feats.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">^Feats</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter4psychicmagic\">Psychic Magic</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"M9SUT9JOVjE4VPpX"}
{"name":"Psychic Magic","permission":{"default":0,"JgpLZkPryhl1EFab":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_1z51bd5yv01","path":"Pathfinder RPG - Occult Adventures Reference Library#/CF_SEP/Occult Adventures#/CF_SEP/CHAPTER 4: PSYCHIC MAGIC","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\"></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Wizards study ancient tomes to unlock arcane secrets of the universe, and clerics pray to distant deities to grant them divine power. Yet there is a third, more esoteric kind of magic, connected to every creature's composite being, from the conscious mind to the deepest desire, from the life force to the spirit, from the very soul to the cosmic self. This third type of magic is psychic magic.</p><p>A psychic spell largely functions like any other spell. It's another type of magic, similar to arcane or divine magic-in fact, those who use psychic magic are easily mistaken for practitioners of arcane and divine traditions. Metamagic feats and any other rules that alter or trigger from spells can usually be used with psychic spells (though see the Components section below for a few exceptions). Psychic spellcasters aren't affected by effects that target only arcane or divine spellcasters, nor can they use arcane or divine scrolls or other items or feats that state they can be utilized by only arcane or divine spellcasters.</p><h1>COMPONENTS</h1><p>Psychic magic originates from the distinctive qualities of the caster's composite being, rather than through arcane formulae or rote supplication to divine entities. Therefore, psychic spells never have verbal or somatic components, and have only expensive material components. Psychic spells are purely mental actions, and they can be cast even while the caster is pinned or paralyzed. Focus components work the same way with psychic spells as they do with other spells.</p><p>When a spell calls for an expensive material component, a psychic spellcaster can instead use any item with both significant meaning and a value greater than or equal to the spell's component cost. For example, if a spiritualist wanted to cast <i>raise dead </i>to bring her dead husband back from the grave, she could use her 5,000 gp wedding ring as the spell's material component.</p><p>Instead of verbal and somatic components, all psychic spells have components related to the caster's inner being. The two psychic components are called emotion components and thought components. If a spell's components line lists a somatic component, that spell instead requires an emotion component when cast by psychic spellcasters, and if it has a verbal component, it instead requires a thought component when cast by psychic spellcasters. Psychic spells cast by non-psychic arcane and divine casters use any listed somatic and verbal components as normal.</p><p><b>Emotion Components</b>: Emotion components represent a particular emotional state required to cast the spell. A psychic spellcaster marshals her desire in order to focus and release the spell's energy. It is impossible to cast a spell with an emotion component while the spellcaster is under the influence of a non-harmless effect with the emotion or fear descriptors. (The emotion descriptor was originally introduced in <i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic</i>.) Even if the effect's emotion matches the necessary emotion to cast the psychic spell, the spellcaster is not in control of her own desires and animal impulses, which is a necessary part of providing an emotion component.</p><p><b>Thought Components</b>: Thought components represent mental constructs necessary for the spell's function, such as picturing a wolf in vivid detail-down to the saliva dripping from its jaws-in order to cast <i>beast shape </i>to transform into a wolf. Thought components are so mentally demanding that they make interruptions and distractions extremely challenging. The DC for any concentration check for a spell with a thought component increases by 10. A psychic spellcaster casting a spell with a thought component can take a move action before beginning to cast the spell to center herself; she can then use the normal DC instead of the increased DC.</p><p>Just as spell-like abilities never require verbal, somatic, or material components, these abilities also don't require thought or emotion components. A psychic spellcaster can replace verbal and somatic components with thought and emotion components only for the purposes of the spell components themselves, not for the purposes of any other rules elements that relate to verbal and somatic components. She can't use Silent Spell to ignore the thought component of a spell, for example. The new feats Intuitive Spell and Logical Spell serve a similar function for these new components, and appear in Chapter 3.</p><h1>UNDERCASTING SPELLS</h1><p>Some psychic spells can be undercast. This means that the spellcaster can cast the spell at the level that he knows, or as any lower-level version of that spell, using the appropriate spell slot. When a spellcaster undercasts a spell, it is treated exactly like the lower-level version, including when determining its effect, saving throw, and other variables. For example, a psychic spellcaster who adds <i>ego whip III </i>to his list of spells known can cast it as <i>ego whip I</i>, <I>II</I>, or <I>III</I>. If he casts it as <i>ego whip I</i>, it is treated in all ways as that spell; it uses the text and the saving throw DC for that spell, and requires him to expend a 3rd-level spell slot.</p><p>Whenever a spontaneous spellcaster adds a spell to his list of spells known that can be undercast, he can immediately learn a spell in place of each lower-level version of that spell he knows. In essence, he loses each earlier version and can replace it with another spell of the same level that is on his spell list.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter4psychicmagic\">^Psychic Magic</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter5occultrules\">Occult Rules</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"MrieHf01SFwhwFnL"}

This vital principle grants beings animate force, carrying directions from their greater intellects to their gross physical forms. With practice, an initiate in the occult arts can manipulate this force to create fantastic manifestations of psychic phenomena. Different traditions have different names for this vital force-prana, odic force, orgone energy-but it is most commonly known as ki, the source of inner power that grants the monk his incredible powers.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Practiced initiates can learn to pierce the veil between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane to gaze upon the interplay of ki within a creature's body. The energy concentrates in seven swirling circular pools positioned throughout the body, known as chakras. From there it flows through the creature's form, and even emanates 2-3 feet out, creating an ovoid nimbus around the creature-its aura.</p><p>The energy of the aura permeates the body and spirit of a living creature, influencing its health and vitality while in turn being influenced by the creature's disposition, conception of self, and general emotional state. A creature's aura thus comprises many different auras intermixed with one another to form a singular whole. Emanations of the creature's ki form its health aura. Radiations of thought and belief issuing from the creature's soul suffuse the health aura with patterns that can be interpreted as its alignment aura. The flashes of color flowing through the whole reveal the creature's attitude and disposition, and are known as its emotion aura. Finally, an aura might contain emanations of a magical origin, which is usually a consequence of outside forces at work on the creature.</p><p>Various spells can detect aspects of a creature's or object's aura. The <i>analyze aura </i>spell and the read aura occult skill unlock (see page 197) are the most comprehensive ways to assess a creature's entire aura.</p><h1>ALIGNMENT AURA</h1><p>A creature's alignment aura reflects the true nature of its beliefs and inner soul. This aura resembles a churning mist that suffuses the health aura. Close observation of the strange currents in this mist can identify the creature's alignment. Objects or locations infused with powerful magic attuned to a particular alignment (such as the blood-splattered altar at which a debased cult holds its unspeakable rituals or a gilded cup holding the tears of a long-dead saint) sometimes also have alignment auras.</p><p>The strength of an alignment aura is based on the creature's Hit Dice or the magic item's caster level, as referenced in certain detect spells (see page 266 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>).</p><h1>EMOTION AURA</h1><p>A creature's emotion aura reveals its current disposition and attitudes. These factors color the emanations of the aura with a coruscation of hues known as the emotional spectrum. Any combination of colors from the list in the picture can define a creature's emotional state. Typically, methods of perceiving the emotion aura reveal the emotions themselves, as well as the associated colors. The secrets of the emotional spectrum are laid bare to the initiate, and should not remain mysterious to the player.</p><p>Since emotion auras are a function of the health aura, they are not often associated with objects or undead creatures, which are not technically alive. Intelligent magic items sometimes have an emotion aura, while undead- particularly those on the Ethereal Plane barred from the afterlife because of emotional distress or unfinished business-may bear a tattered remnant of their auratic energy clinging to their haunted forms, even though the life energy that created them ceased long ago.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>The Emotional Spectrum</h1><p>A character trained in auratic techniques sees an interplay of colors within a creature's aura. Understanding the colors of this emotional spectrum can reveal a great deal about the observed creature. The colors constantly blend and shift as the creature's thoughts, emotions, and surroundings change. An observation of a creature's aura is a snapshot of its feelings and general character in a given moment, and might not be accurate days or even minutes later.</p><p><b>Anger (Bright Red)</b>: Bright red flashes, usually on a field of black, denote anger. The more selfish the anger, the more the red is tinged with brown. Righteous indignation, or anger for what the creature considers a just cause, manifests as lightning-shaped flashes of brilliant vermillion.</p><p><b>Deceit (Oily Green)</b>: An oily green aura denotes deceit and cunning, making spells like <i>analyze aura </i>very useful during interrogations.</p><p><b>Faith (Blue)</b>: A blue aura signifies religious thought, emotion, and feeling. The hue varies based on the nature of the sentiment, its basis in tolerance or prejudice, and its degree of self-interest. The lighter the tone, the more altruistic and beneficent the feeling. Deep, dark violet denotes religious belief twisted toward selfish or malevolent ends.</p><p><b>Fear (Livid Gray)</b>: The colors of the aura of a creature experiencing fright and terror fade away, leaving a livid gray cloud in their place. Some overwhelmingly evil creatures- particularly undead-exude a fear aura whose tendrils extend out several feet, reaching toward nearby creatures and bringing an oppressive malaise to their surroundings.</p><p><b>Flexibility (Emerald Green)</b>: A creature possessed of versatility, adaptability, and a willingness to please gives off an emerald green aura. Though green is usually associated with deception, it here represents compromise and low deceit-going along for the greater good despite personal misgivings or other preferences.</p><p><b>Greed (Brown-Red)</b>: A dull, brown-red aura-nearly the color of rust-suggests avarice and greed, and usually manifests in parallel bars across a creature's body. Greenish-brown tinged with red flashes represents jealousy.</p><p><b>Hatred (Black)</b>: Thick black clouds within the aura denote hatred and malice. When a person is overcome with passionate anger, dark images twist and turn within the cloudy aura like ghostly snakes swimming through smoke.</p><p><b>Intellect (Golden)</b>: Gold denotes a person's intellect. When aimed at lower, personal ambitions, the hue tends toward deep, dull shades. The hue assumes a glowing brilliance as the creature mixes spiritual illumination with intelligence.</p><p><b>Love (Scarlet)</b>: Among the loveliest auratic hues are the crimsons of a creature in love. The associated shades range from the gorgeous rose shade of selfless love for another to the dull, heavy scarlet tinged with the brown of greed for selfish love concerned with how much it receives in kind. A brilliant rose tinged with lilac denotes spiritual love for all creatures.</p><p><b>Melancholy (Gray Lines)</b>: A gloomy series of dark gray, parallel vertical lines conveys depression or deep melancholy. Like the brown lines of greed, the gray bars of melancholy suggest an emotional prison.</p><p><b>Passion (Blood Red)</b>: Sanguinary red suggests animal passions and unconscious instinct. As a creature sleeps, its aura tends to be overtaken by this hue as its visceral nature takes over while the mind wanders the Dimension of Dreams in the sheath of its lucid body (see page 241).</p><p><b>Pride (Orange)</b>: Orange indicates pride and ambition, and ranges in hue as these emotions are flavored by jealous competition (green), fear of falling behind (pale gray), or even self-love (dull crimson).</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>HEALTH AURA</h1><p>A creature's health aura is a direct representation of the vital force flowing within its body. Ki comes from various sources in the outside world and flows into and throughout the nervous system via a series of swirling pools known as chakras. Within the body, vital force has a faint rosy hue that fades outward into a vaporous white cloud. This aura is streaked by lines extending like bristles. When a creature is in normal health, these bristles stand out stiffly; when the creature is ill, they droop like the whiskers of a weary animal.</p><p>Interpretation of the vital force's flow between chakras and the fine lines emanating through the greater aura can allow the observer to note whether the creature is unharmed or wounded, if it is poisoned or diseased, and whether it is under any of the following conditions: confused, disabled, dying, nauseated, panicked, staggered, stunned, or unconscious.</p><h1>MAGIC AURA</h1><p>Magic auras are usually the result of external forces working on an object, creature, or location. Each magical effect swirls together in the greater aura, but remains discrete. It's possible to target specific effects within the aura to, for example, dispel a single magical effect while leaving the others intact.</p><p>Other magic auras are the result of a creature's inherent supernatural abilities, and can have game effects on those who approach too closely. Such auras (such as a dragon's frightful presence) often force creatures to attempt saving throws to resist their effects. For more information on magic auras, see <i>detect magic </i>(<i>Core Rulebook </i>267).</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter5occultrules\">^Occult Rules</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter6runninganoccultgame\">Running an Occult Game</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"Oqdg2vaJPGJczp0c"}
{"name":"Possession","permission":{"default":0,"JgpLZkPryhl1EFab":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_5ifacq93nyc","path":"Pathfinder RPG - Occult Adventures Reference Library#/CF_SEP/Occult Adventures#/CF_SEP/CHAPTER 5: OCCULT RULES","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\"></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Rather than introducing new rules, this section explains the nuances of possession magic, as used in the new <i>possession </i>spell (see page 181), as well as monster abilities and other spells.</p><h1>WHAT IS POSSESSION?</h1><p>True possession is when a creature displaces or overrides the target's consciousness with its own, establishing direct control over the target's body. The Pathfinder RPG features several effects that are often conflated with possession. The section below describes several possession and possession-like effects and the differences between them.</p><p><b>Domination</b>: Dominate spells are often confused with possession, as they produce superficially similar outcomes. However, domination and possession are not the same. Domination is mind-control, enslaving the target's mind and forcing it to carry out the caster's will; thus, the caster doesn't directly control the target's body. The target's dominated mind merely carries out a mandate given by the caster with the means, knowledge, and experience it has available.</p><p><b>Spell Possession</b>: Prior to <i>Occult Adventures</i>, the primary source for possession mechanics in the Pathfinder RPG was the <i>magic jar </i>spell. <i>Magic jar </i>allows the caster to detach her soul from her body and place it in the body of another creature, displacing the host's soul and leaving the caster's own body essentially \"empty.\" Like <i>possession</i>, these effects belong to the necromancy school of magic, as befits magic that manipulates life force and souls. This is true possession, as the end result is control of the host's body rather than the mind. The <i>marionette possession </i>spell (<i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic </i>228) operates under an identical principle, but does not displace the host's soul because the target cedes control to the caster willingly.</p><p>These forms of possession carry great risk for the caster. The caster has no means of survival without a body to inhabit, so if her soul is ejected from the host's body while her own body is out of the spell's range, the caster dies instantly.</p><p>The <i>possession </i>spell presented in this book follows similar rules to <i>magic jar </i>and <i>marionette possession</i>, but with a few key differences. <i>Possession </i>does not displace the host soul when the possessor seizes control of a creature's body. Additionally, the caster does not perish instantly if her body is outside the spell's range when she is ejected; the range on the <i>possession </i>spell pertains only to the distance the caster can be from her intended target at the time of casting. Once ejected, the caster's soul snaps back to her body from any distance, so long as it remains on the same plane.</p><p><b>Incorporeal Possession</b>: Ghosts, shadow demons, and similar creatures do not possess physical bodies- they are simply disembodied souls. They use the rules below to govern the interaction between their mental characteristics and their hosts' physical forms. Such a creature merges with the host's body and is unharmed when ejected. Creatures that use <i>magic jar </i>can often use the new <i>possession </i>spell instead.</p><h1>CORE MECHANIC AND CLARIFICATION</h1><p>The <i>possession </i>spell contains the core mechanics for possession. The description of the <i>magic jar </i>spell states the possessing creature can use her \"mental abilities,\" and the <i>possession </i>spell works similarly. This term wasn't previously defined, and has been a source of confusion in many games. The term \"mental abilities\" as used here refers to the following.</p><list><p><li>The possessor uses her skill ranks, along with any feats the possessor has for which she still qualifies in the host's body. The possessor doesn't gain any of the host's feats or skill ranks, but does apply bonuses and penalties associated with the host's body. For example, when attempting Fly checks, a character who possessed a bird would use her own ranks in the Fly skill, but the bird's Dexterity modifier and racial, size, and maneuverability bonuses.</li><li>The possessor can use spells and spell-like abilities. Appropriate spell components and foci are still required for spells that call for them. Some spell-like abilities are racial in nature, but the soul's essence temporarily instills the possessing creature's quintessential nature into the host's body. For instance, a shadow demon possessing a paladin can still use its racial spell-like abilities during that time.</li><li>The possessor can use nonmagical and magical class abilities such as domain, hex, rage, and school powers.</li></p></list><p>Supernatural abilities (with the exception of class abilities) are not considered mental abilities, as they generally rely upon a creature's physical form. For example, a red dragon possessing a cleric of Iomedae could not use its breath weapon ability to breathe fire while inhabiting the cleric's form. The GM can choose to make a specific exception if she believes an ability is solely mental in nature.</p><h1>RULE INTERACTIONS</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Several different mechanics allow a creature to influence or control another creature, and sometimes it isn't clear how these competing effects should play out, whether it be possession versus compulsion or even possession versus possession. These systems interact in the following ways.</p><p><b>Possession versus Charm and Compulsion</b>: Possession overrides charms and compulsions that are in control of another creature. Neither type of effect prevents the other from functioning, but possession bypasses the mind and takes direct physical control of the body-which may result in a possessor enslaving an intelligence that is essentially helpless already because of a compulsion. Compulsion and charm effects move with the mind or soul of the creature originally targeted. For example, if you cast <i>mind swap </i>(see page 177) on a dominated creature,</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>the domination effect remains active but transfers with the originally dominated mind to its new host body, and a dominated creature capable of possession could possess another creature while still remaining dominated.</p><p>If the host's mind or soul is not displaced from the body, a dominating creature can still telepathically interact with its now-possessed target, even though the target is helpless within its own hijacked body. The dominating creature can even command the target to explain what the host body is doing, if the host has access to its senses.</p><p>Conversely, a caster can target a possessing creature with a compulsion or charm effect. If the possessing creature is the only mind or soul in the host body, the compulsion or charm effect works on the possessing creature normally. If the possessing creature is later evicted from the body, the compulsion or charm effect remains active on the possessing creature when it returns to its original body. For instance, if a mesmerist is using <i>mind swap </i>on a bard, and a succubus uses her <i>dominate monster </i>spell-like ability when she meets the possessed bard, the mesmerist must attempt a saving throw against the spell. If he fails, the mesmerist becomes dominated by the succubus, and when his possession ends and he returns to his body, he remains at the mercy of his new mistress.</p><p>When both the host creature and a possessing creature occupy a body at the same time, a charm or compulsion effect can target either one. However, the caster must be aware of the possessing creature's presence in the host body in order to target it. Otherwise, the effect targets the host by default, generally with limited effect.</p><p><b>Possession versus Divination Effects</b>: Possession does nothing to obfuscate or block most divination spells. For example, if an evil mesmerist is possessing a paladin, <i>detect evil </i>will sense the presence of an evil creature when the paladin's body enters the area of effect. The Hidden Presence feat can assist a possessing creature in foiling divinations. If a creature's body and soul are in two different locations, as in the case of a caster of <i>magic jar</i>, divination spells that depend on location, such as <i>locate creature </i>or <i>scrying</i>, fail to produce results. The exception is <i>discern location</i>; this powerful spell provides both locations unless the body and soul are protected by <i>mind blank </i>or a deity.</p><p><b>Possession versus Possession</b>: If you attempt to possess a creature that is already possessed, the possessing creature must succeed at the <i>possession </i>spell's save or be ejected, allowing you to enter the host. If the possessing creature voluntarily fails its save, first that creature is automatically ejected and then the host attempts the Will save instead. A possession effect that doesn't allow a saving throw automatically causes the possessing creature to be ejected.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter5occultrules\">^Occult Rules</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter6runninganoccultgame\">Running an Occult Game</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"Oyq55soe3h2u92ky"}

Arcane tradition conceptualizes this multiverse of planes as a series of nesting spheres, with each layer and the spaces between representing different vistas of reality. At the center of it all, suspended within the silvery seas of the Astral Plane, lies the Inner Sphere of the Elemental and Material Planes. The Elemental Planes are the raw building blocks of the multiverse, while the planes aligned with positive and negative energy govern the forces of life and death, creation and destruction. The invisible mists and eddies of the Ethereal Plane connect and interpenetrate the worlds of the Inner Sphere, just as the Astral Plane connects these worlds in turn to the infinite realms of the Outer Sphere, the domains of gods and the final destination for the souls of the multiverse.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>The esoteric tradition, sometimes referred to as the \"ancient wisdom,\" acknowledges the many planes, demiplanes, and corners of the Inner and Outer Spheres, but tends to focus more on the Inner Sphere than the realms of the deities. Scholars of occultism believe that their investigations reveal a hidden truth behind the multiverse, and that mastering the implications of this secret can give an adept power over not just her mortal life, but also her life after death. She can then enter a cycle of reincarnation that allows, over successive cycles of existence and reflection, the complete mastery of body, mind, and soul, opening up new vistas of consciousness and immortality.</p><p>Consequently, the adept does not concern herself with the courts of petitioners enjoying their final reward or laboring eternally under fiendish masters, nor with the raw building blocks of the material world such as air, earth, fire, and water. Her final personal journey into a more evolved existence is loftier than the base elements, and more self-determined than the proscribed fate of the pious petitioner.</p><p>The orthodox view of the planes sees two opposing forces underlying existence in the multiverse: positive and negative energy. Each of these primal forces commands a vast plane of its own at the core of the Inner Sphere. The Positive Energy Plane is the source of life, and the Negative Energy Plane is the source of death; each exists as antithesis to the other. The great secret of occultism holds that rather than positive and negative energy being conflicting forces, they are in fact two halves of a single whole. Their polarity is not a sign of opposition, but rather two integral aspects of a single dualistic cycle. The positive aspect of this duality is the Cosmic Fire, the breath of life that grants vital force to living creatures. The Negative Energy Plane is the intake of that same breath, a return to dust, the recycling of component parts to pave the way for that which comes next.</p><p>Delving deeper into the ancient wisdom reveals even more enticing secrets regarding the nature of existence. Among the oldest creatures in the Great Beyond are the enigmatic outsiders known as aeons, who are said to be the caretakers of reality and the original architects and crafters of the multiverse itself. Befitting the esoteric view of the planes, these primordial beings always manifest a powerful dichotomy sustained in equilibrium: Birth and death. Fate and freedom. Creation and destruction.</p><p>The aeons believe they are bound in a supreme oneness with the multiverse known as the \"monad,\" or the \"condition of all,\" the transcendental undersoul of all living creatures. They equate this oneness with both the life-giving Cosmic Fire of the Positive Energy Plane and the destructive void of the Negative Energy Plane. Furthermore, they do not limit this cosmic oneness to themselves, but rather include all of the multiverse's creatures within their concept of the monad. A human and a pleroma aeon (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 </i>12) are both emanations of the cosmic flame-the aeon is simply much closer to the source and believes itself to be in communication with it, whereas the monadic soul of a human is esoterically distant from the Fire, being focused primarily on the mortal affairs of the base Material Plane.</p><p>Imagine a blazing sphere of brilliant energy blocked by a thick screen. This sphere represents the Cosmic Fire. Now imagine multitudes of tiny holes in the screen, each allowing some of the light to shine through. From the exoteric viewpoint of the uninitiated, each pinpoint of light appears distinct and unique. The esoteric perspective looks behind the screen and understands that all of the individual lights are but rays from a single source. A creature's soul is like one glimmering light in that screen's field of stars, and when mortal scholars speak of \"a monad,\" they're usually referring to this individual-seeming expression of the universal undersoul, at once a unique entity and part of the common soul of the multiverse. The greater an adept understands her place in this scheme, the more power she holds over her eternal destiny.</p><p>The short summaries below offer an occult viewpoint on the realms generally referred to as the Esoteric Planes. Many prominent planes in the orthodox scheme, such as the Shadow Plane and Elemental Planes, do not feature prominently in the cosmology of the adept concerned with multiversal truths and the journey of the mortal soul. Occultism freely acknowledges the existence of these planes, but does not dwell on them, an approach likewise observed here. For more information on these planes, including their planar traits, see the <i>GameMastery Guide</i>.</p><h1>POSITIVE ENERGY PLANE</h1><p>The Positive Energy Plane is the source of all life, the Cosmic Fire at the heart of the multiverse that gives birth to mortal souls. The plane has no surface and exists as an emanation of life-giving energy radiating from an incandescent interior that resembles the molten heart of an active star. Ironically for a plane associated with life, the Positive Energy Plane can be extremely deadly to mortal visitors, as its ambient energies are so powerful that a mortal shell cannot absorb them without bursting. At certain vertices, the refraction of the Cosmic Fire's rays create islands of solidity where the plane's energies are not so extreme, and some manner of life as mortals understand it becomes possible. Here, upon vast shimmering fields, phoenix-feathered creatures known as the jyoti tend to orchards of glowing, anemone-like trees as tall as mountains, sprouting immature souls like glossy, liquid fruit. The xenophobic jyoti dwell in complex cities of crystal specially designed to reflect the weird luminescence of the Cosmic Fire. Jyoti seldom venture from these structures, focusing all of their energies on their sacred charge of tending and defending the nascent souls of the multiverse. At the center of each jyoti city is an imposing gate to a star in the cosmos of the Material Plane. New souls pass through these gates and ride waves of light to find incarnation in mortal vessels.</p><p>If the jyoti dedicate themselves to the protection of incubating immature souls, the other primary inhabitants of the Positive Energy Plane, the manasaputras, dedicate their existence to assisting the spiritual development of mortals. These \"sons of mind\" are the powerful psychic incarnations of mortals who have endured scores of mortal reincarnations, with each step becoming more attuned to the universal undersoul. The greatest and most powerful of the manasaputras-the glory-clad solar kumaras- dwell within the heart of the Cosmic Fire, and claim to be in communication with it. Lesser manasaputras like agnishvattas, barhisads, and manus spread through the Inner Sphere to initiate mortal adepts in the occult nature of the multiverse, so that they too might step once again into the light that birthed them.</p><p>For reasons unknown even to the eldest natives, divine beings cannot enter the Positive Energy Plane. Refugees from the vengeance of the gods or those hoping to hide</p><p>important relics from certain divinities sometimes venture to the Positive Energy Plane to negotiate with the jyoti, who over the centuries have amassed an astounding trove of world-shattering artifacts, illegitimate half-mortal bastards, heretics, and other dangers.</p><h1>NEGATIVE ENERGY PLANE</h1><p>The orthodox view of the Inner Sphere casts the Negative Energy Plane as the jealous rival of its positive-energy twin, an empty infinite void of entropic darkness antithetical to creation, fit only to consume and destroy. Negative energy is itself a dark opposite of life-giving positive energy, yet while it is most often a source or tool of destruction, it is also the animating force of the undead. The ancient wisdom of occultism seizes on this seemingly paradoxical association with creation and posits that entropy clears the slate for what's next as the multiverse inexorably marches along an unimaginably vast evolutionary cycle of its own. Perfection is not a fixed state. It is always growing and changing. To say that there is one \"natural\" state-for instance, utter oblivion-that constitutes perfection is as impossible as imposing a limit on the infinite. Occultists believe that this destruction allows for and drives change.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Nonetheless, negative energy sustains the undead, who throng to the sterile and desolate gulfs of nothingness that compose the overwhelming expanse of this dark and terrifying realm. The plane offers few solid surfaces, so the undead present here tend to be incorporeal and capable of taking flight on the soul-chilling currents that seem inexorably to guide visitors toward the absolute darkness at the plane's heart. This inner blackness connects via portals to the black holes scattered about the cosmos of the Material Plane. Records of astral voyages to the Material Plane side of these portals relate tales of the accretion disks of black holes swarming with incorporeal undead trapped within the event horizon.</p><p>Within the plane, where the concentration of negative energy reaches an absolute, it begins to manifest a crystalline material that grows into beautiful and deadly structures of absolute entropy. When these crystals form strange angles, the plane gives birth to a sceaduinar. These vile creatures hate life and unlife alike, and exist only to sow entropy and destruction. Somehow, their manifestation seems to drain a measure of the plane's entropic energies, ironically making the regions around these haunting snowflake structures the most stable and survivable regions in the otherwise hostile plane. While negative energy is less of a concern, the sceaduinar themselves represent a significant threat to visitors.</p><p>The ancient wisdom suggests that the jyoti hate the sceaduinar for their knowledge of the role destruction plays in the creation of souls, and the jyoti fear the exposure of that information. The Negative Energy Plane's most terrible and hateful residents, the undead abominations known as nightshades, care little for this squabbling between the planes. Theirs is a quest to eradicate all life in the cosmos, to cloak the stars of the Material Plane in darkness, and to quench the Cosmic Fire, no matter the consequences.</p><h1>MATERIAL PLANE</h1><p>The Material Plane is the realm of physical sensation and incarnate existence. Souls manifest here in the shell of a physical body, a union so complete that most living creatures do not spend much time contemplating the difference between the gross physical form and the higher monadic soul that guides its movements and destiny. The final destination of a soul is not yet determined during its mortal life, making the Material Plane a magnet for the attentions of gods and outsiders eager to rally mortals to their banners in the afterlife, either willingly or by force. A planar crossroads, the Material Plane is coexistent with the Ethereal and Shadow Planes and coterminous with all of the realms of the Inner Sphere.</p><p>Just as little-known forces bind a physical body to its astral and ethereal counterparts, the whole of the universe is bound together by a series of ley lines- spiritual conduits that interpenetrate the many planes of the multiverse. Ley lines are prevalent on the Material Plane, and wise adepts of the occult arts, canny students of the arcane, and even village witches learn to recognize and manipulate these forces to their own ends. Some believe that one of the most prominent of these ley lines is the so-called \"River of Souls\" that guides a monad's spiritual journey through mortal incarnation and the afterlife, but that is just one aspect of this multiversal arterial network.</p><h1>ETHEREAL PLANE</h1><p>The Ethereal Plane is the seat of emotional forces, the mist-shrouded home of haunts and horrors, and the ever-present doorway between the worlds of the Inner Sphere. The Ethereal Plane coexists with these planes, interpenetrating them and generally mimicking their contours and vistas, albeit with greatly reduced visibility thanks to drifting fog and the slow rise and fall of fading sheets of light like the somber interior of a thunderstorm. From within the Ethereal Plane, these neighboring worlds appear hazy and indistinct, as if viewed through frosted glass. Inhabitants of neighboring planes can't perceive the Ethereal Plane at all, though certain mortals blessed or cursed with psychic sensitivity sometimes catch glimpses of its vistas. Since the Ethereal Plane is generally invisible from the other planes of the Inner</p><p>Sphere, creatures under the effects of spells like <i>ethereal jaunt </i>and <i>etherealness </i>cannot be seen by creatures who are not themselves ethereal. Normally, creatures on the Ethereal Plane cannot attack creatures on the Material Plane, and vice versa.</p><p>Within the mists of the Ethereal Plane, warped, indistinct versions of locations overlap their Inner Sphere counterparts. This, coupled with the inherent weightlessness of creatures in the plane, makes it tempting to use the Ethereal Plane as a vantage to scout out unknown locales by passing through incorporeal walls and floating over traps with ease. The natural denizens of the plane make this a frightful prospect, however, and ensure that most forays into the Ethereal Plane are brief endeavors. Among the deadliest of local hazards are the blood-red ill-warlike, plane-shifting outsiders who incubate their eggs in living mortals. Worse still, hideous, cackling night hags use the Ethereal Plane as a byway to the Dimension of Dreams, where they slip into nightmares to abduct mortal souls.</p><p>The twisted remnants of mortal souls comprise the vast majority of the Ethereal Plane's inhabitants. Some souls, freed from their physical bodies by death, remain tethered to the Ethereal Plane by profound emotional distress and cannot proceed along multiversal currents to join the River of Souls flowing inexorably toward the Boneyard until they sever the powerful emotional ties that bind them. Indeed, the longer these souls remain stalled on their afterlife journey, the closer they slide toward the Negative Energy Plane, and the more of their memories and personalities become subsumed by raw emotional distress and psychic damage. These souls eventually manifest as incorporeal undead, frequently in the form of wraiths and spectres.</p><p>Spiritualists call out to the spirits of the Ethereal Plane and open their physical minds as refuges for them to inhabit. With practice and the help of a trained spiritualist, a spirit can even take its own physical form on the neighboring planes by cloaking itself in a sheath of ectoplasm, the ghostly substance that acts as a veil between worlds. These spirit guides are known as phantoms, and while they are loyal to the spiritualist to whom they are bound, the emotional connection to the Ethereal Plane remains strong, manifesting in jealousy and fiery outbursts from even the kindest of souls. The ectoplasmic nature of the Ethereal Plane is extraordinarily susceptible to the thoughts and emotions of the plane's inhabitants. The ethereal version of a physical location is informed not just by its actual dimensions and appearance, but also by the memories and impressions of the spirits that haunt it. For example, on the Ethereal Plane, an old mansion might look as it did in the era of its ghostly inhabitants. If those spirits find final rest, their memories cannot sustain the structure, and it falls into an ethereal ruin. Some incorporeal spirits become so entwined with the emotional nature of the plane that they can manifest these ectoplasmic vistas in an overlapping location on a neighboring plane, temporarily cloaking it in a disturbing reflection of some past incarnation.</p><p>In a similar way that locations in the outside world possess overlapping etheric reflections, mortal creatures also have ethereal doppelgangers in the form of etheric doubles that exactly overlie their physical forms. The etheric double is a vessel for the cosmic breath of life that gives a creature animate force, most commonly known as ki. This energy collects in seven blazing vortices of colorful energy known as chakras, which bind the etheric double and the physical body together and distribute vital life energy to both. This energy extends 2 to 3 feet beyond the outlines of the creature's physical form to create its aura, a nimbus of colorful occult energies that reveals much about a creature's disposition and emotional state.</p><p>A creature's etheric double, aura, and chakras are not visible except to those with the knowledge or magic to see them. From the Material Plane, this involves esoteric use of the Perception skill by a creature with the Psychic Sensitivity feat (see page 138) or any of a number of spells. From within the Ethereal Plane, all it takes to observe the interplay of these forces is simple concentration- if you know what to look for, it becomes plainly visible. Interpreting this information, of course, is another matter. An etheric double is outlined in violet-gray or blue-gray luminescence. Unlike an astral body generated by <i>astral projection </i>or a lucid body of the Dimension of Dreams, an etheric double is not normally capable of acting as a separate vehicle of consciousness.</p><p>Finally, the sweeping expanse of the Ethereal Plane is home to countless pocket realities known as demiplanes. Many of these unique realms are the private domains of powerful arcane spellcasters, the playgrounds of minor gods, the experiments of the inscrutable Elohim, or the prisons of creatures that pose such danger to the cosmos that they must never be released.</p><h1>DIMENSION OF DREAMS</h1><p>As a mortal sleeps, its monadic soul withdraws from the physical body to manifest in the Dimension of Dreams. This dream avatar is known as the lucid body, and can take a variety of forms based on the dreamer's sub-consciousness. The minds of the countless dreamers of the Material Plane brush up against the Ethereal Plane, bubbling forth ephemeral demiplanes in which the dreamers' lucid bodies experience fantastic adventures inspired by their own unconscious minds. A dreamer can alter her surroundings, and one with the Lucid Dreamer feat gains a greater measure of control. Spells cast and items used in a dream are not depleted in the real world. Wounds and conditions don't have any effect on the creature's waking body and mind. Fantastic adventures don't yield real treasure or experience to the waking being, though knowledge gained in the Dimension of Dreams occasionally aids in solving real challenges faced in the waking world. Even the worst nightmares hold little true danger for the dreamer. Should the lucid body die, the dreamer simply awakens, perhaps a bit shaken but otherwise little worse for the experience. A creature with the Lucid Dreamer feat (see page 137) awakens from such an experience fatigued, as her mind is more invested in perceptions of the dreamscape.</p><p>Experience in a dreamscape is usually a private affair. Rare spells (such as <i>dream council</i>), magic items, and other abilities allow creatures to enter and share another creature's dream demiplane for a short amount of time. While these secondary dreamers can interact with the highly morphic qualities of the plane, with the primary dreamer, and with each other, the existence of the demiplane is still contingent on a single primary dreamer. When the primary dreamer awakens, the demiplane pops out of existence, causing any other dreamers to continue dreaming-shunted into a dreamscape of their own creation-or to wake up.</p><p>A lucid body is not the only way to enter a dream, however, and considerable danger faces the explorer who enters the Dimension of Dreams in his physical body. Regular methods of planar travel like <i>plane shift </i>do not offer transit to the dream world-only specialized means such as the <i>dream travel </i>spell do the trick. When a physical creature enters a dreamscape, he doesn't have to make the check to determine his initial state, but also can't attempt impossible feats (see below). Spells cast, magic items used, and other limited abilities expended are lost just as if the creature were adventuring on some other plane. Creatures in their material forms can use items generated within a dreamscape, but these items wink out of existence when the primary dreamer awakens, or when a creature in material form leaves the dreamscape. Wounds and experiences are real, and remain after the creature leaves the dreamscape. A creature in its physical form that dies within a dream demiplane actually dies. Material creatures still within a dreamscape when the primary dreamer awakens are pushed into an abutting dreamscape or regions of the Ethereal Plane that border the Dimension of Dreams.</p><p>Although each dreamer's slumbering soul conjures a personal demiplane dreamscape that manifests on the Ethereal Plane, all dreams collectively belong to the greater network of the Dimension of Dreams. When numerous dreamscapes cluster in the ethereal fog, transit between dreams is easier, and moods, emotions, and even creatures from one dream spill more easily into another. Where the individual dreamscapes brush up against the little-understood Dimension of Time, dreams often take on prophetic elements.</p><p>Figments from the dream world sometimes manage to escape the Dimension of Dreams, usually at the moment when a particularly imaginative sleeper awakens, and the reality of the dream is at its weakest as the demiplane fades away. These weird, shifting creatures stalk the Ethereal Plane as animate dreams, feeding off the minds of mortals, searching for other dreams in which to take refuge and torment a new sleeper.</p><p>A class of vile so-called \"nightmare creatures\" infests the Dimension of Dreams, venturing from dreamscape to dreamscape hunting victims to torment and destroy. A hierarchy of horror known as the Nightmare Lords rules over lesser nightmare creatures in puppet courts staffed by the soul-shriveled husks of insane enslaved dreamers. Somehow, these creatures have even found a way to manifest on the Material Plane, not content to limit their terrors to the realm of sleep.</p><p>Night hags are among the most harrowing threats of the Dimension of Dreams. They walk freely between dreams, searching for chaotic or evil dreamers, on whose backs they ride until morning. Creatures they encounter between dreams or dwelling within the dreamscapes of their prey are simply cut down, regardless of alignment. Night hags collect the souls of their slain enemies in gemstones they sell to clientele throughout the planes.</p><p>Although most dreamscapes are ephemeral, fading when the sleeper awakens, particularly potent dreamscapes, bolstered by recurrence or by the shared subconscious of numerous dreamers, sometimes last forever. Among the most formidable and permanent regions of the Dimension of Dreams is the bizarre realm of Lang, where near-human denizens sail ethereal seas in black-hulled ships packed with slaves bound for the dark markets of the multiverse.</p><p>The Dimension of Dreams has the following traits.</p><list><p><li><b>Flowing Time</b>: Both lucid bodies and creatures visiting the Dimension of Dream with their physical bodies are subject to the flowing time trait of a given dreamscape.</li><li><b>Highly Morphic</b>: When a creature enters a dreamscape with a lucid body, it must make a Charisma check (DC 15) to prevent arriving in the Dimension of Dreams at a disadvantage, such as without important equipment or on the side of an arctic mountain during an avalanche. A successful save means the dreamer manifests in perfect health, with all of its regular equipment (spells and magic items used in a dream are not actually expended in the real world). Even in the worst of circumstances, however, the lucid body is capable of fantastic-even impossible-feats. As a standard action, a number of times during the dream equal to the creature's Charisma bonus (minimum 1) the dreamer can attempt one impossible action, such as casting a spell, gaining an effect of a spell as if it were cast, or conjuring a magic item. This requires a successful Charisma check (DC 10 + the level of the spell being cast or spell effect replicated or half of the caster level of the item conjured; nonmagical items are caster level 0). Other fantastic feats are also possible with GM approval and a Charisma check with a DC determined by the GM. If the check fails, the dreamer cannot perform the feat. Creatures that enter the dream with their physical bodies do not need to make the initial check and do not gain the ability to create items and spell effects or perform other fantastic feats, but must otherwise deal with the strange realities of the dreamscape.</li><li><b>Wild Magic</b>: Both lucid bodies and creatures visiting the Dimension of Dream with their physical bodies are subject to the wild magic of dreamscapes.</li></p></list><h1>ASTRAL PLANE</h1><p>The Astral Plane is the great silvery sky that connects all planes to one another, the realm of pure thought and expanded consciousness. Occasional islands of solid matter float in astral space, but most of the plane is an enormous, seemingly eternal void of silver radiance. As a gateway between the Inner and Outer Spheres, the Astral Plane teems with travelers, from entities venturing between planes to explorers searching for one of the numerous demiplanes secreted here or looking for the one of the countless marooned spirits that dwell within the expanse. Its nature as a crossroads makes the Astral Plane very dangerous. Although it's possible to visit the plane bodily via <i>plane shift </i>or by using an item such as a <i>robe of stars</i>, most travelers prefer to play it safe by manifesting their souls in an astral body created by spells such as <i>astral projection</i>.</p><p>A creature's astral body looks like a translucent version of its physical form, usually limned with a soft nimbus of blue or violet light. A slim tether of resilient incorporeal energy known as a silver cord connects a creature's astral body to its unconscious physical body. If the astral body dies, the silver cord retracts into the physical body, returning the soul to its familiar seat (albeit at the cost of two permanent negative levels due to the resultant trauma). A silver cord resists most attempts to damage it, but if it somehow manages to break, the creature immediately dies, and the astral form housing its soul is cast adrift on the astral currents, pulled inexorably toward the enormous spire of the Boneyard, which extends up into the Astral Plane from the surface of the Outer Sphere. As a realm of thought, the Astral Plane is home to entities that represent concepts, myths, and legends spawned from mortal thoughtforms. Mediums open their consciousness to these denizens of the Astral Plane, inviting them to reside in a physical form and spread their influence on the Material Plane.</p><p>Travel through the Astral Plane is a strange affair, as the plane's subjective directional gravity means that each traveler chooses the direction of gravity's pull. Creatures can move normally in any direction by imagining \"down\" near their feet and \"falling\" in that direction. In this way a creature \"falls\" 150 feet the first round and 300 feet on each successive round. Movement is straight-line only. A character can attempt a DC 16 Wisdom check to set a new direction of gravity or stop as a free action; this check can be attempted once per round. Any character who fails this Wisdom check on successive rounds receives a +6 bonus on subsequent checks until he succeeds. When moving in this manner, the traveler does not have the sensation of physical movement. Rather, the landscape of the Astral Plane (such as it is) seems to come toward, through, and past him. Scintillations of light are thrown off by the astral body as it moves along at great speed.</p><p>The untethered astral bodies of the dead flow toward the Boneyard along the River of Souls. During this process, the dross of mortality is shed, leaving behind only the soul's core self, its memories, and the refined character of its prior life. The gods of the Outer Sphere consider the River of Souls inviolate, often sending celestial and infernal outsiders to help steward wayward souls toward judgment and eventual delivery to their afterlife of reward or punishment. Soul-collecting or soul-devouring predators such as night hags and astradaemons prey on the dead of the Astral Plane, usually limiting themselves to picking off isolated incorporeal undead but all too often raiding parties of disembodied souls as they make their way toward eternity. Pharasma, the goddess of the dead, hates this perversion of the natural order of the multiverse, and the entities known as psychopomps often act as guides to deliver souls safely to their final destinations.</p><p>Other inhabitants of the Astral Plane include enormous astral leviathans that float through the silvery seas, sometimes with passengers or even semi-permanent settlements upon their backs; strange caulborn who harvest knowledge and psychic energy from astral travelers; formless nirmanakaya manasaputras who seek to guide Material Plane adepts through telepathy; and the lean humanoid outsiders known as the shulsaga, multiplanar hunters who ride magical disks and view intruders to their astral realm with xenophobic disdain.</p><h1>AKASHIC RECORD</h1><p>Deep within the Astral Plane lies a demiplane called the Akashic Record that forms a critical part of the ancient wisdom at the heart of occult philosophy. The Akashic Record is a visual library of perfect psychic records of every moment in the history of the multiverse. Those who find their way here can observe scenes from any moment from the recent to distant past, going all the way back to the beginning of the multiverse. When a dead creature's untethered astral body sees its life flash before its eyes as it awaits judgment in the Boneyard, its consciousness ventures to the Akashic Record. When a psychometrist divines a touched object's past, he really gains impressions from scenes stored in the Akashic Record.</p><p>Unlike the history books of mundane existence, the Akashic Record is a perfect recording of events as they actually happened. Two creatures observing the same event in real time might come away with very different subjective understandings of what just occurred, but such confusion is impossible in the Akashic Record, which occultists speak of as the memory of nature. It is also known as the Book of the Lipika by the mysterious cloaked aeons who act as the Lords of Karma and who record every event in a mortal's life to measure its rightful place in the afterlife.</p><p>A visitor consulting the Akashic Record simply turns her attention to the moment she wishes to observe, and it appears before her, not as a two-dimensional image like an illustration on page, but rather all around her, as if she were actually present witnessing the desired moment in history. The actors before her are unconscious of her presence, as they are but reflections. The observer can't change or affect their actions in any way.</p><p>The observer can set the pace of events. He understands perfectly all communications within the record, even if he would not otherwise understand languages read or spoken, or the importance of cultural norms and signals otherwise foreign to him. If the event in question is from the observer's own life, he may choose to view it as an outsider, or may inhabit his form and live out the event again, re-experiencing the emotions associated with the event the first time around.</p><p>Traveling to the Akashic Record, which abuts the mysterious Dimension of Time, is incredibly difficult. Spells that allow for planar travel, such as <i>plane shift</i>, cannot take a seeker to the Akashic Record. While occult</p><p>lore suggests several methods to \"enter\" the Akashic Record and influence the visions seen there (for example, to rescue a character from some past scene and escape with her to the Astral Plane), those doing so risk becoming lost in the currents of the Dimension of Time, marooned in the real past of the observed event, very likely never to return. Such meddling with the affairs of time risks drawing the ire of the Lords of Karma, unleashing retributive time elementals or inevitables, or attracting the bloodthirsty otherworldly predators known as the hounds of Tindalos.</p><p>The Akashic Record has the following traits.</p><list><p><li><b>Flowing Time </b></li><li><b>Finite Shape </b></li><li><b>Static </b></li></p></list><h1>THE BONEYARD</h1><p>A massive spire stretches deep into the sliver expanse of the Astral Plane from the surface of the Outer Sphere, beckoning unfettered monads on the River of Souls toward their final destinations in the afterlife. At the pinnacle of this spire is the Boneyard, a necropolis of graveyards, mausoleums, and solemn courts dedicated to Pharasma, goddess of death. This gloomy realm, also known as Purgatory, is home to countless souls awaiting final judgment. Clad in the sheaths of their astral forms, these somber sojourners bask in deep reverie, reliving scenes from their mortal lives during a solitary, inward journey of remembrance and catharsis.</p><p>This process, sometimes known as the \"kama-loka,\" allows the soul to revisit key scenes from its mortal life and evaluate the lessons of its previous incarnation on the Material Plane. Only when it has worked through the psychological troubles of its past can it proceed further along the River of Souls. As a soul reflects upon and settles its past affairs, it lets go of its ties to these events and begins to forget them, cleansing its soul for the glorious (or terrible) transformations to come. This is why petitioners in the Outer Sphere seldom remember much of their mortal existence, and why most mortals cannot remember anything of their past incarnations on the Material Plane.</p><p>The ancient wisdom sometimes analogizes the soul's final moments as gazing into the Lake of Mortal Reflections, and seeing the whole of one's existence flash before one's eyes. The lessons of the manasaputras who guide the occult development of mortals suggest that the greatest esoteric fate is not to simply glance at the lake, but to step fully into its waters and allow them to subsume you. A soul immersed fully in the waters of the Lake of Mortal Reflections sheds the karma and experiences of its past life and, once again, the cleansed monadic soul descends into a new physical body in a cycle of reincarnation. With each subsequent reincarnation, the monad gains a greater appreciation for the experiences of a multitude of different incarnations, underlying the concept of the universal undersoul represented by the Cosmic Fire. With this understanding comes greater control over the soul's final incarnation as an outsider. According to esoteric lore, the most learned adepts are able to choose their own fates, becoming powerful outsiders, peerless mortal \"ascended masters,\" or even living gods.</p><p>The majority of souls do not reincarnate. When they finish the kama-loka process, their astral forms stand ready for final judgment. For some souls, the kama-loka progresses rapidly, while for others it can take years, decades, or even longer. Within Pharasma's courts, the native psychopomps work in concert with ambassadors from the realms of the Outer Sphere to guide souls to the final resting place that best matches their religious beliefs and ethos. In the unlikely event of deathbed conversions, renouncements of faith, or disputed soul-binding pacts, advocates for the souls' potential fates argue with one another. The most significant disputes are seen to by Pharasma herself.</p><p>The Boneyard has the following traits.</p><list><p><li><b>Timeless</b>: Age, hunger, thirst, afflictions (such as diseases, curses, and poisons), and natural healing don't function in the Boneyard, though they resume functioning when the traveler leaves the Boneyard.</li><li><b>Divinely Morphic</b>: Deities with domains in the Boneyard can alter the plane at will.</li><li><b>Strongly Neutral-Aligned </b></li><li><b>Enhanced Magic</b>: Spells and spell-like abilities with the death descriptor, or from the Death or Repose domains, are enhanced.</li></p></list><h1>OUTER SPHERE</h1><p>The silver void of the Astral Plane extends from the edge of the Inner Sphere to the planes of the Outer Sphere, where souls sent from the Boneyard arrive at their final afterlife destinations in realms attuned to their beliefs and alignment. By the time they arrive here, those mortal souls who did not immediately incarnate as outsiders or direct servitors of their deities are known as petitioners. Having transcended mortal life, their past existence means less and less to them as time goes on. The few petitioners who even remember those they left behind cannot bring themselves to worry for them, focusing instead on the paradises or hellscapes immediately before them.</p><p>As time progresses, petitioners become more and more attuned to their chosen or assigned plane. Some manage to eventually ascend into the form of an outsider associated with their plane, but others simply end their journey of existence by merging completely with their plane in body and soul, vanishing from reality altogether and becoming quintessence-the very matter of the Outer Sphere itself.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter6runninganoccultgame\">^Running an Occult Game</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter7occultrewards\">Occult Rewards</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"QNkcnU27qOSErmzy"}

Through the esoteric secrets of the occult, bold seekers of knowledge can bring a candle to light the darkness of the unknown, and begin to unravel that strangest of all riddles: the truth.</p><p>Within this hidden world, you'll find strange and wondrous new powers, vast and unknowable enemies, and unlikely allies who request strange favors in return for the esoteric lore they hoard. You'll voyage into the mind, out of your body, and onto other planes of existence. If you keep your wits about you, you may return alive-but even then, few survive such an experience unchanged. To achieve your goals, what will you lose of yourself? What will you be willing to sacrifice? Who will you become?</p><p>Practitioners of occult lore often refer to the hidden magical traditions of the occult as \"psychic magic.\" Casting a psychic spell relies entirely on the thoughts and emotions surging through your mind and spirit, rather than on incantations or gestures. In this way, occult practitioners can hide in plain sight amongst other spellcasters. Your village's local sorcerer might be a kindly psychic searching for the solution to a karmic riddle, or a cunning mesmerist slowly building a cult of mind-controlled followers. Yet in the world of the occult, mysteries contain layers upon layers, and the solution to the psychic's karmic riddle might release a horror trapped on the Astral Plane, while the mesmerist's mind-controlled cult may be there to protect the villagers from a great evil sealed deep beneath the town.</p><p>Protecting innocents from dangers they can't see-or even comprehend-requires a unique breed of heroes, those initiated in esoteric lore and willing to take risks with not just their bodies, but their minds and souls as well. Occult power comes at a price, and even if you're willing to pay it, you may find the responsibilities it brings largely thankless. When a paladin uses her holy might to stop an army of undead from rampaging through the king's lands, she might gain a knighthood or noble title, not to mention the adulation of the kingdom. But when an occultist uses his object lore to prevent a mad architect from changing the geometry of city districts until it blends and merges with that of a malevolent sentient metropolis from an alien dimension, he and the architect may be the only ones who truly understand the threat. And if the architect is beloved by citizens and authorities alike for his philanthropic works and grand civic monuments, the occultist who saved the city may well need to flee before he finds himself in a prison cell. And even then, will he avoid the wrath of other members of the architect's secret society and their monstrous interdimensional patrons? Such are the lives of those who labor at the edge of mortal understanding, and who know that each action, however well intentioned, has unintended consequences, like ripples in a pond.</p><h1>WHAT ARE OCCULT ADVENTURES?</h1><p>Any adventure could incorporate occult elements, from mystery cults to creatures that attack the psyche, so in a world where wizards and clerics ply their spells in the open and magic is accepted and understood, what separates an occult adventure from any other adventure? The core concept that drives an occult adventure is that raw power isn't everything. In a typical campaign, adventurers strive to improve their might so they can take on bigger and bigger challenges. But a student of the occult knows that power can corrupt, that some battles can never be won by brawn, and that there are beings capable of ignoring the normal rules of the multiverse, walking among even the greatest and most powerful like a wolf among sheep.</p><p>One of the hallmarks of an occult campaign is a focus on the mind over direct combat and confrontation. Most occult classes possess more mental abilities than physical, and they have the tools to peer into thoughts, ask for aid from the beyond, and unravel mysteries. Rather than exploring only physical ruins, occult adventurers uncover the psychic history of places and objects. When magical weapons can't defend against vengeful spirits, a treatise on the manifestation of extraplanar beings may hold the key. Subverting the doctrines of a cult proves a more certain method of ending its threat than killing its leader would.</p><p>An occult adventure is a study in complications and paradoxes, in which uncovering a mystery reveals an even greater mystery. Knowledge is the only way to deal with an occult problem, but learning more invites even greater danger. Exploration of a strange plane or dreamscape might show that the place is even more complex than initially thought. A crusade to defeat a dark and unknowable force can lead to a climactic encounter in which the adventurers discover their quarry doesn't fear its own destruction or banishment. Likewise, occult creatures and forces can find adventurers just as mystifying and contradictory as the adventurers find the denizens of the occult.</p><p>Suggestions for running occult adventures, as well as common elements that appear within them, are detailed in Chapter 6: Running an Occult Game.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Book References</h1><p>This book refers to several other Pathfinder Roleplaying Game products using the following abbreviations, yet these additional supplements are not required to make use of this book.

Psychic magic is an entirely new type of spellcasting that follows different principles than arcane and divine magic. A psychic spellcaster doesn't have to obey the same restrictions as an arcane or divine caster, and forgoes the physical components of spells entirely. She doesn't need to wave her arms, speak words laden with magical portent, or burn up symbolic physical matter in the process of casting. Instead, she need only keep her mind aligned properly, providing a detailed mental image or bringing up a particular emotion to cast her psychic spell. Even someone bound or paralyzed can cast a psychic spell, as long as her intellectual and emotional states aren't compromised. Self-doubt, lack of concentration, and fear are the enemies of a psychic caster, not the depredations of the physical world.</p><p>For all their differences, psychic spells are still spells, and psychic spellcasters are still spellcasters. Most of the spells a psychic character can cast resemble those of her arcane and divine allies, albeit accessed in an alternative way. Consequently, the spell lists for psychic spellcasters largely consist of existing spells, and non-psychic casters can also choose many of the spells in <i>Occult Adventures</i>.</p><p>The rules for using psychic magic are detailed fully in Chapter 4: Psychic Magic.</p><h1>NAVIGATING THIS BOOK</h1><p>Each chapter of this book contains rules arranged around one particular theme, such as classes, archetypes, feats, or spells. While most of the chapters are useful for GMs and players alike, Chapter 6 in particular is of great use to GMs interested in running an occult game.</p><p><b>Chapter 1-Occult Classes</b>: Where are the heroes who can save the world from the unknowable threats of the occult? Right here in this chapter, which includes six new occult classes! Not only are these classes a perfect fit for a game steeped in the occult themes found throughout this book, they also contain the same variety of themes, concepts, and play styles that you've come to expect from Pathfinder RPG base classes, allowing them to flourish in nearly any campaign, from a game of somber horror to a lighthearted dungeon romp. The following is a quick overview of some of the most interesting and iconic features of each class.</p><p><i>Kineticist</i>: Masters of the elements, kineticists wield a strange and ill-controlled power as their bodies strain to act as vessels for the roaring might of the Elemental Planes. A kineticist can manipulate the elements both in combat to destroy her foes and out of combat to aid her team. By straining her body past the limits of safety, she can increase her ability beyond what she can ordinarily achieve. If you want to play a mystical non-spellcaster who can pay a great personal price to boost her abilities in emergencies, you should consider playing a kineticist.</p><p><i>Medium</i>: The Astral Plane is home to entities of thought that are shaped and empowered by tales of those who came before. The medium channels these legendary spirits, idealized versions of the original stories' protagonists, and uses the spirits' varied powers to change his own so he can fill any role a party might need. If you enjoy versatility and the ability to be exactly what the group needs in a given situation-as well as roleplaying interactions with spirits and the drawbacks of being influenced by them-you should consider playing a medium.</p><p><i>Mesmerist</i>: Master mentalists and consummate liars, mesmerists use their eerie stares to weaken their foes and contingent hypnotic tricks to prepare their allies in advance for bad situations. The mesmerist fills the support role of the bard, but instead of strengthening and protecting his allies, he weakens and disables his foes. If you enjoy playing a skillful character who can support the party but are interested in shaking it up by being more on the offensive, you should consider playing a mesmerist.</p><p><i>Occultist</i>: Steeped in esoteric lore but still strongly tied to the physical world and its trappings, occultists access magic through the power of their implements, which may be magic items or even ordinary objects with psychic significance, such as a saint's finger bone, a dagger used in 99 ritual sacrifices, or a necklace belonging to the occultist's mother. With resonant and focus powers from his implements, plus psychic spells, a large set of skills, object-reading powers, and powerful binding circles, the occultist has something to add to almost any situation. If you enjoy playing a well-rounded character whose abilities revolve around a collection of unique items, you should consider playing an occultist.</p><p><i>Psychic</i>: Powerful and enigmatic, psychics are the primary spellcasters of the occult world, and the sole practitioners of certain psychic spells of great power. Each psychic approaches her magic through a chosen discipline that grants her special abilities, and her mastery of the art of phrenic amplification allows her to alter and adjust her spells on the fly to suit her needs. If you like playing spellcasting characters such as sorcerers and also enjoy versatility and tinkering, you should consider playing a psychic.</p><p><i>Spiritualist</i>: When the dead are chained to the mortal world by strong emotions, they inevitably descend toward the Negative Energy Plane, warping and twisting into undead. A spiritualist bonds with one of these spirits before that transformation is complete, providing a safe haven for this phantom and gaining a powerful servant in exchange. If you want a companion with the ability to switch between a variety of forms and even meld into your character's form to increase her options, you should consider playing a spiritualist.</p><p><b>Chapter 2-Archetypes</b>: Bring the power of the occult to all your favorite classes or customize the new occult classes with dozens of archetypes. In addition, you'll find new alchemist discoveries, cavalier orders, sorcerer bloodlines, and witch patrons. Will you play a psychic detective or a battle host? A ghost rider or a tome eater? No matter what kind of character you like to play, this chapter has plenty of fun new options for you to explore.</p><p><b>Chapter 3-Feats</b>: This chapter contains dozens of feats-some supporting the new classes, others available to any character looking to dip her toes into the occult, and still others that tie into the new occult rules in Chapter 5. From a teamwork feat allowing you to combine two elemental blasts into a composite one to a feat allowing you to open your mind to other people's emotions at the cost of weakening your mental defenses, these feats allow you to build all sorts of occult characters.</p><p><b>Chapter 4-Psychic Magic</b>: This chapter introduces psychic magic, a completely new type of magic that's neither arcane nor divine, and that uses thought and emotion components instead of verbal and somatic ones. Of the panoply of new spells in this chapter, several are spells that can be undercast-with this new type of tiered spells, spellcasters who know them are also able to cast all the weaker versions. Whether you use <i>akashic form </i>to keep a copy of yourself that you can employ to escape death, or create an enormous vessel to sail the Dimension of Dreams with <i>dream voyage</i>, you'll never be the same again (especially if you cast <i>major mind swap </i>to switch bodies forever)!</p><p><b>Chapter 5-Occult Rules</b>: This chapter contains a variety of exciting new subsystems that are part and parcel of an occult game but also fit easily into any game, either on their own or taken all together.</p><p><i>Skill Unlocks</i>: Occult skill unlocks build on the idea of skill unlocks for the rogue from <i>Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained</i>, adding new and wondrous applications to your favorite skills that are open to occult characters and psychic sensitives alike. Use Linguistics for automatic writing to foretell the future, Appraise for psychometry to learn more about an object's past, Heal to perform startling acts of faith healing, and much more.</p><p><i>Auras</i>: Those attuned to the occult can learn much about a creature, object, or place from its aura. While magic and alignment auras have been in the game since the start, this section details aura types such as emotion and health, and adds new depth to the metaphysical meaning of auras.</p><p><i>Chakras</i>: By studying the esoteric lore of chakras, you can learn a deeper application of ki and use kundalini serpent-fire energy to awaken the chakras within you. By successively opening your chakras, you become increasingly powerful as battle continues-so long as you can survive the strain!</p><p><i>Psychic Duels</i>: Enter an inner dueling ground where the only limits to what you can do are your own imagination. When your foe calls forth a thought-form cobra, counter it with a thought-form hydra. When she threatens you with psychic vines, unleash a storm of inner fire. Such battling is exhausting, and never undertaken lightly- for despite the unreality of the mindscape in which you fight, the stakes of such a duel are life and death.</p><p><i>Psychic Possession</i>: Possession and body-swapping spells can be crucial to occult adventures, and this short section provides you with everything you need to know to play a body-snatching character with ease.</p><p><i>Occult Rituals</i>: Some of the deepest and darkest secrets of the occult, these esoteric rituals are vanishingly rare and challenging to perform, but provide fantastic power to any character who can complete them-even those not normally able to cast spells. A GM can choose from the variety of sample rituals or design her own, but one thing's for sure-with occult rituals, you'll never look at spellcasting quite the same way.</p><p><b>Chapter 6-Running an Occult Game</b>: This chapter is your official advisor on how to infuse your game with mystery, secrets, and menace, and is full of useful tips and lore on the esoteric mindset.</p><p><i>Elements, Themes, and Adventure Seeds</i>: This section is a perfect guide to running occult games for dabblers and adepts alike. It begins with definitions of occult elements-the building blocks of a successful occult game-interweaves those elements into themes, and finally draws from those themes to create a variety of occult adventure seeds ready for your next occult adventure.</p><p><i>Occult Locations</i>: Occult locations often have mysterious elements that can grant those who explore them information or power-at a cost. While haunts have been in the game since the <i>Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide</i>, the new options in this section enhance the narrative aspect of a haunt's mechanics. Conversely, the new loci spirits represent a benevolent option for lingering spiritual energy. Ley lines crisscross the multiverse and lend power to any spellcaster who finds the rare spots where she can tap them. Mindscapes are mental landscapes that open the door to fantastic and exciting adventures in a creature's mind, or psychically created worlds where the normal rules no longer apply.</p><p><i>Esoteric Planes</i>: This chapter explores the esoteric view of the multiverse held by occult scholars. The occult view of the multiverse is full of mysteries, secrets, and unusual parallelisms. Learn more about some of the odd realms that are paramount in the esoteric view, from the Dimension of Dreams to the Akashic Record and beyond.</p><p><b>Chapter 7-Occult Rewards</b>: The only way to fight against some of the harshest and most alien occult threats is armed with objects of occult power. From simple mundane gear that can amplify occult skill unlocks to the mightiest artifacts, occult rewards are strange and exceptional. In this chapter, you'll find items and esoterica from a variety of occult traditions, from a lucky <i>four-leaf clover </i>to the mighty <i>stannum crown</i>. You'll discover ways to travel to realms beyond imagining, such as the bizarre <i>flying skiff </i>or the enigmatic <i>portal network</i>. Will you tempt fate by reaping the benefits of a cursed <i>monkey's paw </i>or <i>maniac hand</i>, knowing they may turn against you and those you love? As with all things in the world of the occult, what seems too good to be true probably is, and may come at a price you can only begin to comprehend.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_introduction\">^ Introduction</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1occultclasses\">Occult Classes</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"Rna4gkTIPHPBsGYT"}

Creating a new occult ritual has five main steps.</p><p><b>Step 1-Concept</b>: As when creating any rules component, you should begin by deciding what you want the ritual to do. Rituals are often an interesting way to introduce unusually powerful magical effects into your game in a limited or controlled way. They can also introduce these effects in a manner that is more specific than similar higher-level spell effects. The ritual's purpose should influence subsequent design decisions.</p><p><b>Step 2-Determine School</b>: Once you have the concept for the ritual, next determine which school best suits the ritual's effect, just as if it were any other type of spell. If you're unsure which school is most appropriate, compare the effects with existing spells. If a ritual could have one or more possible schools, determine which is the most relevant school and use that one.</p><p><b>Step 3-Determine Ritual Level</b>: This step involves setting the level of the occult ritual. Occult rituals are always equivalent to at least 4th-level spells. Often the best way to determine a ritual level is to compare it to other spells in the game, or to use the guidelines for designing new spells found on pages 128-139 of <i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic</i>. The ritual level determines how many total successes are required to cast the ritual, the DCs for the skill checks needed to complete the ritual, the save DC for the ritual's effect (if applicable), and indirectly determines the ritual's range and duration.</p><p>The number of skill checks the ritual requires is equal to the level of the ritual, and the base DC of the skill checks needed to complete a ritual is 28 + the ritual level.</p><p>Any saving throw DCs of the ritual (including any DC to remove a temporary negative level gained by the backlash or by failing the ritual) are equal to 10 + the ritual level + the primary caster's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma bonus (whichever is highest).</p><p>In general, the spell a ritual is based on will give guidelines on the range, targets, area, effect, duration, and any saving throw or spell resistance that applies. If you are unsure or are creating a new effect for your ritual, you can use the suggestions in the Ritual Benchmarks Based on School picture on page 215.</p><p>While the ritual's school or the spell it's based on gives you a starting point for the ritual's details, you may want to deviate from those examples when determining the particulars. Doing so to a greater or lesser degree can and should affect the skill check DCs for casting a ritual, and can also affect the casting time of a ritual. Table 5-1: Modifying Occult Rituals gives some examples of how to modify DCs and casting times.</p><p><b>Step 4-Determine Ritual's Skills</b>: This step involves determining the skills required to cast the ritual. The chosen skills should have a connection to the concept or the effect of the ritual. While a number of Knowledge skills are obvious choices (especially Knowledge [arcana] and Knowledge [religion]), more interesting rituals may feature other skills. Often these other skills allow secondary casters to play a more active role in the casting or make the ritual more interesting and challenging. In all cases, you should require checks from two or more skills.</p><p><b>Step 5-Create Backlash and Failure Effects</b>: The last step is to figure out the effects of the ritual's backlash and what happens to the casters if the ritual fails. Like modifying the base spell or deviating from the baselines of the ritual's school, the backlash and its severity can affect the DCs of the skill checks made to cast the ritual (see Table 5-1: Modifying Occult Rituals). Backlashes should be minor debilitations rather than severe punishments, and you need to decide whether they affect just the primary caster or all the casters.</p><p>Failure effects should be much more severe and should not invalidate or overlap with the effects of the backlash (since the backlash occurs whether or not the ritual succeeds). They should always represent the cost associated with the casting of uncontrolled magic, and they can be very debilitating to the casters, and could even harm those not associated with the ritual (especially for high-level rituals).</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Table 5-1: Modifying Occult Rituals</h1><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td colspan=\"10\"><b>Casting Time</b></td><td colspan=\"4\"><b>Check DC Modifieror Modification</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">Casting time is restricted (such as \"only during a full moon\")</td><td colspan=\"4\">-4</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">Casting time is severely restricted (such as \"only during a lunar eclipse\")</td><td colspan=\"4\">-8</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"14\"><b>Focus and Material Components </b></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">Expensive material component (500 gp)</td><td colspan=\"4\">-1</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">Expensive material component (5,000 gp)</td><td colspan=\"4\">-2</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">Expensive material component (25,000 gp)</td><td colspan=\"4\">-4</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">Expensive focus (5,000 gp)</td><td colspan=\"4\">-1</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">Expensive focus (25,000 gp)</td><td colspan=\"4\">-2</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"14\"><b>Range </b></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">Greater range than normal</td><td colspan=\"4\">+1 to +6</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">Shorter range than normal </td><td colspan=\"4\">-1 to -4</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"14\"><b>Area </b></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">Larger area than normal</td><td colspan=\"4\">+1 to +6</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">Smaller area than normal</td><td colspan=\"4\">-1 to -4</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"14\"><b>Target </b></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">Unwilling target must be helpless</td><td colspan=\"4\">-2</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">Limited targets (by HD, creature type, and so on)</td><td colspan=\"4\">-3</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">Single target to multiple targets</td><td colspan=\"4\">+4</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"14\"><b>Duration </b></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">Greater duration than normal</td><td colspan=\"4\">+1 to +6</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">Shorter duration than normal</td><td colspan=\"4\">-1 to -4</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">One year or more</td><td colspan=\"4\">casting time in increments of 1 hour/level instead of 10 minutes/level</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"14\"><b>Backlash </b></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">Per 2d6 points of damage</td><td colspan=\"4\">-1</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">Caster is exhausted</td><td colspan=\"4\">-2</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">Per temporary negative level caster gains</td><td colspan=\"4\">-2</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">Per permanent negative level caster gains</td><td colspan=\"4\">-4</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">Caster reduced to -1 hp</td><td colspan=\"4\">-3</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">Caster infected with disease</td><td colspan=\"4\">-4</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">Caster suffers curse effects</td><td colspan=\"4\">-4</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\">Backlash affects secondary casters too</td><td colspan=\"4\">-1</td></tr></table></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Occult Ritual Benchmarks by School</h1><p>Each summary below specifies the range, target, duration, and other aspects of an occult ritual associated with a particular school.</p><p><b>Abjuration</b>: <b>Range </b>close;

All who hear the supernatural knocks are affected by a <i>cause fear </i>effect (Will DC 11 negates).</p><p><b>Destruction </b>Depending on its alignment, a rapping spirit typically asks for its mortal remains to be laid to rest or for the PCs to seek revenge for its death. Fulfilling the request dismisses the haunt.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Demanding Dead (CR 3)</h1><p>Some haunts influence the thoughts and actions of those in the mortal realms to communicate their anger, desires, or goals, which can lead to instances of direct-voice channeling and automatic writing. While the demanding dead are sometimes malevolent, more often there is a method to their requests, which could potentially reveal shocking secrets or the key to putting them to rest forever.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>DEMANDING DEAD CR 3</h1><p><b>XP 800 </b></p><p>Alignment varies persistent haunt (15-ft. radius)</p><p><b>Caster Level </b>1st</p><p><b>Notice </b>Perception DC 15 (to hear faint mutterings and feel a cool breeze)</p><p><b>hp </b>13; <b>Weakness </b>tricked by <i>hide from undead</i>; <b>Trigger </b>proximity; <b>Reset </b>1 day</p><p><b>Effect </b>This haunt seeks to influence the actions of the living, targeting a victim with a <i>suggestion </i>effect or a heightened <i>command </i>(save DC 14 for either).

Fulfilling the request dismisses the haunt.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Spectral Vermin (CR 5)</h1><p>Overwhelming, unresolved guilt-or horrific death by thousands of tiny teeth-can lead to the manifestation of ghostly vermin swarms. The haunted area often displays signs of ancient rodent infestation.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>SPECTRAL VERMIN CR 5</h1><p><b>XP 1,600 </b></p><p>CE free-roaming persistent vaporous haunt (30-ft.-by-30-ft. room)</p><p><b>Caster Level </b>5th</p><p><b>Notice </b>Perception DC 15 (to hear scratching in walls)</p><p><b>hp </b>22; <b>Weakness </b>tricked by <i>hide from undead</i>; <b>Trigger </b>proximity; <b>Reset </b>1 day</p><p><b>Effect </b>This free-roaming haunt wanders the vacant halls of old manors and dank dungeons.

The cat's ghost manifests and consumes the ectoplasmic swarm over the course of 1 week, earning both the cat and the rats permanent rest.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Malignant Weapon (CR 7)</h1><p>Sometimes a weapon that slays a powerful witch or hag becomes tainted by the victim's malignant hatred. Although haunted weapons often still bear holy marks from the original owners or relics like bones from a revered saint, these are never sufficient to contain the malevolence that dwells within the weapon.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>MALIGNANT WEAPON CR 7</h1><p><b>XP 4,800 </b></p><p>LE persistent item-bound haunt (haunted object affecting up to a 35-ft. radius)</p><p><b>Caster Level </b>7th</p><p><b>Notice </b>Perception DC 25 (to hear distant cackling when touching the weapon)</p><p><b>hp </b>36; <b>Weakness </b>tricked by <i>invisibility</i>; <b>Trigger </b>special (see below); <b>Reset </b>1 day</p><p><b>Effect </b>Whenever the wielder of the haunted weapon threatens a critical hit with the weapon, the area immediately resonates with a cacophonous cackling. All creatures within a 35-foot radius centered on the weapon suffer the effects of a <i>song of discord </i>spell (Will DC 17 negates) for the next 8 rounds. If the weapon's wielder is affected, she gains a +2 bonus on the critical confirmation roll.</p><p><b>Destruction </b>The weapon must be boiled in the cauldron of a willing hag's coven, which destroys both the weapon and the cauldron at the same time.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Insidious Presence (CR 9)</h1><p>This haunt hides within a host's body, at first offering tempting boons to make the host comfortable with their presence before ultimately seeking the host's destruction.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>INSIDIOUS PRESENCE CR 9</h1><p><b>XP 4,800 </b></p><p>NE possessing persistent spiteful haunt (45-ft. radius when not possessing a creature)</p><p><b>Caster Level </b>10th</p><p><b>Notice </b>Perception DC 20 (to feel a malignant presence and hear faint mutterings)</p><p><b>hp </b>40; <b>Trigger </b>proximity; <b>Reset </b>1 day</p><p><b>Effect </b>This haunt subtly possesses a living host as <i>possession</i>* (Will DC 20 negates) in order to sow fear and injury in the wider world. When it first possesses a host creature, the insidious presence may offer enticing boons for several months using its <i>shadow conjuration </i>effect (such as summoning allies to assist the host). But soon, the haunt's inner malignancy takes over as it uses its <i>shadow conjuration </i>(DC 18 where applicable) to produce harmful or even deadly effects against its host.</p><p>An insidious presence that has slain a number of different hosts equal to its CR undergoes a startling transformation.

All ranged attacks made with physical weapons suffer a 20% miss chance against you, except for attacks from massive weapons such as a giant's thrown boulder or a ballista. This ability has no effect on ray attacks. The miss chance increases by 5% for every 5 kineticist levels you possess beyond 2nd. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can increase the miss chance by 5% until the next time your burn is removed. You can continue to accept points of burn to increase the miss chance further, up to a maximum of 75%. Whenever you accept burn while using an air wild talent, the energy surging through you causes your enveloping winds to also affect non-physical ranged attacks such as ray attacks for 1 round. You can dismiss or restore this effect as an immediate action.</p><h1>Flesh Of Stone</h1><p><b>Element </b>earth; <b>Type </b>defense (Su); <b>Level </b>-; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>Your skin hardens like stone, dampening the impact of most attacks. You gain DR 1/adamantine. This DR increases by 1 for every 2 kineticist levels you possess beyond 2nd. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can increase the DR by 1 until the next time your burn is removed, to a maximum DR equal to your kineticist level. Whenever you accept burn while using an earth wild talent, the energy surging through you causes your damage reduction to change from DR/adamantine to DR/- for 1 round. You can dismiss and restore this effect as an immediate action.</p><h1>Force Ward</h1><p><b>Element </b>aether; <b>Type </b>defense (Su); <b>Level </b>-; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You constantly surround yourself with a ward of force. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your kineticist level. You always lose these temporary hit points first, even before other temporary hit points. If an attack deals less damage than you still have as temporary hit points from force ward, it still reduces those temporary hit points but otherwise counts as a miss for the purpose of abilities that trigger on a hit or a miss. These temporary hit points regenerate at a rate of 1 per minute. By accepting 1 point of burn as a standard action, you can increase the maximum number of temporary hit points provided by your force ward by half your kineticist level until the next time your burn is removed. If you use this ability multiple times, the increases stack. For every 2 points of burn you accept in this way, your force ward's rate of regeneration increases by 1 hit point per minute. Whenever you accept burn while using an aether wild talent, you siphon some of the energy from the aether flowing through you and your force ward recovers a number of temporary hit points equal to your character level, up to its current maximum. You can dismiss or restore your force ward as an immediate action, but doing so doesn't change the number of temporary hit points available, and the temporary hit points don't recover while this ability is inactive.</p><h1>Searing Flesh</h1><p><b>Element </b>fire; <b>Type </b>defense (Su); <b>Level </b>-; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>Your body becomes painfully hot. Whenever a creature hits you with a natural attack or an unarmed strike, that creature takes 1 point of fire damage per 4 kineticist levels you possess (minimum 1 point of fire damage). A creature in a grapple with you takes double this amount of damage at the end of each of its turns. Weapons that strike you also take this damage, though the damage is unlikely to penetrate the weapon's hardness. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can increase this damage by 1 point per 4 kineticist levels you possess until the next time your burn is removed. You can increase the damage in this way up to seven times.</p><p>Whenever you accept burn while using a fire wild talent, the surging flame causes your searing flesh to deal double its current amount of damage for 1 round (a creature in a grapple with you takes a total of four times as much damage as normal). You can dismiss or restore this effect as an immediate action.</p><h1>Shroud Of Water</h1><p><b>Element </b>water; <b>Type </b>defense (Su); <b>Level </b>-; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You surround yourself with a shroud of water, ice, or both that protects you from harm. The shroud can either cover your body, functioning as armor, or float around you and block attacks, functioning as a shield. It grants either a +4 armor bonus to AC or a +2 shield bonus to AC, and you can change the type of bonus as a standard action. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 kineticist levels you possess beyond 2nd. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can increase the bonus by 1 until the next time your burn is removed. You can increase the bonus multiple times in this way, but it can't be increased by more than 50% of its starting value. When you change the shroud to grant a shield bonus, any bonus in excess of this limit doesn't apply, but it remains if you change the shroud's bonus type again. Whenever you accept burn while using a water wild talent, the water coalescing around you allows your shroud to grant both the armor bonus and the shield bonus for 1 round. You can dismiss or restore this effect as an immediate action.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1occultclasses\">^Occult Classes</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypes\">Archetypes</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            "}

           <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>CLASS FEATURES</h1><p>The following are the class features of the occultist.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: An occultist is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p><p><b>Spells</b>: An occultist casts psychic spells drawn from the occultist spell list presented on page 58, limited by the implement groups he knows. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every occultist spell has an implement component (see Implements on page 47). To learn or cast a spell, an occultist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an occultist's spell equals 10 + the spell level + the occultist's Intelligence modifier.</p><p>An occultist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Occultist. In addition, he gains bonus spells per day if he has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1-3 on page 17 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>).</p><p>The occultist's selection of spells is limited. For each implement school he learns to use, he can add one spell of each level he can cast to his list of spells known, chosen from that school's spell list. If he selects the same implement school multiple times, he adds one spell of each level from that school's list for each time he has selected that school. When the occultist learns to cast a new level of spells, he immediately adds one spell of that level to his list of spells known from each implement school he knows (plus any extra spells from schools he has selected multiple times).</p><p>At 5th level and every 3 occultist levels thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), an occultist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the occultist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the highest-level occultist spell the occultist can cast. The spell learned must come from the same list of spells provided by the implement school of the spell lost. An occultist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for that level.</p><p>An occultist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.</p><p><b>Focus Powers (Su)</b>: At 1st level, an occultist learns the base focus power from both of his two implement schools (see Implements below) and can select one more focus power from the list of those available to him through those schools. Whenever the occultist learns a new implement school, he gains the base power of that school. In addition, at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, he learns a new focus power selected from the options granted by all of the implement schools he knows. The occultist can use focus powers only by expending mental focus (see Mental Focus on page 48). Unless otherwise noted, the DC for any saving throw against a focus power equals 10 + 1/2 the occultist's level + the occultist's Intelligence modifier. The occultist can't select a focus power more than once. Some focus powers require him to reach a specific occultist level before he can choose them.</p><p><b>Implements (Su)</b>: At 1st level, an occultist learns to use two implement schools. At 2nd level and every 4 occultist levels thereafter, the occultist learns to use one additional implement school, to a maximum of seven schools at 18th level. Each implement school adds one spell per spell level of that school of magic to the occultist's spell list. No spells from any other school are considered to be on the occultist's spell list until he selects the associated implement school. He can't use spell trigger or spell completion magic items from unknown schools without succeeding at the appropriate Use Magic Device check. An occultist can select an implement school more than once in order to learn additional spells from the associated school.</p><p>Each implement school is represented by a small list of objects. Every day, the occultist selects one item from that school's list to be his implement for the day for each implement school he knows. The occultist needs only one such item to cast spells of the corresponding school, unless he selected that implement school multiple times, in which case he needs one item for each set of spells gained from that school. Implements don't need to be magic items, and nonmagical implements don't take up a magic item slot even if they're worn. Implements that are not magic items are often of some historical value or of personal significance to the occultist, such as the finger bone of a saint, the broken scepter of a long-dead king, the skull of a mentor's familiar, or the glass eye of an uncanny ancestor.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Whenever an occultist casts a spell, he must have the corresponding implement in his possession and present the implement to the target or toward the area of effect. This act is part of casting the spell and doesn't require any additional action. If the occultist lacks the corresponding implement, he can attempt to cast the spell, but must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + the spell's level) to do so. Spells cast by an occultist without the appropriate implement are always treated as if they were cast at the minimum caster level for the spell in question (caster level 1st for a 1st-level spell, caster level 4th for a 2nd-level spell, and so on).</p><p>Each implement school also grants a base focus power. This power is added to the list of focus powers possessed by the occultist (see Mental Focus below). In addition, each implement school grants access to a number of other focus powers that the occultist can select from using his mental focus class feature.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>See the Implement Schools section starting on page 50 for a complete list of implements associated with each school and their focus powers.</p><p><b>Knacks</b>: An occultist learns one knack, or 0-level psychic spell, each time he selects an implement school (including when he again selects a school that he has already learned to use). These spells are cast like any other spell, but they can be cast any number of times per day. Knacks cast using any other spell slots because of metamagic feats applied to them, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p><p><b>Mental Focus (Su)</b>: An occultist can invest a portion of his mental focus into his chosen implements for the day, allowing him to utilize a variety of abilities depending on the implements and the amount of mental focus invested in them. An occultist has a number of points of mental focus equal to his occultist level + his Intelligence modifier; these points refresh each day. He can divide this mental focus between his implements in any way he desires. If an implement is lost or destroyed, the focus invested in it is lost as well, though the occultist still refreshes those points of focus normally.</p><p>Once mental focus is invested inside an implement, the implement gains the resonant power of its implement school (see page 50), and the occultist can expend the mental focus stored in the implement to activate the associated focus powers he knows. If a resonant power grants a bonus that varies based on the amount of mental focus invested in the implement, the bonus is determined when the focus is invested, and is not reduced or altered by expending the mental focus invested in the item. Once all of the mental focus in an implement has been expended, it loses its resonant power until mental focus is once again invested in the implement.</p><p>The implement grants its resonant power to whoever possesses it; the occultist can lend the implement to an ally to assist that ally, but if he does so, he has difficulty casting that implement's spells (see Implements on page 47) and can't expend that implement's focus on focus powers until he retrieves the implement or refreshes his focus.</p><p>The occultist refreshes his mental focus once each day after receiving at least 8 hours of sleep. After refreshing his mental focus, the occultist must spend 1 hour preparing his implements and investing them with this power. Mental focus that is not used before the next time the occultist refreshes his focus is lost.</p><p>The occultist can choose to save generic mental focus inside his own body instead of investing all of it, but expending this focus comes at a higher cost. Any focus power the occultist activates with generic focus costs twice as much mental focus to use (and to maintain, if applicable). The occultist can expend his generic focus through an appropriate implement on any focus power he knows, but an implement he didn't invest any focus in at the start of the day grants no resonant power.</p><p><b>Magic Item Skill (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, an occultist's knowledge of magic items grants him a bonus when attempting to use them. He gains a bonus on all Use Magic Device checks equal to 1/2 his occultist level.</p><p><b>Object Reading (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, an occultist learns how to read information from items he examines. Examining an item in this way requires him to spend 1 minute handling the item. If the item is a magic item, the occultist learns its properties and command word as if he had successfully examined the item using <i>detect magic </i>and succeeded at a Spellcraft check. This ability does not reveal whether the item is cursed unless the occultist's class level is equal to or greater than the caster level of the item. If the item has any historical significance, the occultist learns one piece of information about its past (as determined by the GM). Finally, if the item was last used no longer than 1 day ago per the occultist's class level, the occultist learns one piece of information about the last creature to use the item. This information might be a glimpse of the creature's appearance, a brief vision of what it saw while using the item, or perhaps its emotional state when it last used the item. The GM determines what information is gained in this way. This functions like the psychometry occult skill unlock (see page 196), but doesn't require a skill check and can be used at will.</p><p><b>Shift Focus (Su)</b>: At 4th level, an occultist gains the ability to shift his mental focus from one implement to another, though some of the focus is lost along the way. Shifting mental focus removes a number of points of mental focus from one implement and adds the same number - 1 to another implement; this takes 1 minute of quiet contemplation while touching both implements. The occultist can shift his mental focus only from one implement to another implement; he can't shift generic focus into an implement. Unlike expending focus normally, this shift can reduce the effect of a resonant power in the implement from which the mental focus was taken. It does not, however, add to the resonant power of the implement to which the focus is added.</p><p><b>Aura Sight (Su)</b>: At 5th level, the occultist can read the auras of creatures around him as a standard action. This functions as the <i>aura sight</i>(ACG) spell with a duration of 1 round.</p><p><b>Magic Circles (Su)</b>: At 8th level, an occultist learns how to draw magic circles. To draw a circle, he must have chalk, salt, blood, powdered silver, or some other appropriate substance at hand (although he can press a magic circle into a softer surface such as dirt or clay). Drawing a circle takes 1 minute and requires the occultist to expend 1 point of mental focus (either generic focus or focus from any one of his implements). Once completed, this circle functions as a permanent <i>magic circle </i>against any alignment of the occultist's choosing. The circle can't be against a component of the occultist's alignment (if he is lawful good, for example, it can't be a <i>magic circle against good </i>or <i>law</i>). The circle remains until its form is physically broken (for example, if the lines are smeared or the salt is scattered). Only a living creature can break the circle; environmental effects can't break it. An occultist can have only one circle created in this way at a time. If he creates a second circle, the first one loses all its magic powers. This type of magic circle can't normally be focused inward to bind an outsider.</p><p><b>Outside Contact (Su)</b>: At 8th level, the occultist learns the true name of one particular outsider. This outsider can have no more than 3 Hit Dice. Whenever the occultist creates a magic circle, he can expend 1 additional point of mental focus to focus the circle inward and lure that outsider to the circle (similar to using <i>lesser planar binding</i>). The outsider is bound for up to 10 minutes. During this time, the occultist can bargain with the outsider for one piece of information. This requires a payment of at least 20 gp (or items of at least that value that are of interest to the outsider). The bargaining requires the occultist to attempt a Diplomacy or Intimidate check opposed by the outsider's Sense Motive check. Succeeding at the check by 5 or more reduces this cost to 10 gp. Failure increases the price to 30 gp, whereas failure by 5 or more allows the outsider to escape without giving any information (or receiving payment). The information gained can be anything that might be learned through a <i>divination </i>spell. The information is always correct but is frequently cryptic. It typically takes the outsider 1d3 hours to gather the information, at which point it returns of its own accord to deliver the information as promised. The outsider always resents being used in this way, even if the occultist and the outsider share an alignment component. After the occultist bargains with the outsider, the magic circle loses all power and the outsider is sent back to its home plane.</p><p>At 12th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the occultist learns to contact one additional outsider of the same type or a different type. Although he can call only one outsider in this way at a time, the occultist can ask such an outsider one additional question per calling for every 4 occultist levels he possesses beyond 8th (to a maximum of four questions at 20th level), all for the same bargaining price. The questions must be in some way related to one another.</p><p>At 16th level, in lieu of asking questions, the occultist can demand that the outsider deliver a message to any one friendly creature that the occultist knows personally. The occultist can also task the outsider to deliver one object weighing no more than 1 pound. Either of these demands requires an opposed check as described above. Delivery typically takes 1d4 hours, but this period is reduced to 1d6 minutes if the recipient is within 1 mile of the occultist (or even less if the recipient is within sight). The occultist must be able to accurately describe the recipient in both name and appearance. This ability can't be used to deliver anything to a location, or to enemies or creatures that are unfriendly to the occultist.</p><p><b>Binding Circles (Su)</b>: At 12th level, whenever the occultist creates a magic circle he can expend 1 additional point of mental focus to make it a binding circle. A binding circle is invisible and counts as a trap. If a living creature of the corresponding alignment steps inside it, the trap triggers and binds the creature inside the circle. While it can move freely within the circle, it can't leave the circle, make attacks against targets outside the circle, cast spells that cross the circle's boundary (the circle blocks line of effect from the inside), or use any ability that would allow it to leave the circle or disturb the circle in any way. When the circle traps a creature in this way, the creature can attempt a Reflex save to dive out of the circle before the magic takes hold (DC = 10 + 1/2 the occultist's level + the occultist's Intelligence modifier). A creature that can see the circle gains a +4 bonus on this save. If it fails its save, the creature must remain in the circle, although it can attempt a Will save at the same DC at the end of each hour of imprisonment to escape. A binding circle can be spotted with a successful Perception check (DC = 25 + 1/2 the occultist's level). It can also be disarmed using Disable Device, with the same DC. Anything crossing the boundary of the circle from the outside, such as a weapon, spell effect, or special ability, immediately breaks the circle and frees the creature trapped inside.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Fast Circles (Su)</b>: At 16th level, the occultist learns to draw magic circles very quickly. He can draw a magic circle as a full-round action, but any circle drawn in this way has a duration of 1 minute per occultist level (unless it's drawn in conjunction with the outside contact class feature, in which case it lasts for 10 minutes as normal). If he draws a binding circle in this way, its duration is 1 round per occultist level.</p><p><b>Implement Mastery (Su)</b>: At 20th level, an occultist learns to master one of his implements. He selects one implement school. Whenever he uses a focus power from an implement of that school, the DC to resist any of the effects increases by 4 and he treats his occultist level as 4 higher when determining the effects and duration of that power.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>In addition, the occultist gains 4 extra points of mental focus, but these points must always be invested in implements of the mastered school. He can't save these points or expend them for any ability other than the focus powers of those implements. The hardness of each of the occultist's implements of the mastered school increases by an additional 20 as long as the item has at least 1 point of mental focus stored within.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1occultclasses\">^Occult Classes</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypes\">Archetypes</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"XjOGD0eKurlj5EFC"}

These are not entirely new skills, but rather new uses of existing skills for those trained in the occult arts. A character must be trained in the appropriate skill to use that skill's unlock, even if the skill can normally be used untrained. It's impossible to take 10 for an occult skill unlock. Occult skill unlocks require intense concentration and strenuous effort, so the amount a character can use each skill unlock is limited to once per day or per week. This limit is for all uses of the skill unlock; if a character uses hypnotism to implant a suggestion, he can't also use it to recall memories on the same day.</p><p>This section describes each new skill unlock and the typical DCs and modifiers for associated checks. Some new types of gear in this book (starting on page 248) grant bonuses on specific occult skill unlocks.</p><h1>Automatic Writing (Linguistics)</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>You can produce mysterious writing that pertains to the immediate future, either under the influence of enigmatic guiding spirits or by unleashing your subconscious intuition.</p><p><b>Check</b>: Once per week, you can spend 1 hour posing questions while your hand unconsciously scribbles messages of varying legibility and accuracy. At the end of this hour, you attempt a Linguistics check to decipher the meanings of these messages. If successful, you gain information as though you had used <i>augury. </i>If you have 10 or more ranks in Linguistics, you can attempt a higher DC check to instead gain information as though you had used <i>divination</i>. The chance of successfully producing coherent or meaningful writing from any of these effects equals 60% plus 5% for every 1 by which your check result exceeds the DC (to a maximum of 90%). You must choose which DC you'll try to meet before attempting the check. The GM rolls the check and d% roll secretly, so that you can't tell whether the messages are accurate.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Writing Results</b></td><td><b>Ranks Required</b></td><td><b>DC</b></td></tr><tr><td>As <i>augury </i>spell</td><td>1</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>As <i>divination </i>spell</td><td>10</td><td>30</td></tr></table></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Action</b>: Automatic writing takes 1 hour.</p><p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes. You can attempt to learn more about a subject, but can still attempt only one check per week.</p><h1>Dowsing (Survival)</h1><p>You channel mysterious forces in the nearby environment to locate hidden resources.</p><p><b>Check</b>: Once per day, you can follow a dowsing rod's movements to locate a particular type of location. Each attempt requires 10 minutes of intense concentration, after which you attempt the Survival check with the DC listed on the table below. The maximum range at which you can detect anything using dowsing is 400 feet + 40 feet per rank in Survival you possess. The rod's directions persist for up to 10 minutes. You choose a particular target each time you dowse, and get the following information on a successful check.</p><p><i>Find Water</i>: The dowsing rod points toward the largest source of fresh water within range, including aquifers, lakes, ponds, and springs.</p><p><i>Grave Dowsing</i>: The dowsing rod points in the direction of the largest burial site, cairn, or tomb within range.</p><p><i>Locate Metal and Gems</i>: You concentrate on a specific metal or mineral. On a successful check, the dowsing rod points to the largest quantity of the selected mineral within range.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Dowsing Target</b></td><td><b>DC</b></td></tr><tr><td>Water</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Grave</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Mineral</td><td>25</td></tr></table></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Action</b>: Dowsing attempts take 10 minutes to initiate. The results of the check persist for 10 minutes afterward.</p><p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes. You can try to dowse from the same location more than once, but still only once per day.</p><h1>Faith Healing (Heal)</h1><p>You apply esoteric principles to temporarily suspend or remove curses, diseases, and ability damage.</p><p><b>Check</b>: You can use faith healing once per day. The DC and effect of the Heal check depend on the task you attempt. You can't use faith healing on yourself.</p><p><i>Restore Vitality</i>: You suppress ability damage. You perform a 1-hour ceremony, after which you attempt a Heal check against the DC of the effect that caused the ability damage. If you succeed at the check, you temporarily suppress 1 point of ability damage for 1 hour, plus 1 additional point and hour for every 5 by which the check result exceeds the DC. A creature can benefit from this treatment no more than once per day.</p><p><i>Suspend Affliction</i>: You treat one curse, disease, or poison affecting a creature. You enter into a deep trance for 1 hour while you treat the subject, after which you attempt your Heal check. If the check is successful, you suspend the effects of the affliction by 1 hour, plus 1 hour for every 5 by which you exceed the DC. This time doesn't count against the effect's duration (if any). The affliction can still be cured by other means while it's suspended.</p><p><i>Remove Affliction: </i>You can attempt to permanently remove an affliction in an 8-hour ceremony, after which you attempt a Heal check. If the result of the check is at least double the DC of the original affliction, the sufferer can attempt another saving throw using the original DC to permanently cast off the effect.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Task</b></td><td><b>DC</b></td></tr><tr><td>Restore vitality</td><td>Effect's save DC</td></tr><tr><td>Suspend affliction</td><td>Affliction's save DC</td></tr><tr><td>Remove affliction</td><td>Double the affliction's save DC</td></tr></table></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Action</b>: Restoring vitality and suspending afflictions each require 1 hour in a quiet environment. Permanent removal of afflictions requires 8 hours of heavy activity.</p><p><b>Try Again</b>: Varies. A creature can't be the subject of faith healing more than once per day. You can't try to permanently remove an affliction again.</p><h1>Hypnotism (Diplomacy)</h1><p>You use the power of suggestion and subtle psychic influence to alter a subject's mind and dredge up repressed memories.</p><p><b>Check</b>: You can use hypnotism once per day. The DC of a Diplomacy check to hypnotize is 20 + the subject's Will save modifier against mind-affecting enchantment (compulsion) effects. All uses of hypnotism are mind-affecting enchantment (compulsion) effects.</p><p><i>Implant Suggestion</i>: You can implant a suggested course of reasonable action in the mind of a willing creature, along with a defined trigger. To implant a suggestion, you spend 1 minute inducing a trance-like state in the subject, after which you attempt a Diplomacy check. If the check is successful, you implant the course of action, as a <i>suggestion </i>spell with a duration of 10 minutes plus 10 additional minutes for every 1 by which your check result exceeds the DC. If the subject ceases to be willing, it can attempt a Will save once each round to shake off the effects. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma modifier. You can attempt to subtly implant a suggestion in the mind of an unwilling creature with an attitude of indifferent or better after 1 minute of continuous, calm interaction with that creature, but the DC is 10 higher.</p><p><i>Recall Memory</i>: You can draw out forgotten memories from a willing subject. You spend 1 minute inducing a calming, trance-like state in the subject, after which you attempt a</p><p>Diplomacy check. If you succeed at the check, the hypnotized creature can reroll any previously failed Intelligence or Knowledge check to recall the forgotten information with a +4 bonus. The information must be something the subject once knew or was exposed to.</p><p><b>Action</b>: Hypnotism takes 1 minute of calm interaction.</p><p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes. You can try to hypnotize the same creature more than once, but only once per day.</p><h1>Phrenology (Knowledge [Arcana])</h1><p>You examine the skulls of intelligent creatures to analyze the subjects' psychological attributes, since the shape of the brain influences the shape of the skull.</p><p><b>Check</b>: Once per day, you can use your fingertips to examine the shape of a creature's skull. Reading a creature's skull requires 1 minute of concentration and scrutiny while you physically manipulate the skull. This technique can be used on a willing, helpless, or paralyzed creature, or on decomposed remains (as long as the skull is intact or can be pieced together). This skill can't be used on creatures without discernible skulls, such as constructs, elementals, oozes, or plants. After the minute is up, the GM attempts a secret Knowledge (arcana) check. The DC is typically modified by the subject's Hit Dice. With a single check, you determine all the information whose DC you meet. For instance, if you had a result of 22 when examining a creature with 2 HD, you would learn that creature's race and age, gender, alignment, and class, but not its level or HD.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Task</b></td><td><b>DC</b></td></tr><tr><td>Determine race and age</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Determine gender</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Determine alignment</td><td>15 + creature's HD*</td></tr><tr><td>Determine class</td><td>20 + creature's HD*</td></tr><tr><td>Determine level or HD</td><td>25 + creature's HD*</td></tr></table><p>* A dead creature's skull uses the HD the creature had when alive.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Action</b>: Reading a creature's cranium requires 1 minute of uninterrupted study.</p><p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes. Reexamining a skull may provide new insights. You can attempt only one such check per day.</p><h1>Prognostication (Sense Motive)</h1><p>You are skilled in means of folk divination. The most common methods are cartomancy (reading cards), cheiromancy (reading a creature's palms), crystallomancy (crystal-gazing), extispicy (reading animal entrails), horoscopy (reading a creature's birth stars), oneiromancy (interpreting dreams), osteomancy (reading cast bones), and pyromancy (reading flames).</p><p><b>Check</b>: Once per day, you can predict a creature's fortune for the near future. You spend 10 minutes interpreting the divination means at your disposal. The GM then attempts a secret Sense Motive check with a DC modified by the subject's Hit Dice (see the table below). The result of the check can give you basic insight into the subject's nature, including its alignment, class, and levels or Hit Dice, and might reveal clues to the creature's immediate future. Determining the immediate future as an <i>augury </i>spell has a chance of successfully interpreting meaningful readings equal to 60% plus 5% for every point by which the check result exceeds the DC (to a maximum of 90%). With a single check, you determine all the information whose DC you meet. For instance, if you had a result of 22 when telling the fortune of a creature with 2 HD, you would learn that creature's alignment and class, but not its level, HD, or fortune.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Task</b></td><td><b>DC</b></td></tr><tr><td>Determine alignment</td><td>15 + creature's HD</td></tr><tr><td>Determine class</td><td>20 + creature's HD</td></tr><tr><td>Determine level or HD</td><td>25 + creature's HD</td></tr><tr><td>Determine fortune as <i>augury </i>spell</td><td>25 + creature's HD</td></tr></table></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Action</b>: Reading a creature's fortune requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted contemplation, and the subject creature must be present.</p><p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes. You can attempt to read a particular creature's fortune repeatedly, but only once per 24 hours.</p><p><b>Special</b>: Specially crafted items purchased for the exclusive use of this skill grant a +2 circumstance bonus on Sense Motive checks to prognosticate.</p><h1>Psychometry (Appraise)</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>You can read the psychic impressions left on objects or in places by previous owners and events.</p><p><b>Check</b>: Once per day, you can concentrate for 1 minute while in physical contact with an item or location, during which you receive flashes of insight regarding the subject's nature and ownership. After 1 minute, you attempt a DC 15 Appraise check to decipher the visions. You gain one piece of information about the historical significance or the last previous owner-such as a glimpse of the last owner's appearance or its emotional state when it last used the item-determined by the GM.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>You learn one more piece of information for every 10 by which your check result exceeds the DC, as long as you concentrate for 1 additional minute for each piece of information. If you fail the check by less than 5 or the item has no significant psychic imprint, you don't learn any information. If you fail this check by 5 or more, the item appears to be psychically significant even if it's not, and the information you gain is wildly inaccurate.</p><p>If you attempt to use psychometry on an item affected by <i>charge object </i>or <i>implant false reading</i>, you automatically learn all information imprinted by the spell. You must also attempt a Will save. If the item is affected by an <i>implant false reading</i> spell, on a success, you realize the information was false, and can determine the true information as well. On a failure, or if the item is affected by a <i>charge object </i>spell, you believe the information is true.</p><p><b>Action</b>: Reading an object requires at least 1 minute of uninterrupted concentration.</p><p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes. Multiple readings on an object or place always give the same results unless its circumstances or ownership have changed, but additional checks might reach further back into an object's history. You don't reroll the saving throw to determine if a psychic imprint is false. You can still use psychometry only once per day.</p><h1>Read Aura (Perception)</h1><p>Your psychic sensitivity allows you to read the psychic and magical auras of creatures and objects.</p><p><b>Check</b>: Once per day, you can examine the natural aura of a creature or object to discern the subject's alignment, emotions, health, or magic. This requires 10 minutes of concentration, after which you attempt a Perception check. Each time, you must pick one of four auras to read: alignment, emotion, health, or magic. The result of the check applies only to the selected aura. You must be within 30 feet of the subject at all times during the reading. Objects typically have only magic auras, though some also have alignment auras (and intelligent items have emotion auras). You can still attempt to detect a type of aura an object doesn't have, but you get no results. The DC varies depending on the aura, as shown on the table.</p><p><i>Read Alignment Aura</i>: You attempt to read the alignment aura, learning the alignment and its strength. An alignment aura's strength depends on the creature's Hit Dice or item's caster level, as noted in the description of the <i>detect evil </i>spell.</p><p><i>Read Emotion Aura</i>: The colors within the target's aura reveal its emotional state. If successful, you learn the target's disposition and its attitude toward any creatures within 30 feet of it. For a number of rounds equal to the amount by which you exceeded the skill check's DC, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks against the target.</p><p><i>Read Health Aura</i>: Viewing the flow of vital force, you assess a creature's physical condition. You learn if the creature is unharmed or wounded, if it is poisoned or diseased, and whether it is affected by any of the following conditions: confused, disabled, dying, nauseated, panicked, staggered, stunned, and unconscious. You also learn the total number of points available in its ki pool, grit pool, or similar resource.</p><p><i>Read Magic Aura</i>: You attempt to determine the number and power of all magical auras on a target creature or object (see <i>detect magic </i>to determine a magic aura's power). If the check is successful, you can attempt Knowledge (arcana) or Spellcraft checks to determine the school or identify properties of a magic item, as normal. If the item is affected by <i>magic aura </i>or a similar spell, you can realize this and determine the actual properties of the item if your check result exceeds the DC by 5 or more. If the spell is of a higher level (such as <i>aura alteration</i>), increase this threshold DC by 2 for every spell level beyond 1st.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Task</b></td><td><b>DC</b></td></tr><tr><td>Read alignment aura</td><td>15 + creature's HD or item's caster level</td></tr><tr><td>Read emotion aura</td><td>20 + creature's HD or item's caster level*</td></tr><tr><td>Read health aura</td><td>15 + creature's HD</td></tr><tr><td>Read magic aura</td><td>20 + creature's HD or item's caster level</td></tr></table><p>* Intelligent items only.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Action</b>: Reading an aura requires 10 minutes of study.</p><p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes.

{"name":"Occult Rituals","permission":{"default":0,"JgpLZkPryhl1EFab":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_5ifacq93nyc","path":"Pathfinder RPG - Occult Adventures Reference Library#/CF_SEP/Occult Adventures#/CF_SEP/CHAPTER 5: OCCULT RULES","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\"></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>It's a common belief that only those initiated in the rites and practices of arcane, divine, or psychic magic can cast spells, but this is not strictly true. Hidden within dusty libraries and amid the ramblings of lunatics lie the mysteries of another form of spellcasting-occult ritual magic. These spells are rare, coveted by both those eager to gain their power and those wishing to hide their existence. Most traditional spellcasters consider these rituals dangerous and uncontrollable, something to be avoided or used as a last resort. They fear the power these ceremonies grant to the uninitiated, as the rituals allow those with only a glimmering of understanding the ability to interact with the underlying fabric of magic.</p><p>While anyone can attempt to cast occult rituals, the process is fraught with peril. The strange and intricate incantations are often challenging to perform with precision, and failure can weaken the casters or even unleash horrors upon the world. Even when successfully performed, each occult ritual has a price-a backlash that affects at least the caster leading the ritual, and often those assisting in its performance.</p><h1>CASTING OCCULT RITUALS</h1><p>Before performing an occult ritual, the primary caster must assemble and ready all the components needed as well as any secondary casters. Some occult rituals require the casting to occur at a specific time or place; attempting to cast such rituals at a different time or a substandard location is nearly impossible.</p><p>Casting an occult ritual requires at least 10 minutes per ritual level and sometimes as long as 1 hour per ritual level. One of the casters-either the primary caster or a secondary caster who the primary caster specifies- attempts one of the skill checks required by the ritual every 10 minutes of the casting, unless the ritual takes 1 hour per caster level, in which case the caster attempts the check every hour of the ritual. These checks cannot benefit from the aid another action, and the caster attempting the check can't take 10 or take 20, even if she has an ability that would normally allow her to do so when threatened or distracted. Furthermore, because of the specific procedures of ritual casting, mundane equipment that grants bonuses on skill checks can't usually increase the caster's bonus on the checks required by the ritual, unless the GM allows it. Bonuses on the skill checks required for the ritual that are granted by feats, spells (with enough duration to last throughout the casting), traits, and magic items usually apply, at the GM's discretion. The primary caster decides the order in which the various skill checks are attempted, but the GM rolls for the checks and tracks the progress of the ritual casting in secret. Once a ritual casting begins, it must be performed to its completion unless it's disrupted by outside influences or fails.</p><p>The primary caster leads a ritual's casting, often with the aid of a number of secondary casters. Secondary casters can be indispensable to the ritual's casting even when they're not taking an active role in ensuring its success. Unless stated otherwise in the ritual description, secondary casters must be within 100 feet and line of effect of the primary caster and each other during the entirety of a ritual's casting.</p><p>If a ritual allows the participation of secondary casters, in such cases, the ritual's Components line includes \"SC\" (\"secondary casters\") as an entry, immediately followed by a parenthetical that details any maximum or minimum number of secondary casters required to cast the ritual. If a ritual description has no secondary caster entry, that ritual does not permit the assistance of secondary casters. While secondary casters can help by attempting the skill checks the primary caster assigns them, their chief purpose is to aid in the ritual's casting. If a ritual's casting is aided by at least four secondary casters, all casters gain a +1 bonus on all skill checks attempted as part of casting the occult ritual. This bonus increases by 1 for every four secondary casters beyond four (up to a maximum bonus of +5 for 20 or more secondary casters).</p><p>To cast an occult ritual, the primary caster must learn the ritual's secrets (see Discovering Occult Rituals on page 209). Secondary casters can assist in the casting without fully understanding the intricacies of the ritual.</p><p>Since it is possible for those lacking the ability to cast arcane, divine, or psychic spells to cast rituals, variables that would normally rely on caster level (such as range and spell resistance) use the character level or total Hit Dice of the primary caster instead. This is the case even for a ritual caster who has the ability to cast spells. Characters with a caster level gain a +1 bonus on skill checks to cast a ritual, and this bonus increases by 1 for every 5 caster levels they possess (to a maximum of +5 at caster level 20th) as their understanding of the fundamentals of magic grows.</p><p>It's difficult to disrupt a ritual. Casting a ritual does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and the casters can pause the ritual to engage in combat or take other actions-though not without consequences. For each round an occult ritual is paused in this way, the DC of all the ritual's subsequent skill checks increases by 1. For practical purposes, a ritual is successfully disrupted when its casting is paused for more than 1 minute or any of the casters are incapacitated, killed, or moved more than 100 feet from (or out of line of effect of ) all other casters.</p><p>If more than half the skill checks for an occult ritual are successful, the ritual succeeds, and the primary caster (and the secondary casters if specified) experiences the ritual's backlash before the ritual's effect occurs. The DC for a saving throw against a ritual's effects (if applicable) is equal to 10 + the ritual level + the primary caster's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma bonus (whichever is highest).</p><p>If the casters fail half of the skill checks required for an occult ritual (rounded down), the ritual ends, the casters also experience the ritual's backlash, and the failure consequences occur. The consequences of failure are detailed in each ritual's description.</p><h1>DISCOVERING OCCULT RITUALS</h1><p>The mysteries of occult rituals are jealously guarded secrets, often painstakingly obscured by a ritual's originators or those who stumbled upon the obscure formulae detailing it. The particulars of casting occult rituals are hidden within coded tomes, concealed in puzzles, or referenced only through allusions woven into esoteric tales. Recovering the casting method of an occult ritual can be an adventure within itself, something revealed by hallucinatory visions, coerced from an occult practitioner, or passed on by a true initiate hovering at death's door and wishing for his genius to live beyond his mortal existence.</p><p>If an occult ritual is taught or its secrets are explained directly, it takes at least 1 day per ritual level to learn the method of its casting. Learning a ritual from hidden clues or from scratch takes a week or a month per ritual level (GM's discretion). At the end of this period of study and contemplation, the person attempting to learn the ritual must succeed at an Intelligence check (DC = 15 + the ritual level if learning from clues or a coerced teacher, or DC = 10 + the ritual level if learning from an instructor eager to teach). Failing the check means the secrets of the ritual elude the learner's understanding, though she can start the process anew at the same rate of potential discovery.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Tapping into Ley Lines</h1><p>A primary ritual caster with the ability to cast spells or use spell-like abilities can tap into a ley line (see page 232) within 30 feet by performing a simple ritual that takes 1 hour per 2 caster levels of the ley line. At the end of the ritual, the primary caster must succeed at a Spellcraft check (DC = 15 + the ley line's caster level) to attune herself with the ley line. If she fails, she can try the attunement ritual anew. On a successful check, the primary caster and any secondary casters gain a +1 bonus on skill checks to cast an occult ritual using the ley line, provided they remain within 30 feet of the ley line. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 caster levels of the ley line, to a maximum of +5. This form of attunement can be broken in the standard ways described in Using Ley Lines (see page 233).</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter5occultrules\">^Occult Rules</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter6runninganoccultgame\">Running an Occult Game</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"XyNkeE3YAkm7OWjy"}

following are the class features of the kineticist.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: Kineticists are proficient with all simple weapons and light armor, but not shields.</p><p><b>Elemental Focus (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a kineticist chooses one primary element on which to focus. This element determines how she accesses the raw power of the Ethereal Plane, and grants her access to specific wild talents (see below) and additional class skills. She can select aether (telekinesis), air (aerokinesis), earth (geokinesis), fire (pyrokinesis), or water (hydrokinesis). She gains her selected element's basic utility wild talent (basic telekinesis, basic aerokinesis, basic geokinesis, basic pyrokinesis, or basic hydrokinesis; see page 23) as a bonus wild talent. See Elements on page 14 for the specific abilities granted by each element.</p><p><b>Wild Talents</b>: A kineticist can use wild talents-magical abilities similar to spells but drawn from the kineticist's innate psychic talent and usable at will. Wild talents are typically spell-like abilities (though some are supernatural abilities), and take a standard action to use unless otherwise noted. A wild talent always has the elemental descriptor or descriptors (aether, air, earth, fire, or water) matching its Element entry. A wild talent that can be used with any of several elements gains the appropriate elemental descriptor when used with an element. For example, the wall wild talent gains the earth descriptor when used by a geokineticist.</p><p>Every wild talent has an effective spell level. A kineticist can always select 1st-level wild talents, but she can select a wild talent of a higher level only if her kineticist level is at least double the wild talent's effective spell level. Kinetic blast and defense wild talents are always considered to have an effective spell level equal to 1/2 the kineticist's class level (to a maximum effective spell level of 9th at kineticist level 18th).</p><p>Unless otherwise noted, the DC for a saving throw against a wild talent is equal to 10 + the wild talent's effective spell level + the kineticist's Constitution modifier. The kineticist uses her Constitution modifier on all concentration checks for wild talents.</p><p>In addition to the wild talents she gains from her other class features, at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a kineticist selects a new utility wild talent from the list of options available to her. A kineticist can select only universal wild talents or those that match her element (see Elemental Focus above). At 6th, 10th, and 16th levels, a kineticist can replace one of her utility wild talents with another wild talent of the same level or lower. She can't replace a wild talent that she used to qualify for another of her wild talents.</p><p><b>Burn (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a kineticist can overexert herself to channel more power than normal, pushing past the limit of what is safe for her body by accepting burn. Some of her wild talents allow her to accept burn in exchange for a greater effect, while others require her to accept a certain amount of burn to use that talent at all. For each point of burn she accepts, a kineticist takes 1 point of nonlethal damage per character level. This damage can't be healed by any means other than getting a full night's rest, which removes all burn and associated nonlethal damage. Nonlethal damage from burn can't be reduced or redirected, and a kineticist incapable of taking nonlethal damage can't accept burn. A kineticist can accept only 1 point of burn per round. This limit rises to 2 points of burn at 6th level, and rises by 1 additional point every 3 levels thereafter. A kineticist can't choose to accept burn if it would put her total number of points of burn higher than 3 + her Constitution modifier (though she can be forced to accept more burn from a source outside her control). A kineticist who has accepted burn never benefits from abilities that allow her to ignore or alter the effects she receives from nonlethal damage.</p><p><b>Kinetic Blast (Sp)</b>: At 1st level, a kineticist gains a kinetic blast wild talent of her choice. This kinetic blast must be a simple blast that matches her element. As a standard action, the kineticist can unleash a kinetic blast at a single target up to a range of 30 feet. She must have at least one hand free to aim the blast (or one prehensile appendage, if she doesn't have hands). All damage from a kinetic blast is treated as magic for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. Kinetic blasts count as a type of weapon for the purpose of feats such as Weapon Focus. The kineticist is never considered to be wielding or gripping the kinetic blast (regardless of effects from form infusions; see Infusion on page 12), and she can't use Vital Strike feats with kinetic blasts. Even the weakest kinetic blast involves a sizable mass of elemental matter or energy, so kinetic blasts always deal full damage to swarms of any size (though only area blasts deal extra damage to swarms). A readied kinetic blast can be used to counterspell any spell of equal or lower level that shares its descriptor. A kinetic blast that deals energy damage of any type (including force) has the corresponding descriptor.</p><p>The various kinetic blasts, as well as additional rules for simple blasts, are described on pages 15-16.</p><p><b>Gather Power (Su)</b>: If she has both hands free (or all of her prehensile appendages free, for unusual kineticists), a kineticist can gather energy or elemental matter as a move action. Gathering power creates an extremely loud, visible display in a 20-foot radius centered on the kineticist, as the energy or matter swirls around her. Gathering power in this way allows the kineticist to reduce the total burn cost of a blast wild talent she uses in the same round by 1 point. The kineticist can instead gather power for 1 full round in order to reduce the total burn cost of a blast wild talent used on her next turn by 2 points (to a minimum of 0 points). If she does so, she can also gather power as a move action during her next turn to reduce the burn cost by a total of 3 points. If the kineticist takes damage during or after gathering power and before using the kinetic blast that releases it, she must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 10 + damage taken + effective spell level of her kinetic blast) or lose the energy in a wild surge that forces her to accept a number of points of burn equal to the number of points by which her gathered power would have reduced the burn cost. This ability can never reduce the burn cost of a wild talent below 0 points.</p><p><b>Infusion (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a kineticist gains an infusion wild talent from the list of options available based on her elemental focus. She gains additional infusions at 3rd, 5th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 17th, and 19th levels. By using infusions along with her kinetic blasts, a kineticist can alter her kinetic blasts to suit her needs. Infusions come in two types, each of which changes a kinetic blast differently: a substance infusion causes an additional effect, while a form infusion causes the kinetic blast to manifest in a different way. Each infusion can alter only certain kinds of kinetic blasts, which are listed in its Associated Blasts entry. Each time the kineticist uses one of her kinetic blast wild talents, she can apply up to one associated form infusion and up to one associated substance infusion. Some infusions change the action required to activate a kinetic blast or entirely transform the kinetic blast's normal effects. The burn cost listed in each infusion's Burn entry is added to the burn cost of the kinetic blast the infusion modifies.</p><p>The DC for a save against an infusion is based on the associated kinetic blast's effective spell level, not the level of the infusion. The DCs for form infusions are calculated using the kineticist's Dexterity modifier instead of her Constitution modifier. When a kineticist modifies a kinetic blast with a form infusion and a substance infusion that both require saving throws, each target first attempts a saving throw against the form infusion. If a target succeeds and a successful save negates the infusion's effects, the entire kinetic blast is negated; otherwise, the target then attempts a saving throw against the substance infusion. If a kineticist's form and substance infusions both alter the kinetic blast's damage, apply the substance infusion's alteration first.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>At 5th, 11th, and 17th levels, a kineticist can replace one of her infusions with another infusion of the same effective spell level or lower. She can't replace an infusion that she used to qualify for another of her wild talents.</p><p>The descriptions of infusions begin on page 17.</p><p><b>Elemental Defense (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, a kineticist gains her element's defense wild talent ( the descriptions of defense wild talents begin on page 16).</p><p><b>Elemental Overflow (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, a kineticist's body surges with energy from her chosen element whenever she accepts burn, causing her to glow with a nimbus of fire, weep water from her pores, or experience some other thematic effect. In addition, she receives a bonus on her attack rolls with kinetic blasts equal to the total number of points of burn she currently has, to a maximum bonus of +1 for every 3 kineticist levels she possesses.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>She also receives a bonus on damage rolls with her kinetic blast equal to double the bonus on attack rolls. The kineticist can suppress the visual effects of elemental overflow by concentrating for 1 full round, but doing so suppresses all of this ability's other benefits, as well. The next time the kineticist uses any wild talent, the visual effects and benefits return instantly.</p><p>As a kineticist's body becomes more and more suffused with her element, she begins to gain more powerful benefits. Starting at 6th level, whenever she has at least 3 points of burn, the kineticist gains a +2 size bonus to two physical ability scores of her choice. She also gains a chance to ignore the effects of a critical hit or sneak attack equal to 5% x her current number of points of burn. At 11th level, whenever the kineticist has at least 5 points of burn, these bonuses increase to a +4 size bonus to one physical ability score of her choice and a +2 size bonus to each of her other two physical ability scores. At 16th level, whenever the kineticist has at least 7 points of burn, these bonuses increase to a +6 size bonus to one physical ability score of her choice, a +4 size bonus to a second physical ability score of her choice, and a +2 size bonus to the remaining physical ability score.</p><p><b>Infusion Specialization (Ex)</b>: At 5th level, whenever a kineticist uses one or more infusions with a blast, she reduces the combined burn cost of the infusions by 1. This can't reduce the total cost of the infusions used below 0. She reduces the burn cost by 1 additional point at 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 20th levels.</p><p><b>Metakinesis (Su)</b>: At 5th level, a kineticist gains the ability to alter her kinetic blasts as if with metamagic feats by accepting burn. By accepting 1 point of burn, she can empower her kinetic blast (as if using Empower Spell). At 9th level, by accepting 2 points of burn, she can maximize her kinetic blast as if using Maximize Spell. At 13th level, by accepting 3 points of burn, she can quicken her kinetic blast as if using Quicken Spell. At 17th level, by accepting 4 points of burn, the kineticist can use her kinetic blast twice with the same standard action, or swift action if she also uses metakinesis to quicken the blast. When she uses a double kinetic blast, all modifications, such as metakinesis and infusions, apply to both of the blasts, but the kineticist needs to pay the burn cost only once.</p><p><b>Internal Buffer (Su)</b>: At 6th level, a kineticist's study of her body and the elemental forces that course through it allow her to form an internal buffer to store extra energy. The buffer starts empty and doesn't replenish each day, but the kineticist can accept 1 point of burn to add 1 point to the buffer as a full-round action, to a maximum of 1 point total. This maximum increases to 2 points at 11th level and to 3 points at 16th level. Once the kineticist adds points to her buffer, they remain indefinitely until she spends them. When she would otherwise accept burn, a kineticist can spend 1 point from her buffer to avoid accepting 1 point of burn. She cannot spend more than 1 point from her buffer in this way for a single wild talent. Points spent from the internal buffer don't activate elemental overflow or add to its effects. Similarly, this buffer can be used to exceed the limit on the number of points of burn the kineticist can accept in a single turn.</p><p><b>Expanded Element (Su)</b>: At 7th level, a kineticist learns to use another element or expands her understanding of her own element. She can choose any element, including her primary element. She gains one of that element's simple blast wild talents that she does not already possess, if any. She also gains all composite blast wild talents whose prerequisites she meets, as well as the basic wild talent of her chosen expanded element (for instance, basic aerokinesis if she chooses air). See Composite Blasts on page 15 for additional rules for and descriptions of composite blasts. She doesn't gain the defense wild talent of the expanded element.</p><p>If the kineticist's expanded element is different from her primary element, she treats her kineticist level as 4 levels lower for the purpose of determining which wild talents she can learn from her expanded element.</p><p>If the kineticist chooses to expand her understanding of an element she already has, she gains an additional utility wild talent or infusion of her choice from that element, as if from her infusion or wild talent class feature, as appropriate.</p><p>At 15th level, the kineticist can either select a new element or expand her understanding of her original element. She can't select the same element she selected at 7th level unless it is her primary element. She gains all the benefits from her new expanded element as listed above. However, if the kineticist selected her primary element as her expanded element at both 7th and 15th levels, her mastery of that element increases. For wild talents of her element, the kineticist gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls, as well as to caster level and DCs.</p><p><b>Supercharge (Su)</b>: At 11th level, when using gather power as a move action, a kineticist can reduce the total burn cost of a single wild talent by 2 points instead of 1. When using gather power for 1 full round, she can reduce the burn cost of a single wild talent by 3 points instead of 2.</p><p><b>Composite Specialization (Su)</b>: At 16th level, a kineticist becomes more adept at creating composite blasts. She reduces the burn cost of all composite blasts by 1 point. This can't reduce the cost of a composite blast below 0 points.</p><p><b>Metakinetic Master (Su)</b>: At 19th level, a kineticist chooses one type of metakinesis, such as empower or quicken. She reduces the burn cost of that metakinesis by 1 point (to a minimum of 0 points).</p><p><b>Omnikinesis (Su)</b>: At 20th level, a kineticist transcends the distinction between the different elements and can bend all creation to her will. By accepting 1 point of burn (in addition to any burn requirement of the kinetic blast she chooses), she can use any blast wild talent she doesn't know. By accepting 1 point of burn as a standard action, she can change any of her wild talents into any other wild talent of the same category (such as simple blasts or defense) for 24 hours, ignoring any elemental requirements or restrictions (but not any other requirements or restrictions).</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1occultclasses\">^Occult Classes</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypes\">Archetypes</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"YWkMd5fTOGdUR1WH"}
{"name":"Racial Favored Class Options","permission":{"default":0,"JgpLZkPryhl1EFab":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_xwkwe74aoze","path":"Pathfinder RPG - Occult Adventures Reference Library#/CF_SEP/Occult Adventures#/CF_SEP/CHAPTER 1: OCCULT CLASSES","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\"></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>The rules below allow members of races from the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook </i>to take alternate rewards when they gain a level in a favored class chosen from among the classes in this book. The racial favored class options listed in <i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide </i>cover the classes from the <i>Core Rulebook</i>, <i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide</i>, <i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat</i>, and <i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic</i>. Such options for the classes presented in the <i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide </i>are covered in that volume.</p><p>Each of these rewards replaces the normal reward for having a level in a favored class (gaining 1 extra hit point or 1 extra skill rank). Unlike those general rewards, the alternate favored class options speak directly to the features of specific classes and the general tendencies of various races.</p><p>Whenever you gain a level in a favored class, you can choose which favored class option you take. Unless otherwise noted, these benefits always stack with themselves.</p><p>Many of these alternate class rewards add only 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, or 1/6 to a roll (rather than 1) each time the reward is selected, or add 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, or 1/6 to a class ability (such as adding to a mesmerist's number of mesmerist tricks per day or the total number of points in a psychic's phrenic pool). When applying such a benefit to a die roll or class ability, always round down (to a minimum of 0). You may thus need to select such an option several times before the benefit takes effect. If an alternate favored class option modifies a class feature or ability, it can't be taken before the character has that class feature or ability. For example, if a class gains a class feature at 6th level, a character couldn't take a racial favored class option that applies to that class feature until 6th level, even if the benefit from that option wouldn't be high enough to add a bonus until a later level.</p><p>Some options may have a fixed numerical limit, after which selecting that favored class reward again has no effect. In these cases, you can always select from among the standard rewards when taking a level in a favored class (gaining 1 extra hit point or 1 extra skill rank).</p><p>Abilities from favored class options that increase a character's caster level for the purpose of determining the duration of certain spells apply this increase after other effects that adjust a spell's duration, such as Extend Spell.</p><h1>DWARVES</h1><p>Some dwarven communities place a social stigma on psychic abilities due to the association of such powers with their slaver cousins, the duergar. Occultists avoid this stigma by establishing a connection to the storied relics of dwarven history. Dwarven spiritualists might connect with spirits of dwarves who fell in battle, and dwarven mediums might hone their talents so they can contact the great heroes of dwarven lore. Still, the most common path for a psychic dwarf is a kineticist focusing on earth and metal wild talents. The following options are open to all dwarves who have the listed favored class.</p><p><b>Kineticist</b>: Add 1/3 point of damage to earth element blasts that deal damage.</p><p><b>Medium</b>: Gain a +1/2 bonus on saving throws against possession and a +1/2 bonus on saving throws to end haunt channeler, location channel, and spacious soul.</p><p><b>Mesmerist</b>: Increase painful stare's damage by 1/4 point.</p><p><b>Occultist</b>: Gain a +1/3 bonus on Appraise and Use Magic Device checks involving stone and metal objects.</p><p><b>Psychic</b>: When casting psychic abjuration spells, add 1/2 level to the effective caster level of the spell, but only to determine the spell's duration.</p><p><b>Spiritualist</b>: Add 1/6 to the shield bonus granted by the 3rd-level ectoplasmic bonded manifestation ability.</p><h1>ELVES</h1><p>The same keen intellects and careful study elves use to explore the arcane arts also apply to their study of the occult and psychic magic. Elves who explore their own psyches typically embark on mental expeditions after thorough study of psychic phenomena. They approach their own minds deliberately, keeping detailed chronicles of what they experience both without and within. The following options are open to all elves who have the listed favored class.</p><p><b>Kineticist</b>: Gain a +1/4 bonus on damage rolls that apply the kineticist's elemental overflow bonus.</p><p><b>Medium</b>: Gain a +1/3 bonus on all skill checks using occult skill unlocks.</p><p><b>Mesmerist</b>: Gain a +1/2 bonus on Acrobatics checks to move through a threatened area and a +1/2 bonus on Bluff checks to feint.</p><p><b>Occultist</b>: Increase the occultist's total number of points of mental focus by 1/2 point.</p><p><b>Psychic</b>: Increase the total number of points in the psychic's phrenic pool by 1/3 point.</p><p><b>Spiritualist</b>: Add 1/6 to the shield bonus granted by the 3rd-level ectoplasmic bonded manifestation ability.</p><h1>GNOMES</h1><p>Mental trickery comes naturally to gnomes. They're predisposed to like psychic magic, with its off beat and obscure practices. Each type of occult class holds its own appeal for gnomes, from the kineticist's innate feel for magic to the occultist's fascination with trinkets. The following options are open to all gnomes who have the listed favored class.</p><p><b>Kineticist</b>: Gain a +1/2 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive skill checks against creatures with the elemental subtype matching the kineticist's primary element.</p><p><b>Medium</b>: Gain a +1/2 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive skill checks against spirits, undead, phantoms, and creatures native to the Astral Plane.</p><p><b>Mesmerist</b>: Increase the number of mesmerist tricks the mesmerist can use per day by 1/3.</p><p><b>Occultist</b>: Increase the duration of the occultist's minor figment by 1 minute, and increase the total concealment miss chance from the occultist's distortion resonant power by 2%. This doesn't increase the maximum miss chance.</p><p><b>Psychic</b>: Increase the total number of points in the psychic's phrenic pool by 1/3 point.</p><p><b>Spiritualist</b>: Add 1/6 to the shield bonus granted to the spiritualist while under the effects of either spiritual interference or greater spiritual interference.</p><h1>HALF-ELVES</h1><p>Many half-elves have a talent for forming and reinforcing social ties, and psychic half-elves find that mentally connecting to other creatures makes this even easier. They're especially skilled at the spiritual communication required for the medium class. Half-elves who hew more closely to their elven lineage often become psychics, and those with stronger human blood might become kineticists or mesmerists. The following options are open to all half-elves who have the listed favored class.</p><p><b>Kineticist</b>: Gain a +1/4 bonus on damage rolls that apply the kineticist's elemental overflow bonus.</p><p><b>Medium</b>: Gain a +1/3 bonus on all skill checks using occult skill unlocks.</p><p><b>Mesmerist</b>: When casting mesmerist enchantment spells, add 1/2 to the effective caster level of the spell, but only to determine the spell's duration.</p><p><b>Occultist</b>: Gain a +1/2 bonus on Spellcraft checks to identify the properties of magic items and a +1/2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks to emulate a race.</p><p><b>Psychic</b>: Gain 1/6 of a new phrenic amplification.</p><p><b>Spiritualist</b>: Add 1 skill rank to the spiritualist's phantom.</p><h1>HALF-ORCS</h1><p>Abilities firmly rooted in the mind might not seem like a fit for half-orcs-at least, according to the common perception of half-orcs. However, psychic abilities sometimes get handed down, typically from a human parent. When orc blood contributes psychic talent, it usually manifests as kineticist abilities. The following options are open to all half-orcs who have the listed favored class.</p><p><b>Kineticist</b>: Add 1/3 point of fire damage to fire-element blasts that deal fire damage.</p><p><b>Medium</b>: When gaining a taboo, the medium can use spirit surge without incurring influence an additional 1/4 time per day.</p><p><b>Mesmerist</b>: Increase the mesmerist's bonus damage from painful stare by 1/2 point.</p><p><b>Occultist</b>: Deal an additional 1/2 point of damage with focus powers.</p><p><b>Psychic</b>: Gain a +1 bonus on concentration checks required because of taking damage while casting spells from the psychic class.</p><p><b>Spiritualist</b>: Add 1 hit point to the spiritualist's phantom.</p><h1>HALFLINGS</h1><p>It's a common belief that half lings get out of scrapes because of their good fortune, but for some, \"half ling luck\" is really a reflection of psychic talent. Many develop this ability into something greater to compensate for their small stature, and become particularly adept at influencing or manipulating people. The following options are open to all half lings who have the listed favored class.</p><p><b>Kineticist</b>: Increase the capacity of the kineticist's internal buffer by 1/6 point.</p><p><b>Medium</b>: Increase the bonus the medium gains from its seance boon by 1/3 point. This doesn't increase the bonus allies gain from shared seance.</p><p><b>Mesmerist</b>: Increase the number of mesmerist tricks the mesmerist can use per day by 1/3.</p><p><b>Occultist</b>: Add 1/2 point of mental focus per day.</p><p><b>Psychic</b>: The psychic treats her Charisma bonus as 1/3 point higher for the purpose of determining the number of uses or rounds per day of her discipline powers.</p><p><b>Spiritualist</b>: Add 1/4 to the number of rounds that the spiritualist's incorporeal phantom can be out of sight and line of effect before being sent back to the Ethereal Plane.</p><h1>HUMANS</h1><p>Lacking traditions on which to base their understanding of the occult, psychic humans often join strange cults to develop their mental talents. Others engage in private study, collecting writings of questionable veracity that cover occult topics. A large number of humans are fascinated with occult topics even if they aren't sensitive to psychic phenomena, and they can be quick to follow anyone who demonstrates even minor abilities with psychic magic. The following options are open to all humans who have the listed favored class.</p><p><b>Kineticist</b>: Gain 1/6 of an Extra Wild Talent feat.</p><p><b>Medium</b>: When gaining a taboo, the medium can use spirit surge without incurring influence an additional 1/4 time per day.</p><p><b>Mesmerist</b>: Increase the mesmerist's towering ego bonus by 1/3 point (to a maximum increase of +2).</p><p><b>Occultist</b>: Gain 1/6 of a new focus power.</p><p><b>Psychic</b>: Add one spell known from the psychic spell list. This spell must be at least 1 level lower than the highest spell level the psychic can cast.</p><p><b>Spiritualist</b>: Add 1 skill rank or 1 hit point to the spiritualist's phantom.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1occultclasses\">^Occult Classes</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypes\">Archetypes</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"YjZkNeVI8ZtKBKEc"}
{"name":"Running An Occult Game","permission":{"default":0,"JgpLZkPryhl1EFab":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_4751keynkw3","path":"Pathfinder RPG - Occult Adventures Reference Library#/CF_SEP/Occult Adventures#/CF_SEP/CHAPTER 6: RUNNING AN OCCULT GAME","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\"></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>The word \"occult\" refers to that which is hidden or occluded, and it encompasses a wide range of strange disciplines known to only a few. Ancient though they may be, the mysteries of the occult remain obscure, protected by hermetic orders or locked within esoteric repositories of knowledge.</p><p>In an occult adventure, the characters uncover clues as they search for the meaning behind perplexing events and supernatural phenomena. The tone is usually ominous and laden with secrecy and veiled threats as the characters untangle each portentous thread of occult mystery. Ordinary folk seldom recognize the patterns beneath events; only the truly initiated, undaunted by the risks to mind, body, and soul, dare plumb the depths of the occult in order to protect their world from unseen dangers.</p><h1>INCORPORATING THE OCCULT</h1><p>Incorporating occult themes into games where magic is commonplace requires careful consideration. Think of the occult like layers of an onion. By peeling back these layers one at a time, PCs can be at first perplexed by, then increasingly familiar with, the strange rules that govern this parallel world. But once PCs become comfortable with one occult reality, they discover a new deeper, darker layer.</p><p>In occult adventures, each new piece of the puzzle opens up more questions than it answers, and the mysteries of the story and plot are carefully nested like so many matryoshka dolls. In such games, haunts do not hesitate to reveal the causes for their spiritual contamination, and ritually marked corpses are far more than atmospheric window dressing. The very locations adventurers investigate may themselves be intrinsically linked by mysterious ley lines to other locations with similarly disturbing histories.</p><h1>OCCULT ELEMENTS</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>As characters in an occult campaign start to discover the hidden strands that connect seemingly unrelated events, they begin to interact with the bizarre, esoteric trappings of occult stories, including the following elements.</p><h1>Mysteries within Mysteries</h1><p>Standard adventures present a problem, obstacles in the form of monsters and traps, and a resolution. By comparison, occult adventures are subtler. The key to the adventurers' success often lies in investigating the unknown and the inexplicable, or following a trail of clues to its source. Strange phenomena, bizarre murders, and eerie occurrences are regular hooks in occult adventures, and the characters must peel away layer after layer to find the truth. The Mysteries and Investigations section on pages 246-247 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide </i>provides advice for structuring a mystery adventure; occult adventures use a similar structure, intermingled with the atmospheric clues and story trappings of the occult elements detailed in this chapter.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>This is not to say that an occult adventure can't also include heroic battles, dungeon exploration, or swashbuckling. It's a good idea to vary the tone and pacing of the campaign from time to time, and sometimes seemingly ominous portents can turn out to be red herrings, which have their own value in occult adventures.</p><p>The occult elements in your story might also fade in and out of a campaign with an altogether different main theme, recurring every few adventures as side treks that at first have little to do with one another-or so it would seem. The further the PCs progress in the campaign story, the more clearly they begin to distinguish the patterns underlying all of their adventures. For example, the PCs might discover that all of the unearthed graves they encountered throughout several adventures were the resting places of an order of scribes who penned a tome foretelling the apocalypse. When it's time to reintroduce the occult storyline, the GM need only present a fresh clue that ties back to earlier adventures to draw the characters once again into the world of the occult.</p><p><b>Piecemeal Mysteries</b>: Mystery adventures can be tricky to write, as the GM cannot always foresee when clues are too obvious or too obscure, and either case may be frustrating for the players. Bringing the occult into the campaign one small piece at a time creates the illusion of unseen forces moving in secret, even if neither the GM nor the players know the nature of the mystery at the beginning of the campaign. As the campaign progresses and more pieces fall into place, the mystery reveals itself and takes a definite shape.</p><p><b>Clues Only for the Initiated</b>: Game Masters often try to conceal vital information in games to preserve mysteries for fateful, well-timed reveals. And all too often, canny PCs find a way to acquire the information early, disrupting the GM's carefully planned adventure and spoiling its momentum through overreliance on a few choice clues. While such reticence may sometimes be necessary to preserve intrigue and guide PCs, occult games dole out information more readily and more frequently, but in a slightly different manner. Because the most significant clues in an occult mystery may be hard to even recognize as clues, such methods can not only more easily screen the key bits of information that do propel the plot forward, but also create a more mysterious atmosphere.</p><p><b>Red Herrings That Aren't</b>: Red herrings should not always be dead ends. Instead, they may serve to set up further adventures for the PCs, leaving them with the uneasy sense that strange events driven by bizarre, eldritch motivations are hidden in the world all around them. For example, while the PCs are on the trail of a murderous demon cult, misinformation might lead them to a secret society involved in unusual initiation rites. While the lead may be a dead end in terms of their original investigation, perhaps the PCs discover the group's seemingly innocuous initiations actually involve dangerous necromancy.</p><p><b>Building PC Involvement</b>: Sometimes the best way to involve the PCs in a campaign is to ask them what they want. At the beginning of your occult campaign, ask each player to come up with a personal mystery for his or her character, such as having witnessed an unusual phenomenon or having experienced an inexplicable event as a teenager. A PC may have brief flashbacks to her childhood of visits by men in blood-red robes and disturbing animal masks, for example. The character's search to discover the meaning of this memory may lead her down dark paths, particularly when she spots a street preacher wearing the tattered remains of one of the robes in a nearby city, and discovers from him that as a child, the PC was a candidate for an apocalyptic cult. Other hooks might include the unknown fate of a friend or relative, or the significance of a city monument's unconventional design. It may center on a certain location, like a place seen in recurring dreams or the ghost-haunted gardens of some overgrown manor. It could have to do with a mysterious object, such as a locket that throbs painfully in the hands of a psychometrist or an ancient tome containing twisting, backwards writing in which a new word is scribbled each day.</p><p>Some hooks may play major roles in the campaign, while others turn out to be minor anecdotes. Regardless, an adventure hook based on a character's curiosity, need, or longing is an invaluable tool for building player investment in the story.</p><h1>Unseen Realms</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>When running an occult game, consider replacing some of the NPCs who broker information with spirits, daemons, otherworldly entities, and mortals who traffic in the occult, such as a medium who channels spirits from a ramshackle wooden hut at the edge of a misty bog. Occult adventures emphasize the search for obscure, hidden knowledge beyond the ken of mortal minds. Such information is the province of spirits and lost souls who wander those rarely trod paths.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Some buildings may have mysterious symbols hidden in their architecture, or were designed to attract or channel occult power. For instance, adventurers who disturb the cairn of a powerful sorcerer might soon discover that the occult nature of the structure itself kept his soul in check. And, of course, GMs should design interconnected webs of intrigue that subtly display these patterns, daring PCs to pull the loose threads of reality and unravel all that they know, exposing the terrible secrets that lie beneath.</p><p>In a campaign steeped in occult lore and practice, spirits and demons might be the major quest-givers, regular allies, foils, or adversaries, and their machinations pull the PCs in multiple directions. They might all seem virtuous, or may all seem reprehensible, but they all want something, and they are willing to use the PCs as pawns to achieve it. An uncooperative angel may give the characters information only grudgingly, whereas a devil who wants something might be more forthcoming.</p><h1>The Power and Price of Knowledge</h1><p>The quest for knowledge features prominently in occult adventures. Knowledge and power invariably come at a price, however, even if the cost isn't immediately evident.</p><p>Calamity strikes when mortals rush blindly in, throwing open the doors to powers that they do not yet comprehend.</p><p>As the characters begin to perceive the occult world that surrounds them, consider the dreadful fates and terrible sacrifices that they might face as they immerse themselves ever deeper into the occult. The price of knowledge or power may seem cheap at first-the memory of a PC's first kiss or the smell of a spring rain-but in the end, these snippets of humanity are a terrible price to pay, and the characters' own desires or desperation may prove their undoing.</p><p>In the depths of the occult underworld, initiates barter for the true names of demon princes, exchange rare formulae for the creation of artificial life, and broker in corpses that conceal terrible secrets. Such mystical bargains are rarely fair trades of power, and hermetic orders and cults manipulate these exchanges to devalue the knowledge traded away and inflate the value of the knowledge earned.</p><h1>Strange Rules and Peculiar Patterns</h1><p>The behavior of occult denizens often falls into unusual patterns. As discussed above, these patterns often manifest in architecture, but they also show up as odd coincidences that have significance for occult investigators, such as corpses discovered in symbolic patterns. Occult creatures themselves are beings of eccentric habits, and PCs may exploit their patterns of behavior to expose or confront them, perhaps discovering the celestial alignments that must happen in order for some diabolical plan to finally come to fruition.</p><p>Knowledge of these strange rules and peculiar patterns often holds the key to an antagonist's defeat. In a typical mystery adventure, the GM might keep secret the means of causing a monster's demise. But occult knowledge could give investigating player characters unusual opportunities to learn more about their foes. Perhaps divinations or phrenological readings reveal multiple weaknesses characters could exploit, though not all of them are real, and some may even empower the antagonist. Ultimately, the only way to find out may be to encounter the antagonist directly, but putting the acquired knowledge to the test may be a more dangerous affair than the PCs initially realized.</p><h1>Fates Worse Than Death</h1><p>When death is final and unknown, it is as mysterious to living beings as it is terrifying. Characters accustomed to communicating with spirits, however, know that death is not the end. In fact, characters skilled in the occult might willingly wander the Ethereal Plane to quest, converse, and mingle among the bodiless spirits that reside there. In these games, characters usually have a pretty good idea of what fate awaits them, and what the final reward-or punishment-will be for their actions in life.</p><p>In occult adventures where characters can leave their bodies, travel in dreams, and project their forms onto the Astral Plane, the death of the physical body could come to hold less significance. Therefore, present the characters with fates worse than death. This might amount to a torturous \"living\" death, such as the eternal enslavement and torture of the soul or a debilitating madness that gradually renders a psychic creature mindless and insane. Since death in fantasy roleplaying games is typically either the end of a character's story or a small inconvenience before resurrection, look for ways to offer an escape from death using occult characters' knowledge of the spirit world-but at significant cost to their bodies, minds, or souls.</p><h1>Esoteric Atmosphere</h1><p>Setting the scene is important in occult adventures, which rely upon creating an eerie atmosphere of tension, dread, and wonder in the presence of the supernatural. GMs can use props and tools to create a physical atmosphere around their players that draws them in to the emotional realm of the adventure. A room illuminated by flickering candles suggests darkened seance chambers or occult rituals, and a prepared library of sounds and voices brings settings and characters to life. If the characters are occult initiates or psychics, or they consult a fortune-teller or a medium, consider using cards, crystals, talismans, talking boards, and other such items as props in those scenes (as described on pages 30- 31 of the <i>GameMastery Guide</i>). Challenge yourself to give the players goose bumps a few times over the course of your campaign.</p><h1>OCCULT THEMES</h1><p>The following campaign themes combine the elements of occult adventures in different ways, and are meant to serve as packages to help GMs open the door of the occult in their campaign worlds.</p><h1>The Occult Underworld</h1><p>The Unseen Realms and Strange Rules and Peculiar Patterns elements introduce an occult underworld that operates beneath the veneer of everyday life. Members of the occult underworld masquerade as the ordinary folk who occupy every stratum of society. In adventures that use this theme, an air of paranoia and dread looms as the characters investigate dark mysteries. No one is safe. No one can be trusted.</p><p>Not every secret society holds a dark agenda, however, and indeed some secret orders exist to oppose the machinations of evil cults. In time, the characters in an occult adventure might join such an order, or the party itself may come to be recognized as its own faction amongst the occult underworld.</p><p>Moving the antagonists' goals forward creates tension and a sense of urgency, and helps to motivate the characters. Even if the characters manage to anticipate the villains' every move, you can heighten the feeling of dark agendas running beneath the surface of your campaign by creating a list of minor, unrelated victories for the secret factions the characters oppose. Perhaps while the characters are distracted stopping a cult from transforming the city gates into a portal to Hell, elsewhere a smaller branch of the cult summons a powerful devil as the first step in another part of the cult leader's overarching plan.</p><p>Another way to impress the theme of a ubiquitous occult underworld upon the characters is to hit them close to home. Choose an important NPC dear to one of the characters to be a member of a secret society or a cult that the characters oppose. Consider the scenes in which your NPC has appeared and create an ulterior motive for the character within those scenes that advances the agenda of the secret society or cult to which the NPC belongs. Handled well, this character's motivations will seem clear to the PCs in hindsight, as if you had planned the betrayal from the beginning.</p><h1>Spiritual Warfare</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Occult elements such as Mysteries within Mysteries, The Price and Power of Knowledge, and Fates Worse Than Death can combine to create a powerful overriding campaign theme highlighting the struggle for dominance between the worlds of the living and the dead. The veils between the worlds are worn thin. Haunts, ghosts, and lost souls are commonplace, though they are not the true antagonists; in such campaigns, the real villains are often powerful outsiders with legions of minions who specialize in the harvesting of souls for a profitable black market in the nether realms. Spirits who seek rest are a common occurrence, and PCs are tasked with discovering the means to help the dead move on one way or another, either through completing tasks a soul left incomplete in life, or by laying the spirit to rest permanently through force of might. Stakes are high in such games, and death is never the end.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Into the Great Beyond</h1><p>GMs who explore the Power and Price of Knowledge and Unseen Realms elements will eventually reveal the presence of parallel realities to this Material Plane. Rather than venturing outward to distant lands, your occult adventurers might turn their focus inward to the strange realms of thoughts, dreams, spirits, and the soul.</p><p>When planning adventures along this theme, think about ways the characters can probe the realities before their eyes on a deeper level. For instance, as they investigate mysteries, you may want to occasionally provide ways for them to explore the Transitive Planes, and even the Outer Planes, to discover clues.</p><p>A mindscape (see page 234) is typically a surreal puzzle environment where the characters accomplish their tasks by navigating the mindscape and deceiving or satisfying the controlling mind, overcoming its defenses, unlocking its doors, and learning the secrets buried deep within.</p><p>GMs should be prepared to adjudicate scenes where the characters project themselves into nonphysical realms. Adventures along this theme might find the characters entering the twisted mindscape of an insane or possessed victim, or they might enter the mindscape of an enemy to steal hidden knowledge or implant subconscious suggestions.</p><h1>Fear and Reverence of the Unknown</h1><p>The Mysteries within Mysteries and Unseen Realms elements emphasize the feeling of otherworldly awe that the occult inspires by showing how the everyday world reacts to eerie phenomena. In occult adventures, ordinary people tend to fear unknown circumstances over which they have little control. Rumor and superstition only exacerbate their distress, and a frightened populace can swiftly resort to extreme measures, including holy inquisitions and witch hunts, in order to regain some assurance of security, no matter how short-lived it be. As a result of societal paranoia, the occult might be a forbidden art for the characters, and one that they must keep secret. Adventures might involve finding and communicating with other occult initiates by signals, tokens, or a specialized cant, while the adventurers bravely fight a shadow war on behalf of a world that shuns them.</p><p>As another take on this theme, the common crowd could develop a worshipful fascination toward people or entities skilled in the occult arts, consulting them for knowledge of the future or employing their psychic talents to quickly learn what ordinary folk cannot normally see or know. On the other hand, twisted individuals who wield occult power often attract lackeys and slaves willing to serve the dark arts, and the ranks of wicked cults teem with dangerous, unscrupulous predators enraptured by their charismatic cult leaders.</p><h1>Ultimate Occult</h1><p>GMs who wish to fully immerse PCs in an exclusively occult campaign will likely incorporate most or all of the occult elements, and brew multiple, overlapping themes to propel their campaigns toward darker realms. Without changing any game mechanics, arcane and divine classes can share in a game in which the characters are exceptional beings who dare to use powers beyond mortal ken.</p><p>NPCs with supernatural powers should be rare, or should conceal themselves from the world at large. Large and powerful churches may exist, exerting significant economic and political power, but only a few individuals ever perform miracles, and even these persons of extraordinary faith may fall out of favor with church doctrine. Perhaps in such campaigns there are no true gods, or their status as divine entities cannot be proven. It may be that the so-called gods are actually various spirits and other inscrutable forces that occupy the space between dimensions. The Outer Planes and the gods who dwell there may be just a shared manifestation of the collective consciousness, which appears to exist only because people believe that it does.</p><h1>OCCULT ADVENTURE SEEDS</h1><p>The following adventure seeds play on the elements and themes integral to occult adventures.</p><h1>A Brace of Imps</h1><p>Rumors of the corpses of strange creatures appearing for sale in the city are confirmed with the display of a brace of dead imps in a local market. Where are they from, and why are they here?</p><p><b>Discovery</b>: The characters overhear the rush of fear and excitement when the corpses of two imps appear for sale in a local bazaar. It is soon revealed that the source of the corpses is a local ragpicker with some knowledge of the occult, who discovered the imps discarded behind an old lodge building of a defunct fraternal society. Soon, another pair is discovered, and more pairs follow on its heels. What could be causing their appearance, and who is killing them two at a time?</p><p><b>Adversary</b>: The imps are actually the messengers of a powerful devil once in league with the defunct secret society. A sorcerer recently took up residence in the old lodge, and the imps began appearing with tempting offerings from their diabolical master. The sorcerer slew the daily emissaries and disposed of their bodies. Their master is angered by the spellcaster's violent response to his daily demands, and soon more powerful forces well out of the sorcerer's league may appear to exact revenge. Can the PCs come to the sorcerer's aid, or are they already too late?</p><p><b>Further Adventures</b>: The PCs may gain a new ally in the form of the sorcerer, or a powerful antagonist if she takes the devil's bargain. Does the ragpicker know more than he is willing to admit? What dark secrets does the lodge hold that the devil may seek for himself ?</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Feast of Souls</h1><p>With alarming frequency, the rising of the morning sun reveals multiple brutal murders from the night before, and the victims' souls, now separated from their mortal vessels, have failed to answer their bereaved relatives' calls during seances. Someone, or something, is harvesting the souls of the deceased before they can reach their ultimate reward.</p><p><b>Discovery</b>: The PCs encounter two competing seance circles that seek to uncover the murderer and the fate of the victims' souls. But both groups' ambitions are murky, and their combativeness threatens to rip the community apart. The PCs enter this chaotic scene as desperation sets in among the victims' families, who only want the comfort of knowing their relatives' souls have found final rest.</p><p><b>Adversary</b>: The seance circles began with good intentions, but one of them is unwittingly the pawn of a night hag, unknowingly concealing her dread ambitions. The night hag has extorted the local thieves' guild to gain its services by holding its leader hostage with her dream haunting ability. The guild is now murdering innocent victims so that she can bind their souls to her heartstone. She has also extorted a talented spiritualist in service to one seance circle to use his phantom in place of the rival circle's summoned spirits, sabotaging the group closest to discovering the terrible secret behind the murders by spreading disinformation and deceit. The PCs must reveal the truth behind these proceedings by exposing the fraudulent spiritualist or infiltrating the thieves' guild to discover the identity of the true mastermind behind the murders, before they can finally shatter the hag's heartstone and bring rest to the souls of the dead.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Further Adventures</b>: Destroying the hag's heartstone frees the bound souls within, but did the hag have a deeper, more insidious motivation than the mere collection of souls for profit in the evil planes? Perhaps she had captured the spirit of a powerful, corrupt entity that now threatens the city with darker strife after gaining its freedom. The PCs have brought peace to the community for a time, but at what price, and what deadly machinations await?</p><h1>Golem's Revenge</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Years ago, a vicious purge sought to wipe the poor and wretched from their homes in the city's slums, until a mysterious creature came to their salvation. Now, a generation later, the bodies of city authorities are left broken on the slum's streets for all to see.</p><p><b>Discovery</b>: The PCs are called on to investigate the murders and find the corpses brutally smashed and savagely disfigured in ways hardly possible for mortal man. Locals suspect a dimwitted strongman from a traveling freak show, but the true culprit is a deadly clay golem once built for protection.</p><p><b>Adversary</b>: The secret society responsible for the original purge is planning another. They decided it would be truly poetic if the same protector that stopped the previous purge became the spark for the new one. Using the <i>awaken construct</i>* spell, the son of the purge's original architect awakened the old protector, whose creator had since died of old age, and convinced it that he was its father.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>After sending it out to commit murders of authorities and build anger against the slums, the young aristocrat plans to betray the golem and come out of that betrayal as the hero who stopped the murders, as he leads a second retributive purge of the slums.</p><p><b>Further Adventures</b>: The PCs may defeat the golem, but unless they uncover the true plans of the secret society, they haven't thwarted the new purge. Will the PCs come to the rescue of those who cannot protect themselves? Convincing the golem of the truth might net the PCs a powerful ally, but if they destroyed it, they might need to find the old golem crafter's notes and try to teach themselves the occult rituals he used so they can fashion a new golem, if they are to have any hope of defeating the cult's foul undertaking.</p><h1>Lost Souls</h1><p>When a wise and benevolent ruler mysteriously falls unconscious and begins to waste away, turmoil erupts throughout the land as various factions vie for power.</p><p><b>Discovery</b>: The ruler's regent, a skilled spiritualist, desperately seeks the PCs. The PCs must take a dangerous psychic journey to the Ethereal Plane, the Dimension of Dreams, or both, in order to find the monarch's errant mind or soul and bring it back before the body dies and the land is divided by strife. If the PCs perish while on this journey, their bodies suffer the same fate as the ruler.</p><p><b>Adversary</b>: The ruler has no desire to return to the sorrows of life on the Material Plane, and opposes the PCs at every turn. On the Ethereal Plane, the ruler's spirit makes a procession toward Heaven accompanied by the spirits of loyal knights. The procession visits the ethereal versions of three places significant to the ruler in life. If the characters travel to the Dimension of Dreams, these places are idealized memories rather than ethereal haunts.</p><p>Regardless of the reality the PCs visit, the ruler resists them. The characters must learn the true reasons for the ruler's sorrow and convince the mind or soul to return to the body. Along the way, they may clash with the ruler's champions as they seek to accomplish their goals.</p><p><b>Further Adventures</b>: If the ruler's coma was result of the dark arts or an attempted assassination, the true culprits may lurk in ambush for the characters as they voyage through these strange realms. And as the characters explore, they find the processions of other rulers heading toward Heaven or Hell. Are these events all somehow connected?</p><h1>The Menhir</h1><p>Every generation, the people of a village on a windswept moor venture out to a solitary menhir, where they join hands and say old words in a language that's been passed down from generation to generation. Farther from this place, in a hidden hillside glen, is a smaller circle of stones-one for every generation- with human bones buried below, the remains of offerings.</p><p><b>Discovery</b>: The PCs stop at the village during the course of their adventures. During their stay, the villagers welcome them and throw a feast, declaring one PC to be the \"monarch\" of the harvest and a villager the PC's symbolic \"consort.\" During the night, the villagers make a clumsy attempt to abduct the honored PC and bring him to the menhir (if they fail to abduct the PC, they snatch a second villager instead). The villagers abandon their homes and gather around the menhir, chanting words in a forgotten language. The chosen monarchs are within the circle, seemingly unharmed. If the PCs don't interfere, the next day the king and queen are simply gone, and the villagers claim ignorance of their whereabouts and seem reluctant to investigate.</p><p><b>Adversary</b>: A psychic ghost or aberrant horror bound to the menhir manifests every generation to feed on the offerings provided by the villagers. When the being feeds, the menhir glows with a soft golden radiance, and the land for miles around becomes rich and fertile for a whole generation. If the PCs stake out the menhir during the night of the sacrifice, they have a chance to fight the creature, and if they rescue the sacrifices, the creature comes after them.</p><p><b>Further Adventures</b>: Creatures of psychic power are attracted to a ley line passing through the menhir. Following the ley line leads to other villages with their own menhirs; those that were denied their sacrifices are now surrounded by dry and desolate land where nothing lives. Ley lines lead from these menhirs as well, on and on throughout the world. Generation after generation, the beings bound to these menhirs feed and grow more powerful. How can the PCs release the common folk from these mysterious horrors?</p><h1>Mind Trap</h1><p>The PCs find a remarkable amount of success during their exploits, but all is not as it seems.</p><p><b>Discovery</b>: After concluding a previous adventure, the PCs celebrate a job well done. During their revelry, they meet a woman who is excited for their success and invites them to her villa. She offers comfortable beds, fine foods and drinks, and the run of her abode. She tells them they are welcome to stay as long as they like, if they help her with a simple task.</p><p><b>Adversary</b>: The woman is actually the consciousness of an ancient being imprisoned within an immersive mindscape. It long ago stopped trying to escape its mental prison, and now all it wants is some companionship. The PCs were unknowingly drawn into the consciousness's mindscape at some point during their previous adventure, and are now trapped there with it. The consciousness creates whatever the characters desire, weaving a compelling tapestry of experience at first indistinguishable from the material world. Eventually, the characters figure out that wealth, fame, and fortune are falling into their laps just a little too easily and realize they must find a way out of the mindscape.</p><p><b>Further Adventures</b>: The PCs might decide to destroy the mindscape-perhaps by traveling to the Dimension of Dreams, and possibly even freeing the ancient consciousness in the process. Other trapped creatures might exist inside the mindscape, and freeing them might provide the characters with future contacts or adversaries.</p><h1>The Order</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Following a series of disasters or a virulent plague, the desperate populace places its faith in a fanatical faction of an otherwise reputable church. With great resources now at their disposal, the zealots promise to undo the curse by appeasing the gods through punishment of evildoers and heretics.</p><p><b>Discovery</b>: \"Witch hunters\" begin an inquisition and arrest anyone who dabbles in magic or the supernatural, including clerics of other faiths. The PCs enter the scene when the witch hunters attempt to arrest them or their allies, or when family members and close associates are captured by the order.</p><p><b>Adversary</b>: Outwardly, the leader of the order, the Truthseeker, appears to be its most rational and penitent member. In truth, this person is a psychic tyrant who uses his abilities to read minds and expose enemies of the order.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>In short time, the splinter faction becomes a powerful cult as the Truthseeker trains the witch hunters to read minds and tell the future. The PCs might simply rescue their allies from the order, or they might expose the Truthseeker.</p><p><b>Further Adventures</b>: As the Truthseeker's cult gathers power, how does the original church respond? How many cities and towns has it infiltrated, and how readily does it swell its numbers? Did the cultists cause the tragic events that led to their rise to power? Even if the PCs stop the Truthseeker, is another cult member ready to take up the mantle?</p><h1>Portrait of Evil</h1><p>The PCs are tasked with looking into a series of disappearances in a major city. During their investigation, they accidentally come across evidence that implicates a local noble. While the evidence is conclusive in their eyes, it's inadmissible to the local courts, and they soon find themselves at odds with the accused. The PCs are unaware that their suspect is the owner of a <i>soul portrait </i>(see page 268).</p><p><b>Discovery</b>: As the PCs delve into the background of the accused, they learn that despite her youthful appearance, she is well into her seventies. Further research reveals that a series of her acquaintances, competitors, and family members disappeared in the years following her thirtieth birthday. Detailed investigation discovers the accused's obsession with a portrait commissioned in her late twenties, a portrait that some visitors describe as a vision of a rare and radiant beauty, and others speak of only in haunted whispers.</p><p><b>Adversary</b>: The accused noble is defended by a legion of mercenaries who are too powerful for the PCs to assault directly. The <i>soul portrait </i>prevents divinations that would reveal her true nature, projecting the image of her innocent younger self. While the PCs are sure she is the cause of the disappearances and other crimes, the noble deflects any blame by means of her sizable wealth and perceived charitable nature.</p><p>When the PCs truly become a threat to her, the noble attacks those closest to them using various forms of harassment and torture. The PCs have to contend with a foe empowered by the (mistaken) belief that she can suffer no consequences from her actions. Eventually, unless the PCs find a way to catch the accused in a situation where her portrait can't protect her, they are forced to take the law into their own hands.</p><p><b>Further Adventures</b>: When the accused is defeated, her image moves to the background of the <i>soul portrait</i>, and the PCs are left with the unsavory task of deciding what to do with the artifact. Less scrupulous PCs may decide to take it for themselves, commissioning an artist to add their likenesses to the canvas, having learned of the powers bequeathed by the portrait. PCs with stronger morals might seek to destroy the artifact, but will soon learn that only the owner of a <i>soul portrait </i>can destroy it- and at the high cost of another's life.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter6runninganoccultgame\">^Running an Occult Game</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter7occultrewards\">Occult Rewards</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"Yv66W6AAyTQz398W"}

Until the next time your burn is removed, you gain evasion, as the rogue class feature.</p><h1>Aether Puppet</h1><p><b>Element </b>aether; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>5; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You use strands of aether to animate an object. You can animate a Medium or smaller object as an animated object (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>14) with no Construction Point abilities (except for stone or metal [common], if the object is constructed of one of those materials). Each round on your turn, you must take a move action to guide the object, or it reverts to its inanimate state. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can pour a bit of your own sentience into the aether puppet, allowing the effect to persist for 1 round per kineticist level without requiring additional actions. At 12th level, you can animate a Large or smaller object, which gains all the abilities of the Medium animated object plus the additional attack ability. At 14th level, you can animate a Huge or smaller object, which gains all the abilities of the Large animated object.

You are constantly under the effects of <i>feather fall</i>, and you count as one size category larger for the purpose of determining how you are affected by wind.</p><h1>Air Shroud</h1><p><b>Element </b>air; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>1; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You are always surrounded by air, as <i>air bubble(</i>UC).

When you accept burn to grant the benefit to others, the benefit lasts until the next time your burn is removed.</p><h1>Airs Leap</h1><p><b>Element </b>air; <b>Type </b>utility (Su); <b>Level </b>1; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You are always considered to have a running start when jumping, you add your kineticist level as a bonus on all Acrobatics checks to jump, you jump twice as far or high as the results of your check indicate, and you can accept 1 point of burn when jumping to double the distance you jump again (to a total of four times as far).</p><h1>Airs Reach</h1><p><b>Element </b>air; <b>Type </b>utility (Su); <b>Level </b>1; <b>Burn </b>-</p><p>When using air blasts, air wild talents, or composite blasts that include air, double the blast's effective range. This effect applies after altering the range due to effects such as the extended range infusion. This doubles only the blast's effective range, not the area of effect for infusions like cloud and cyclone.</p><h1>Basic Aerokinesis</h1><p><b>Element </b>air; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>1; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You can create a light breeze that blows against a creature or object from a direction of your choice that follows the target wherever it goes. The breeze grants the subject a +2 bonus on saves against very hot conditions, severe heat, breath weapons, and cloud vapors and gases (such as <i>cloudkill</i>, <i>stinking cloud</i>, and inhaled poisons). This wild talent doesn't function without air or while underwater. You can have only one such breeze active at any one time.</p><p>You can also use your aerokinesis to make it harder to detect you or others by scent. You can designate a number of creatures or objects equal to your Constitution bonus. These creatures and objects always count as being downwind for the purpose of determining the distance at which they can be detected by scent. This effect lasts for 1 hour or until you use basic aerokinesis again, whichever comes first.</p><h1>Basic Geokinesis</h1><p><b>Element </b>earth; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>1; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You can move up to 5 pounds per kineticist level of rocks, loose earth, sand, clay, and other similar materials up to 15 feet as a move action.

While you cannot lift water into the air using this ability, you can create mild currents in a body of water by concentrating. These currents are strong enough to run a water mill as if the mill were being turned manually by a creature with a Strength score equal to your Constitution score.</p><h1>Basic Pyrokinesis</h1><p><b>Element </b>fire; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>1; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You can use your inner flame to reproduce the effects of a <i>flare</i>, <i>light</i>, or <i>spark</i>(APG) cantrip, except that the light you create with <i>light </i>produces heat like a normal flame; using any of the three abilities ends any previous <i>light </i>effect from this wild talent.</p><h1>Basic Telekinesis</h1><p><b>Element </b>aether; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>1; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>This ability is similar to <i>mage hand</i>, except you can move an object that weighs up to 5 pounds per 2 kineticist levels you possess (minimum 5 pounds), and you can move magical objects. Additionally, you can create a container of entwined strands of aether in order to hold liquids or piles of small objects of the same weight. You can dip the container to pick up or drop a liquid as a move action. If you possess the extended range wild talent, you can increase the range of basic telekinesis to medium range and increase the rate of movement to 30 feet per round, and if you possess the extreme range wild talent, you can increase the range of basic telekinesis to long range and increase the rate of movement to 60 feet per round. You can also use your basic telekinesis to duplicate the effects of the <i>open/ close </i>cantrip.</p><h1>Celerity</h1><p><b>Element </b>air; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You can galvanize the flow of electricity within your allies to enhance their speed. This acts as <i>haste </i>except it lasts for 1 round. You can accept 1 point of burn to increase the duration to 1 round per kineticist level you possess.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Cold Adaptation</h1><p><b>Element </b>fire or water; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>1; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You are constantly protected by <i>endure elements </i>against cold temperatures only. You gain cold resistance equal to twice your current amount of burn.</p><h1>Cold Snap</h1><p><b>Element </b>water; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>1</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b> cold adaptation, shroud of water</p><p>You chill your shroud of water and send the cold around you, creating an aura of numbing cold around yourself.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Until the next time your burn is removed, you can begin or end the cold aura at will as a swift action. The temperature in the area 30 feet around you lowers by 5 F per kineticist level you possess, to a minimum modified temperature of -10 F. If this brings the temperature in the area below 40 F, all creatures within 5 feet of you take a -4 penalty to Dexterity. You are immune to these effects, as are creatures that are immune to cold or that benefit from effects that protect against temperature, such as <i>endure elements</i>.</p><h1>Earth Climb</h1><p><b>Element </b>earth; <b>Type </b>utility (Su); <b>Level </b>2; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You use your connection to earth to meld slightly into stone and earthen surfaces, granting you a climb speed equal to your base land speed when climbing such surfaces.</p><h1>Earth Glide</h1><p><b>Element </b>earth; <b>Type </b>utility (Su); <b>Level </b>5; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>earth climb</p><p>You can glide through earth, as an earth elemental's earth glide ability, with a burrow speed equal to your base land speed.</p><h1>Earth Walk</h1><p><b>Element </b>earth; <b>Type </b>utility (Su); <b>Level </b>1; <b>Burn 0</b></p><p>Because you meld very slightly into the earth, when you are standing on an earthen surface, you ignore difficult terrain caused by rocks, earth, or mud, and while on such surfaces you add your elemental overflow bonus to your CMD against being moved or tripped and on Acrobatics checks to balance.</p><h1>Elemental Grip</h1><p><b>Element </b>universal; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p><p>You use your element to halt a creature associated with your element, as <i>hold monster </i>except it requires concentration to maintain, and it works only on creatures with a subtype matching one of your elements (for example, a pyrokineticist could use it on creatures of the fire subtype). At any time, you can accept 1 point of burn to remove the need to concentrate.</p><h1>Enduring Earth</h1><p><b>Element </b>earth; <b>Type </b>utility (Su); <b>Level </b>4; <b>Burn </b>-</p><p>When using earth blasts, earth wild talents, or composite blasts that include earth, double the duration if it's longer than 1 round.</p><h1>Engulfing Winds</h1><p><b>Element </b>air; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>enveloping winds</p><p>You bend your winds into a formidable barrier. Until the start of your next turn, you lose the benefits of enveloping winds, but can create a <i>wind wall </i>as the spell. You can extend the wall's duration to 1 round per kineticist level by accepting 1 point of burn.</p><h1>Expanded Defense</h1><p><b>Element </b>universal; <b>Type </b>utility (Su); <b>Level </b>4; <b>Burn </b>-</p><p>Choose an element you selected with expanded element. You gain that element's defense wild talent. You can take this wild talent multiple times, choosing a different element each time.</p><h1>Fire Sculptor</h1><p><b>Element </b>fire; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>1; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You can sculpt shapes out of flame or alter a fire's spread. As a standard action, you can move one 5-foot square of an ongoing fire per kineticist level you possess to any square contiguous to that fire. For instance, a 4th-level kineticist could move 4 contiguous squares from the center of a 20-foot-by-20-foot fire to the fire's edge in order to create a safe path to escape. The fire continues to spread normally after you sculpt it.</p><h1>Fires Fury</h1><p><b>Element </b>fire; <b>Type </b>utility (Su); <b>Level </b>1; <b>Burn </b>-</p><p>When using fire blasts or composite blasts that include fire, add your elemental overflow bonus to the damage dealt. If the kinetic blast normally adds double your elemental overflow bonus to damage, these effects stack.</p><h1>Firesight</h1><p><b>Element </b>fire; <b>Type </b>utility (Su); <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>-</p><p>You can see through flames and smoke as if they were transparent. Creatures that are on fire or have the fire subtype never benefit from concealment or total concealment against you.</p><h1>Flame Jet</h1><p><b>Element </b>fire; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You shoot a burst of flame behind you as a standard action, propelling you up to 60 feet in a straight line, including into the air; any movement upward costs double. If you end your turn mid-air, you fall on your next turn unless you use flame jet again.</p><h1>Flame Jet, Greater</h1><p><b>Element </b>fire; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>5; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>flame jet</p><p>You can use flame jet as a move action and can emanate a mild jet of flame, allowing you to hover without spending an action.</p><h1>Flame Shield</h1><p><b>Element </b>fire; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>5; <b>Burn </b>1</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>searing flesh</p><p>Flickering flames surround you until the next time your burn is removed. While your searing flesh infusion is active, any creature that strikes you with a melee attack takes an amount of fire damage equal to 1/2 your kineticist level unless it is using a reach weapon. If the creature also takes damage from your searing flesh, it applies fire resistance only once against the total damage from both effects. You also gain the protection from cold of a warm <i>fire shield</i>. An attack that would deal an amount of cold damage equal to at least double your kineticist level (before you applied the protection) freezes away your flame shield after you apply its protection, ending the flame shield early.</p><h1>Force Barrier</h1><p><b>Element </b>aether; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>5; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>force ward</p><p>You create an immobile sphere or hemisphere of force around your square or squares. The force barrier functions as a <i>wall of force </i>in all other ways. Activating this ability is a standard action, and the barrier lasts until the beginning of your next turn. Each round, just before the barrier would disappear, you can extend its duration by accepting 1 point of burn. If an attack manages to destroy the force barrier, you immediately take 1 point of burn.</p><h1>From The Ashes</h1><p><b>Element </b>fire; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>9; <b>Burn </b>2</p><p>When you are about to fall unconscious or die from hit point damage, as an immediate action you can burst into flames that leave behind only ash, which cannot be appreciably affected by most attacks or effects, though a <i>disintegrate </i>spell or similar magic can annihilate it. At the start of your next turn, unless the ash has been completely destroyed, you arise in the square where the most ash is located, having taken the damage from the triggering effect but having also healed 5 points of damage per kineticist level you possess.</p><h1>Heat Adaptation</h1><p><b>Element </b>fire or water; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>1; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You are constantly protected by <i>endure elements </i>against hot temperatures only. You gain an amount of fire resistance equal to twice your current amount of burn.</p><h1>Heat Wave</h1><p><b>Element </b>fire; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>1</p><p><b>Prerequisites </b>heat adaptation, searing flesh</p><p>You create an aura of shimmering heat that distorts the area around you. Until the next time your burn is removed, you can begin or end the heat aura as a swift action. The temperature in the area 30 feet around you rises by 5 F per kineticist level you possess, to a maximum modified temperature of 120 F. If this brings the temperature to at least 90 F, all attacks made by creatures within 5 feet of you suffer a 20% miss chance due to concealment. You are immune to these effects, as are those immune to fire or benefiting from <i>endure elements</i>.</p><h1>Ice Path</h1><p><b>Element </b>water; <b>Type </b>utility (Su); <b>Level </b>6; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>icewalker</p><p>You freeze water vapor in the air, allowing you to travel above the ground as <i>air walk </i>by walking along the ice, and leaving a path of ice behind you that lasts for 1 round before it melts.</p><h1>Ice Sculptor</h1><p><b>Element </b>water; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>4; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You can sculpt ice and snow into new shapes, as the spell <i>stone shape </i>but affecting ice and snow instead of stone.</p><h1>Icewalker</h1><p><b>Element </b>water; <b>Type </b>utility (Su); <b>Level </b>1; <b>Burn </b>-</p><p>You can move across wet and icy surfaces without needing to attempt Acrobatics checks due to slipperiness, including across areas under the effects of the slick wild talent. Additionally, you are immune to seasickness.</p><h1>Jagged Flesh</h1><p><b>Element </b>earth; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>1</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>flesh of stone</p><p>You painfully push forth jagged chunks of rock from your flesh. Until the next time your burn is removed, while your flesh of stone is active, any creature that strikes you with an unarmed strike or natural weapon or that grapples you takes 1d6 points of piercing damage. Weapons that strike you also take this damage, though the damage is unlikely to penetrate the weapon's hardness.</p><h1>Kinetic Cover</h1><p><b>Element </b>aether, earth, or water; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>1; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You call up elemental matter to defend yourself and your allies from attacks. As a standard action, you can select one face of a square within 30 feet of you and move elemental matter to block that face, providing total cover from that direction. The face you select must be supported by the ground, and the kinetic cover cannot support more than 5 pounds of weight. Water, ice, and telekinetic force are translucent, but earth, metal, mud, and the like are opaque and block line of sight. A creature who strikes the cover can easily destroy it. Regardless of its composition, the cover has hardness 0, AC 5, and 2 hit points per kineticist level you possess. You can have a number of kinetic covers in existence equal to your Constitution modifier + 1/2 your kineticist level.</p><h1>Kinetic Form</h1><p><b>Element </b>universal; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>5; <b>Burn </b>1</p><p>You are able to suspend your body in a large mass of elemental matter. Until the next time your burn is removed, you can change your size to Large or shift back to your original size as a standard action. This doesn't change your ability scores in any way. At 16th level, you can accept 1 additional point of burn to instead change your size to Huge. You cannot use kinetic form to decrease your size.</p><h1>Kinetic Healer</h1><p><b>Element </b>aether or water; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>1; <b>Burn </b>1; see text</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p><p>With a touch, you can heal a willing living creature of an amount of damage equal to your kinetic blast's damage. Instead of paying the burn cost yourself, you can cause the recipient to take 1 point of burn. If you do so, the recipient takes 1 point of nonlethal damage per Hit Die he possesses, as usual for burn; this damage can't be healed by any means until the recipient takes a full night's rest.</p><h1>Reverse Shift</h1><p><b>Element </b>universal; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>8; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You reverse the flow of your connection to the planes, sending your body into the Ethereal Plane as <i>ethereal jaunt</i>. As long as you concentrate on reverse shift, you remain on the Ethereal Plane; after a number of consecutive rounds spent on the Ethereal Plane equal to your kineticist level (and every such interval thereafter), you must accept 1 point of burn. Once you return to the Material Plane, you cannot use reverse shift again for a number of rounds equal to the number of rounds you spent on the Ethereal Plane.</p><h1>Ride The Blast</h1><p><b>Element </b>universal; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>6; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You can use this wild talent as part of activating a kinetic blast other than telekinetic blast. You transform yourself into your element or energy and send yourself along with your kinetic blast. You appear at the end of the blast's path, adjacent to the blast's target (or final target, for form infusions like chain) or at the center of the burst or spread for form infusions like explosion. This ability doesn't work with form infusions that involve melee attacks (such as kinetic blade) or that use a cone shape (such as spray).</p><h1>Searing Flame</h1><p><b>Element </b>fire; <b>Type </b>utility (Su); <b>Level </b>2; <b>Burn </b>-</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>burning infusion</p><p>Over time, your burning infusion sears away your foe's fire resistance. When you roll burn damage from burning infusion against a foe, decrease the foe's fire resistance by an amount equal to the unmodified burn damage; don't apply fire resistance to this roll for the purpose of determining the reduction. This decrease lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your kineticist level. These decreases stack, to a minimum resistance of 0.</p><h1>Seismic Master</h1><p><b>Element </b>earth; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>9; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You can focus on your connection to earth and create a localized tremor, as the <i>earthquake </i>spell.</p><h1>Self Telekinesis</h1><p><b>Element </b>aether; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You use your telekinetic abilities to move yourself.

Otherwise, this wild talent functions like greater flame jet.</p><h1>Shift Earth</h1><p><b>Element </b>earth; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>4; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>kinetic cover</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>see text; <b>Spell Resistance </b>no</p><p>As a standard action, you can push or pull a 5-foot cube of earth or unworked stone within 30 feet, moving the cube 5 feet in any direction. You can create raised platforms, stairs up a cliff, holes, or other useful features. This doesn't cause the earth to float in the air, although in areas with plenty of earth, you can move a cube upward, creating a short pillar. If you move the earth beneath a creature's feet, it can attempt a DC 20 Reflex save to leap elsewhere and avoid moving along with the earth.</p><h1>Shift Earth, Greater</h1><p><b>Element </b>earth; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>7; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Prerequisites </b>kinetic cover, shift earth</p><p>You can move greater quantities of earth, as the spell <i>move earth</i>.</p><h1>Shimmering Mirage</h1><p><b>Element </b>water; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>5; <b>Burn </b>1</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>shroud of water</p><p>Your shroud bends light, creating a shimmering mirage.

Add Knowledge (planes) to your list of class skills. Choose one of your kineticist class skills that wasn't granted by your primary element to also receive the bonus from skilled kineticist.</p><h1>Slick</h1><p><b>Element </b>water; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>1; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Reflex negates; <b>Spell Resistance </b>no</p><p>As a standard action, you call forth slippery water or ice, creating any of the effects of the <i>grease </i>spell for 1 round. You can accept 1 point of burn at the start of your next turn to extend the duration to 1 minute per kineticist level you possess.</p><h1>Smoke Storm</h1><p><b>Element </b>fire; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Fortitude negates; see text; <b>Spell Resistance </b>no</p><p>You transform a source of open flame within 120 feet into a cloud of choking smoke, filling a 20-foot-radius spread and affecting vision like a smokestick. All creatures that begin their turns inside the area become sickened as long as they remain in the smoke and for 1d4+1 rounds thereafter (Fortitude negates).</p><h1>Spark Of Life</h1><p><b>Element </b>universal; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>5; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You breathe a semblance of life into elemental matter, which takes the form of a Medium elemental of any of your elements as if summoned by <i>summon monster IV </i>with a caster level equal to your kineticist level, except the elemental gains the mindless trait. Each round on your turn, you must take a move action to guide the elemental or it collapses back into its component element. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can pour a bit of your own sentience into the elemental, removing the mindless quality and allowing it to persist for 1 round per kineticist level without requiring any further actions. At 12th level, you can choose to form a Large elemental as if by <i>summon monster V</i>; at 14th level, you can choose to form a Huge elemental as if by <i>summon monster VI</i>; at 16th level, you can choose to form a greater elemental as if by <i>summon monster VII</i>; and at 18th level, you can choose to form an elder elemental as if by <i>summon monster VIII</i>.</p><h1>Spell Deflection</h1><p><b>Element </b>aether; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>7; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You weave strands of aether around yourself in order to deflect targeted magic back at the caster. Until the beginning of your next turn, every time you are targeted by a spell that could be affected by <i>spell turning</i>, roll 1d10-1 and determine the effects of the spell as if you had <i>spell turning </i>with that many spell levels remaining. You can accept 1 point of burn to increase the duration to 10 minutes per kineticist level you possess, but in that case, it deflects only 10 spell levels in total (still rolled 1d10-1 at a time) before ending early.</p><h1>Stone Sculptor</h1><p><b>Element </b>earth; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>5; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You can sculpt earth into any shape, as the spell <i>stone shape</i>.</p><h1>Suffocate</h1><p><b>Elements </b>aether, air, or water; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>6; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Fortitude partial; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p><p>You use aether to choke a creature within 120 feet, air to create an area of unbreathable air around it, or water to fill its throat with water. If your target needs to breathe, it must hold its breath for as long as you concentrate. On each of its turns, it can attempt a Fortitude save in order to speak, but it can breathe only if your concentration breaks, you leave the 120-foot range, or you break line of effect. You can accept 1 point of burn when activating this wild talent in order to expel the air from your target's lungs. If you do so and the target fails its first Fortitude save, it becomes disabled and is reduced to 0 hit points, and on its second failed Fortitude save, it falls unconscious and is reduced to -1 hit points.</p><h1>Telekinetic Deflection</h1><p><b>Element </b>aether; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>8; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You can deflect your foes' attacks, as the spell <i>deflection</i>(APG) with a duration of 1 round. You can accept 1 point of burn to increase the duration to 1 round per kineticist level you possess.</p><h1>Telekinetic Finesse</h1><p><b>Element </b>aether; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>1; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You can perform any sort of fine manipulation you choose within close range, including attempting Sleight of Hand and Disable Device checks.</p><h1>Telekinetic Globe</h1><p><b>Element </b>aether; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>8; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Prerequisites </b>force barrier, force ward</p><p>You can create a globe of force, as the <i>telekinetic sphere </i>spell, that lasts as long as you concentrate as a standard action, and you can move the globe as a move action. You can accept 1 point of burn to increase the duration to 1 minute per level and eliminate the need to concentrate to maintain the globe.</p><h1>Telekinetic Haul</h1><p><b>Element </b>aether; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>2; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>basic telekinesis</p><p>When using basic telekinesis, you can move an object that weighs up to 100 pounds per kineticist level you possess. When using your telekinetic blast, you can throw an object weighing up to 100 pounds per kineticist level you possess, but this doesn't increase the damage. If you accept 1 point of burn, the maximum weight increases to 1,000 pounds per kineticist level you possess and the duration increases to 1 minute per kineticist level you possess.</p><h1>Telekinetic Invisibility</h1><p><b>Element </b>aether; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You weave strands of aether, bending light and dampening sound; this works as <i>invisibility </i>except that the aetheric bending is easier to notice than normal invisibility, so your bonus on Stealth checks is halved (+10 while moving and +20 while perfectly still). However, the dampened sound allows you to avoid automatic detection via sound-based blindsense and blindsight, but you do not receive the bonus on Stealth checks from this wild talent against a creature with such abilities.</p><h1>Telekinetic Maneuvers</h1><p><b>Element </b>aether; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>4; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p><p>You can perform combat maneuvers as <i>telekinesis</i>, but you use your Constitution modifier to determine your Combat Maneuver Bonus rather than your Intelligence or Charisma modifier. If you possess the telekinetic finesse wild talent, add dirty trick and steal combat maneuvers to the list of combat maneuvers you can perform; when performing these maneuvers, determine your Combat Maneuver Bonus using your Dexterity modifier instead of your Constitution modifier.</p><h1>Tidal Wave</h1><p><b>Element </b>water; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>9; <b>Burn </b>1</p><p>You call forth a powerful tidal wave, as <i>tsunami</i>(APG).</p><h1>Touchsight</h1><p><b>Element </b>aether; <b>Type </b>utility (Su); <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You attach strands of aether to everything your telekinesis touches. Any time you damage a creature using your telekinetic blast, as long as that creature doesn't use a teleportation effect, you can see that creature at any distance as if using blindsight until the end of your next turn. Immediately after damaging a creature, you can accept 1 point of burn to strengthen the strands of aether attached to that creature, increasing the duration of the touchsight on that creature to 1 round per kineticist level.</p><h1>Touchsight, Reactive</h1><p><b>Element </b>aether; <b>Type </b>utility (Su); <b>Level </b>5; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>touchsight</p><p>Your strands of aether surround you, making it virtually impossible for a violent motion to catch you off guard, so long as the motion originates within their range. You are never denied your Dexterity bonus to AC against attacks from within 30 feet because of being flat-footed or because your assailant is unseen or invisible. You always succeed at any Perception check to act on the surprise round against opponents within 30 feet.</p><h1>Trail Of Flames</h1><p><b>Element </b>fire; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>5; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p><p>When you take the withdraw or run action, you can leave a <i>wall of fire </i>in all squares you exit that lasts for 1 round.</p><h1>Tremorsense</h1><p><b>Element </b>earth; <b>Type </b>utility (Su); <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You can take a move action to gain tremorsense 30 feet for 1 round on any earth or stone surface that you touch. You can accept 1 point of burn to increase the duration to 1 round per kineticist level you possess. While benefiting from this tremorsense, your earth blasts and composite blasts that include earth components don't suffer a miss chance from concealment or total concealment against creatures you detect with your tremorsense.</p><h1>Tremorsense, Greater</h1><p><b>Element </b>earth; <b>Type </b>utility (Su); <b>Level </b>5; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>tremorsense</p><p>You can spend 10 minutes to extend your tremorsense outward while in a natural underground setting, letting you learn three facts as if using <i>commune with nature</i>, except your tremorsense can't tell if a creature is a woodland creature or a powerful unnatural creature.</p><h1>Veil Of Mists</h1><p><b>Element </b>water; <b>Type </b>utility (Su); <b>Level </b>2; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You create a misty veil over your features, disguising yourself as <i>disguise self </i>for a number of minutes equal to your Constitution modifier. If you accept 1 point of burn, until the next time your burn is removed, each use of this wild talent lasts until you dismiss it.</p><h1>Voice Of The Wind</h1><p><b>Element </b>air; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>1; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p><p>When you whisper, you can have the wind carry your voice to the ears of anyone you can see within 120 feet, as if they were one of the targets of a <i>message </i>spell you cast. Alternatively, you can send your voice to a distant location as if casting <i>whispering wind</i>.</p><h1>Water Manipulator</h1><p><b>Element </b>water; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>kinetic cover</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none; see text; <b>Spell Resistance </b>no</p><p>You can manipulate massive quantities of water. As a standard action, you can raise or lower the level of water as if using <i>control water</i>, or move an amount of water equal to 1/1,000th the amount controlled by that spell to a different location in range. The water remains where you placed it for as long as you remain motionless and take a standard action each round to concentrate on this effect. This wild talent causes a <i>slow </i>effect on creatures made of water, just like <i>control water </i>(Will negates). When you cease concentrating, the water flows normally unless you accept 1 point of burn to extend the duration and hold the water in its current position for 10 minutes per kineticist level you possess.</p><h1>Waterdancer</h1><p><b>Element </b>water; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>You call forth a current of water to increase your speed and allow you to swim with ease, as if under the effects of <i>slipstream</i>(APG) with unlimited duration.</p><h1>Waterdancer, Greater</h1><p><b>Element </b>water; <b>Type </b>utility (Su); <b>Level </b>5; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>waterdancer</p><p>You can move across water (as <i>water walk</i>) at will and breathe underwater, and your slashing and bludgeoning attacks don't take the usual penalties when you're underwater.</p><h1>Watersense</h1><p><b>Element </b>water; <b>Type </b>utility (Su); <b>Level </b>4; <b>Burn </b>-</p><p>You gain tremorsense with a range of 30 feet to detect anything in contact with the same body of water as you. While you are benefiting from this tremorsense, your water blasts and composite blasts that include water don't suffer a miss chance from concealment or total concealment against creatures you detect with this tremorsense.</p><h1>Weather Master</h1><p><b>Element </b>air; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>8; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p>By focusing on your connection to air and seeding the air around you for 10 minutes, you can create powerful weather effects, as <i>control weather</i>. You can create tornadoes or hurricane-force winds, as appropriate for the season. If you have access to the fire element, you can create hot weather, a heat wave, a thaw, or an early spring. If you have access to the water element, you can create all other types of weather listed in <i>control weather</i>.</p><h1>Wind Manipulator</h1><p><b>Element </b>air; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>6; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>engulfing winds</p><p>You can call forth mighty winds in an enormous area. As a standard action, you can alter the wind around you as if using <i>control winds</i>, but the change remains only for as long as you continue to take a standard action to concentrate on this effect. If you accept 1 point of burn, you can extend the duration to 10 minutes per kineticist level you possess without your needing to concentrate.</p><h1>Windsight</h1><p><b>Element </b>air; <b>Type </b>utility (Su); <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>-</p><p>You can see through mist and fog (including <i>fog cloud </i>and similar magic). In areas of moderate or stronger wind, you can see and hear as if you were standing at both your own position and a position a number of feet in the wind's direction equal to the wind's speed in miles per hour, potentially allowing you to see around corners and other obstacles.</p><h1>Windsight, Greater</h1><p><b>Element </b>air; <b>Type </b>utility (Su); <b>Level </b>5; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>windsight</p><p>You can send a slight breeze in a path up to 480 feet long and then back to where you wait. This allows you to use your windsight wild talent to catch a quick glimpse and hear a tiny snippet from any location that could be reached by the wind traveling that distance (the wind's path can't pass through openings smaller than 1 inch in diameter). The breeze travels 100 feet per round, so what you see and hear is delayed by 1 round for every 50 feet of the path. If you spend at least 10 minutes to set up a steady flow of wind, you can concentrate for up to 1 minute per level to gain continuous visual and auditory information for as long as you concentrate, delayed by 1 round for every 100 feet the wind travels (since the steady flow of wind has to travel only one way). While there is no invisible sensor to detect with this ability, creatures along the path of the breeze may notice a light wind, though it may not seem out of the ordinary.</p><h1>Wings Of Air</h1><p><b>Element </b>air; <b>Type </b>utility (Sp); <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>0</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>air cushion or air's leap</p><p>The air bends to your will, allowing you to soar to great heights. You are constantly under the effects of <i>fly</i>. If this effect is dispelled, you can call it forth again as a standard action.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1occultclasses\">^Occult Classes</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypes\">Archetypes</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"ZK91hTzOSIMwiDwq"}

This record includes your current hit point total, physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution), and any conditional modifiers or conditions such as ability damage to physical ability scores, disease, negative levels, and poison. If at any point within the duration of the spell you are reduced to fewer than 0 hit points or are slain by a death effect that is not mind-affecting, you can immediately let your current physical body die and assume the record of your physical body on your next turn. When this happens, your corpse disappears, and you can either resume the place of your dead body (already wearing any clothing still attached to the corpse) or appear in any place you've been within 500 feet of where your corpse lies (but without any of your gear).</p><p>You still retain your original mind, and therefore don't regain any spells. You are still under any mental influences and energy drain effects you were under when you recalled the record of your physical body, but don't retain any physical effects such as bleed damage or poison (unless you suffered from these conditions at the time the spell was cast). Spells affecting you when you store a record of yourself abide by their normal durations. For example, if you were affected by <i>cat's grace </i>when you created the record and you restore your body 1 hour later, you won't be under that effect anymore since its duration has already expired. This spell doesn't allow you to avoid dying of old age. Casting this spell again replaces any previous version you cast; you can't store more than one copy of yourself in the Akashic Record.</p><h1>Analyze Aura</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>School </b>Divination; <b>Level </b>Medium 2, Mesmerist 3, Occultist 2, Psychic 3, Spiritualist 3</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S</p><p><b>Range </b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><b>Target </b>one creature or object</p><p><b>Duration </b>concentration, up to 1 round/level</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none; <b>Spell Resistance </b>no</p><p>You peer into the aura of one target creature or object, gaining valuable information about its condition and nature. Each round, choose one of the target's four auras. This spell functions similarly to the read aura occult skill unlock (see page 197), but doesn't require checks and returns results on all the target's auras in an instant.</p><p><b>Alignment Aura</b>: You study the target's spiritual nature to determine its alignment. You also learn the type and power of its alignment aura, as <i>detect evil</i>.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Emotion Aura</b>: The colors playing within the target's aura reveal its emotional state, granting valuable insight into its psyche. You learn a general summary of the target's current disposition, as well as its attitude toward any other creatures within 30 feet of it. For the duration of the spell and for 1 hour afterward, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks you attempt against the target. Objects do not have emotion auras, except intelligent weapons and similar sentient oddities.</p><p><b>Health Aura</b>: The flow of vital force animating the target becomes plainly visible, giving you insight into its physical condition. You know whether the target is unharmed or wounded, whether it is poisoned or diseased, and whether it is under any of the following conditions: confused, disabled, dying, nauseated, panicked, staggered, stunned, or unconscious. Further, your insight into the overall strength of the target's vital force reveals the total number of points available in its ki pool, grit pool, or similar resource. Objects and most undead creatures don't have health auras.</p><p><b>Magic Aura</b>: You determine the number and power of all magical auras on the target (as <i>detect magic </i>to determine a magic aura's power), as well as the school of each aura. You can attempt Knowledge (arcana) or Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school or identify properties of a magic item, as normal. If cast on an item, <i>analyze aura </i>cuts through the obfuscation of the <i>magic aura </i>spell.</p><h1>Anticipate Thoughts</h1><p><b>School </b>Divination [Mind-Affecting]; <b>Level </b>Bard 2, Inquisitor 2, Magus 2, Mesmerist 2, Psychic 2, Sorcerer/Wizard 2, Witch 2</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>V</p><p><b>Range </b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><b>Target </b>one creature</p><p><b>Duration </b>1 round/level</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will partial; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p><p>This spell taps into the target's mind so you get an impression of the actions it will take. You gain a +2 insight bonus to AC against the target's attacks. If the target fails its Will save, you also see how the target will react to your attacks, and the bonus applies on your attack rolls and damage rolls against the target. These bonuses apply only while the target is within range of the spell, though if it goes out of range, the bonuses return once it's back in range. Whenever the target misses you with an attack, the spell's bonuses increase by 1 until the spell ends (to a maximum of +5).</p><h1>Apport Animal</h1><p><b>School </b>Conjuration (Teleportation); <b>Level </b>Druid 3, Medium 3, Mesmerist 3, Psychic 3, Ranger 3, Sorcerer/Wizard 3, Summoner 3, Witch 3</p><p><b>Target </b>one touched animal of Tiny or smaller size</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p><p>This spell functions like <i>apport object </i>except the target is an animal. Only normal, nonmagical creatures of the animal type can be teleported.</p><h1>Apport Object</h1><p><b>School </b>Conjuration (Teleportation); <b>Level </b>Bard 2, Medium 2, Mesmerist 2, Occultist 2, Psychic 2, Sorcerer/Wizard 2, Witch 2</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>V</p><p><b>Range </b>touch</p><p><b>Target </b>one touched object of up to 1 lb. and 1 cu. ft.</p><p><b>Duration </b>instantaneous or 1 hour/level</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates (object); <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes (object)</p><p>This spell allows you to instantaneously transport a small nonliving object from one location to another. There are two ways to use the spell: sending allows you to immediately send an object held in your hands to a nearby location, while receiving permits you to cast the spell ahead of time on an object and summon it to your location at a later time.</p><p><b>Sending</b><i>: </i>If you choose to send the object elsewhere, the spell functions like <i>teleport object</i>, except the size of the object is limited and the distance it can travel is equal to only 25 feet + 5 feet per 2 levels. You can't transport an object to the Ethereal Plane. You can send the held object to any square within range, and you don't need line of sight to the target location. You can place the object in the open or inside a container, a pocket, or even someone's hand. If there isn't room in the space you select (either because the space chosen is too small or because there is already something else there), or if the person doesn't want or isn't expecting the object in his hands, it appears on the ground within the target's square instead. You can transport the object to an elevation above the floor as long as the destination is within the spell's total distance limit.</p><p><b>Receiving</b>: You can prepare an object ahead of time to apport it to yourself by casting the spell upon it and assigning a mental trigger to complete the spell. You don't need line of sight to the object to apport it to you, but the object must be within a distance equal to 25 feet + 5 feet per 2 levels. Completing the spell is a swift action that has the same restrictions as a thought spell component. You can apport an object in this way even if someone holding the object is unwilling to let you take it. Once you apport the object, the spell ends.</p><p>You can't send or receive an object into a space that is protected by an <i>antimagic field, globe of invulnerability, </i>or similar effect that keeps magical effects out; if you attempt to do so, the spell is lost.</p><h1>Aura Alteration</h1><p><b>School </b>Illusion; <b>Level </b>Medium 3, Mesmerist 3, Occultist 3, Psychic 4, Spiritualist 4</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S</p><p><b>Range </b>touch</p><p><b>Target </b>one object or willing creature</p><p><b>Duration </b>1 day/level (D)</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates (harmless, object); <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p><p>You mask and manipulate the target creature's or object's aura, confounding those who would attempt to discern helpful information from it using the read aura occult skill unlock (see page 197) or the <i>analyze aura </i>spell. You can change each of the following four auras with one casting of <i>aura alteration</i>.</p><p><b>Alignment Aura</b>: You can change the target's apparent alignment to thwart spells that detect alignment, such as <i>detect evil</i>. You can alter the alignment by up to one step on each alignment axis, but can't make the creature appear to have a diametrically opposed alignment. For instance, you couldn't make a lawful evil character appear to be chaotic or good. You can also adjust the power of the alignment aura up or down in level by a number of steps equal to 1/2 your level or fewer.</p><p><b>Emotion Aura</b>: Your manipulations mask the true emotionsof the target, instead depicting any combination of colors on the emotional spectrum that you wish. Creatures attempting Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Sense Motive checks against the target receive no bonuses on their checks based on information gleaned from the target's aura.</p><p><b>Health Aura</b>: You adulterate the target's aura to mask the condition of its physical body, revealing instead a wounded status, poison or disease status, and conditions of your choice. You likewise mask the target's available ki points or similar resources, manipulating its aura to suggest any number within the range normally available to the target.</p><p><b>Magic Aura</b>: You alter a creature or item's magic aura so that it registers to <i>detect magic </i>(and spells with similar capabilities, like <i>analyze aura</i>) as though it were nonmagical, a magic item of a kind you specify, or the subject of a spell you specify. A single casting of <i>aura alteration </i>is sufficient to mask all of the magic auras on the target. If an object bearing <i>aura alteration </i>has <i>identify </i>cast on it or is similarly examined, the examiner recognizes the aura is false and detects the object's actual qualities if he succeeds at a Will save. If a targeted item's own aura is overwhelming, <i>aura alteration </i>can't alter it.</p><h1>Aversion</h1><p><b>School </b>Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]; <b>Level </b>Bard 2, Druid 3, Mesmerist 2, Occultist 2, Psychic 2, Sorcerer/ Wizard 3, Witch 3</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S</p><p><b>Range </b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><b>Target </b>one creature</p><p><b>Duration </b>1 day/level</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will partial; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p><p>You plant a revulsion in the mind of the subject, causing her to avoid an object or location. You must choose a specific object or place. A location chosen in this way can be no larger than a cube measuring 50 feet on a side. The aversion is entirely in the target's mind, so the chosen object or location itself isn't subject to any magical effect. If the target fails her saving throw, she can't come within 60 feet of the chosen object or place. She makes every reasonable effort to avoid the object of the aversion, but will not put herself in danger in order to maintain the aversion. For example, if the object of the aversion is a bridge but a forest fire is closing in and will likely kill the target, she ignores the aversion and crosses the bridge to save herself. If the target must ignore the conditions of the aversion, she is nauseated until she is no longer violating the aversion.</p><p>If the target succeeds at her saving throw, she is instead sickened while within 60 feet of the object or place, but isn't compelled to stay away from it.</p><h1>Awaken Construct</h1><p><b>School </b>Transmutation; <b>Level </b>Cleric 7, Occultist 5, Psychic 6, Shaman 6, Sorcerer/Wizard 7</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>24 hours</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S, M (herbs and oils worth 2,000 gp per HD of target), DF</p><p><b>Range </b>touch</p><p><b>Target </b>mindless construct touched</p><p><b>Duration </b>instantaneous</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates; <b>Spell Resistance </b>no</p><p>You amplify the animating force of a construct to more closely resemble a true soul, granting the construct humanlike sentience. To do so, you must succeed at a Spellcraft check (DC = 15 + the construct's current Hit Dice). If the construct's master (if any) is present, this is an opposed Spellcraft check. You have no special empathy or connection with a creature you awaken-it is a free-willed creature. Golems previously under another creature's control, either as shield guardians or a golem crafter's creations, break all connections with that creature.</p><p>Roll 3d6 to determine the Intelligence score of the awakened construct, and increase its Charisma score by 2d6. It gains feats and skill points according to its new Intelligence score, and the skill points are assigned appropriately for its function, as determined by the GM.</p><p>An awakened construct speaks one language that its creator spoke, plus one additional language that its creator knew per point of the construct's Intelligence bonus (if any). Its alignment is determined by the GM, but is usually within one step of its creator's alignment. This spell doesn't function on a construct with an Intelligence score.</p><h1>Babble</h1><p><b>School </b>Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]; <b>Level </b>Bard 2, Mesmerist 2, Psychic 3, Sorcerer/Wizard 3, Witch 3</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S</p><p><b>Range </b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><b>Target </b>one creature; see text</p><p><b>Duration </b>1 round/level</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p><p>This spell causes the target to break into a fit of bizarre, uncontrollable babbling. The target also becomes nauseated. If the target succeeds at its save, the effects end. If not, the creature continues babbling and is nauseated for the entire duration.</p><p>Creatures within 30 feet of the subject that can hear the target's babbling must succeed at a W ill save or become fascinated for as long as the babbling persists. Once a creature's fascination ends, it can't become fascinated by the same instance of <i>babble </i>again.</p><p>Creatures with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower aren't affected by this spell.</p><h1>Bilocation</h1></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>School </b>Conjuration (Creation); <b>Level </b>Psychic 8, Sorcerer/Wizard 9</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>V</p><p><b>Range </b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><b>Effect </b>one duplicate</p><p><b>Duration </b>1 round/level (D)</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none; <b>Spell Resistance </b>no</p><p>The spell creates an identical copy of you, along with everything you wear and carry, anywhere you choose within range; you exist in two places at once until the spell ends. You and the duplicate use the same statistics and share the same resources. If the duplicate takes damage, for example, you deduct the damage from your hit point total. Similarly, if your duplicate expends a charge or daily use from a magic item you both wield, the charge or daily use is expended from the item you carry. If you or the duplicate drops or gives away something you're carrying, the item disappears from the other body as well. This spell doesn't duplicate artifacts; any you possess remain on you.</p><p>You perceive sensory information from your body and that of your duplicate simultaneously. The spell enables you to process the sensations so you don't find them disorienting.</p><p>When you take any action, you choose which of your bodies performs the action, but both bodies share the same pool of actions. For instance, if you take a standard action to cast a spell, you can use either body as the point of origin, but the other body can't also take a standard action that round. Likewise, if your duplicate takes a full-round action, you couldn't take a standard or move action. Both bodies can take any number of free actions as usual; for example, both bodies could say different things or each drop a different item. If either body doesn't move during the round, that body can either take a 5-foot step or move your speed once as a free action.</p><p>The two bodies are affected by attacks, spells, and effects as though they were one person, taking the worse effect when applicable (for example, if the bodies would be subject to differing effects due to being at different ranges). If both bodies are in the area of the same <i>fireball</i>, you would attempt the saving throw only once and take the damage only once. If one body is targeted by <i>hold person</i>, both would become paralyzed on a failed save. Both bodies count as a single creature for effects that target a specific number of creatures, and they can't be chosen more than once for such effects. You do count your other body as another creature for most combat effects, such as flanking or determining cover. However, you don't count as two unique creatures for the purposes of teamwork feats or effects you use that can target only creatures other than yourself.</p><p>Any magical effect with a duration affecting you has its duration halved while you're bilocating. For example, the <i>hold person </i>spell mentioned above would lose 2 rounds' worth of duration per round until your duplicate disappeared. If you were under an <i>eagle's splendor </i>effect that had 1 minute remaining when you cast <i>bilocation</i>, the effect would end after 5 rounds instead of 10. An effect shortened in this way lasts a minimum of 1 round total, and if an effect that lasts an odd number of rounds has 1 round remaining, it has its full effect on both of your bodies for that round.</p><p>When the spell ends, you decide whether you or your duplicate disappears. If you disappear, you become your duplicate. If you are carrying artifacts when you do this, they transfer with your consciousness.</p><h1>Burst Of Adrenaline</h1><p><b>School </b>Transmutation; <b>Level </b>Mesmerist 1, Psychic 1, Spiritualist 1</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 immediate action</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S</p><p><b>Range </b>personal</p><p><b>Target </b>you</p><p><b>Duration </b>instantaneous</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none; <b>Spell Resistance </b>no</p><p>You draw upon your body's inner reserves of strength, leaving you winded.

The spirit has the physical attributes of an <i>unseen servant </i>and is capable of minor physical manipulations, with the ability to speak in quiet, ghostly whispers in whatever languages the creature knew while it was alive. The spirit isn't an undead creature, and isn't beholden to its caller. Whether you summoned the chosen spirit or a deceitful replacement, the spirit can refuse to answer your questions or attempt to deceive you using Bluff, though in either case these spirits can speak about only what they knew in life and have no knowledge of events that occurred after their deaths. Malevolent spirits might take advantage of their limited physical abilities to cause terrifying spectacles designed to scare the caster.</p><p>You must concentrate on maintaining the spell (as a standard action) in order to ask questions at the rate of one per round. You can ask a total of one question per caster level; the spirit answers each during the same round. When the spell ends, the spirit's ectoplasmic form fades and the soul returns to its rest.

You have no control over the affected creatures, but <i>calm spirit </i>postpones hostile action by the affected spirits for the duration of the spell. Entities so affected cannot take violent actions or do anything destructive, including triggering persistent haunt abilities, though they can defend themselves. Any aggressive action against or damage dealt to a calmed spirit or haunt immediately ends the effect.</p><p>Haunts do not receive a saving throw against the spell, but the caster must succeed at a caster level check whose difficulty is equal to at least 10 + the haunt's CR in order to temporarily calm the angry entity.

The subject is helpless, and can still be killed normally.</p><p>Any effect that would bring the creature back to life or animate it as an undead fails, but ends the catatonia. The target can be affected by spells that affect only objects, including <i>animate objects </i>(if the creature is Small) and <i>teleport object</i>. However, anything that would cause the body to change form (such as <i>shrink item</i>) fails and ends the <i>catatonia</i>.

This slowing of movement doesn't stack with <i>solid fog </i>or similar effects. Creatures within <i>condensed ether </i>take a -2 penalty to Armor Class and on Reflex saves, and <i>condensed ether </i>prevents effective ranged weapon attacks. Even magic rays and similar ranged attacks suffer a 20% miss chance on attacks into or passing through <i>condensed ether</i>.

Once per round, the target can select one other creature to gain this bonus as well. The chosen creature can be no farther from the target than 25 feet + 5 feet for every 2 caster levels you possess, and a creature can't be selected more than once in this way. Such allies gain only the bonuses and temporary hit points; they don't continue to spread it to other creatures. The additional creatures' bonuses and temporary hit points share the original spell's duration, so when that duration ends, all affected creatures lose their bonuses and any remaining temporary hit points from this spell.</p><h1>Create Mindscape</h1><p><b>School </b>Illusion (Phantasm) [Mind-Affecting]; <b>Level </b>Medium 4, Mesmerist 4, Psychic 4, Sorcerer/Wizard 5</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 round</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S</p><p><b>Range </b>long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)</p><p><b>Target </b>one creature</p><p><b>Duration </b>10 minutes/level</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will disbelief; see text; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p><p>You create an immersive mindscape (see page 235) that the minds of both you and another creature enter together. You choose whether the mindscape is overt or veiled, and whether it's harmless or harmful. You can choose any shape and size trait, as well as any gravity trait (though you can't make it so the gravity is so strong it harms creatures within). The mindscape has normal time, no alignment traits, and normal magic.</p><p>You designate where both you and your subject appear. You don't need line of sight to draw the subject creature into the mindscape, but you must be aware of its presence within range. If you target an area with more than one sentient creature and you have never seen any of the creatures before (for example, if you know a group of soldiers is inside a barracks but you can't see them through the door), the subject of this spell is selected at random. If you have seen firsthand the creature you wish to target (continuing the example, if you spied the sergeant entering the room moments before), you can select it unerringly from among all the creatures. You must appear somewhere in your mindscape, though it's relatively easy to shield yourself from the view of any other creatures inside if they don't realize they're in a mindscape. You must also create a method of exit from the mindscape when you cast this spell, and that method must be possible to achieve based on the traits of the mindscape, even if it is obscure or difficult. The GM decides whether a method of escape is reasonable. Anything that would be a reasonable method of waking from a dream during deep sleep could allow one to leave a mindscape.</p><p>More creatures than the initial two can enter an existing mindscape, typically through the use of the <i>mindscape door </i>spell. You can create illusory creatures within the mindscape, but you're able to direct or concentrate on only one at a time. Only this creature is believable; any others largely remain silent or speak generic, repetitive phrases.</p><p>As is normal with mindscapes, you and any other creatures within the mindscape are unable to take actions within the real world, and your bodies lose their Dexterity bonuses to AC.</p><p>If you choose to create a veiled mindscape, the first time another creature interacts with the environment, it can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect. Disbelieving a mindscape reveals to that creature that it's within a mindscape and gives it the knowledge needed to leave the mindscape, but doesn't free it from the mindscape. For example, if you create a mindscape that takes the form of a parlor inside a stately mansion, and your target creature succeeds at its Will save, it gains the understanding that walking out the front door of the mansion allows it to return to its physical body, but it must actually move through the mental landscape of the mansion to reach the front door and exit in order to flee the mindscape. If the mindscape is overt, the creature automatically knows how to exit if it so chooses.</p><p>This spell ends at any time that you choose to depart the mindscape, freeing the target as well. Any creature that drops below 0 hit points while inside the mindscape returns to its body. If this happens to you, the spell also ends, freeing anyone still inside.</p><p><i>Create mindscape </i>can be made permanent with a <i>permanency </i>spell by a caster of 12th level or higher at a cost of 10,000 gp.

If the circumstances would prevent the target from repeating an action, such as if the target of its attack is dead or the target cannot cast the same spell again, the target instead becomes confused until the spell ends. A creature currently affected by <i>deja vu </i>can't be targeted with another <i>deja vu </i>spell.

If you're no longer adjacent to the creature when it has to give you the item, the spell ends with no effect. A creature that isn't holding an item when you cast this spell is unaffected.</p><h1>Detect Mindscape</h1><p><b>School </b>Divination; <b>Level </b>Medium 2, Mesmerist 2, Psychic 2, Sorcerer/Wizard 3</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S</p><p><b>Range </b>60 ft.</p><p><b>Area </b>cone-shaped emanation</p><p><b>Duration </b>concentration, up to 1 minute/level (D)</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates; see text; <b>Spell Resistance </b>no</p><p>This spell functions similarly to <i>detect thoughts, </i>allowing you to sense when one or more creatures' consciousnesses are inside a mindscape (see page 234). The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular subject.</p><p><b>First Round</b>: You sense the presence or absence of a mindscape. At least one of the creatures inside the mindscape must be within the cone-shaped area for you to detect the mindscape.</p><p><b>Second Round</b>: You sense the number of consciousnesses inside the mindscape. Not all of the creatures within the mindscape must be standing inside the cone-shaped area of the spell for you to count them; only one is required to get this reading. However, you can't determine the location of the creatures if you can't see the creatures themselves. You sense their presence only in an abstract way.</p><p><b>Third Round</b>: You sense an image of what's taking place inside the mindscape. The creature controlling the mindscape can sense your efforts, and if it does not wish you to view the mindscape, it can prevent this viewing with a successful Will save. Otherwise, you perceive the visuals remotely, as if watching through a window. If a creature has disguised itself, you see only the creature's mental mask (not its true form).</p><p>Each round, you can turn to detect mindscapes in a new area. The spell can penetrate many barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.</p><p>If you are within a mindscape when you cast this spell, you become aware you're in a mindscape. On the second round, you can still detect how many consciousnesses are inside, but you don't get the image of the mindscape in the third round.</p><h1>Detect Psychic Significance</h1><p><b>School </b>Divination; <b>Level </b>Medium 0, Mesmerist 0, Occultist 0, Psychic 0, Spiritualist 0</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S</p><p><b>Range </b>40 ft.</p><p><b>Area </b>40-ft.-radius burst, centered on you</p><p><b>Duration </b>instantaneous</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none; <b>Spell Resistance </b>no</p><p>You detect the presence of psychically significant items in your vicinity. Such items are those that might have significant psychic imprints or histories that can be read by the psychometry occult skill unlock (see page 196), or items under the effects of the <i>charge object </i>or <i>implant false reading </i>spells. Items within range that contain significant psychic energy spark a recognition in your mind's eye, but no other information is imparted. This spell doesn't automatically detect magic items or strongly aligned items, though such items often have storied histories and might have had previous owners who possessed psychic abilities.</p><h1>Divide Mind</h1><p><b>School </b>Enchantment [Mind-Affecting]; <b>Level </b>Psychic 9</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>V</p><p><b>Range </b>personal</p><p><b>Target </b>you</p><p><b>Duration </b>1 minute</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none; <b>Spell Resistance </b>no</p><p>You partition your mind to maximize your mental power. Until the spell ends, you roll twice and use the higher result for all Will saves, Intelligence checks, and Intelligence-based skill checks. In addition, as a swift action you can have your second mind perform any purely mental action that normally requires a standard action or a move action. This includes casting psychic spells, using spell-like abilities, and concentrating on spells. Spells and spell-like abilities cast or used by your secondary mind this way can't exceed 5th level.</p><h1>Dream Council</h1><p><b>School </b>Illusion (Phantasm) [Mind-Affecting]; <b>Level </b>Bard 6, Medium 4, Mesmerist 5, Psychic 6, Sorcerer/Wizard 7</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S</p><p><b>Range </b>unlimited</p><p><b>Target </b>one or more living creatures</p><p><b>Duration </b>see text</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p><p>This spell functions as <i>dream</i>, but you and the target of your <i>dream </i>can converse in a limited fashion as long as the recipient is also asleep. You can send or receive a number of dream messages equal to your caster level. Each message can be up to 25 words long or a single vague image that can't convey fine details such as words. You can send and receive these dream messages with a single target or multiple targets, but each message you send or receive counts against the total number of messages allowed. Sending a message takes 1 round. The spell ends and you wake up when you run out of messages.</p><p>If you use <i>dream council </i>to send a message to a sleeping creature that has <i>dream </i>or <i>dream council </i>prepared (or is able to cast it spontaneously or as a spell-like ability), the recipient can expend one of your allotted messages to cast that spell while remaining asleep. This uses up that creature's prepared spell, spell per day, or spell-like ability use as normal. Instead of replying to your message, that character is able to enter your dreamscape. If the sleeping recipient has the Lucid Dreamer feat, it can enter your dreamscape without casting either of those spells. While in the original caster's dreamscape, those involved in the council can interact with one another and that dreamscape for 10 minutes for each message remaining. When that time elapses, the spell ends.</p><h1>Dream Scan</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>School </b>Divination [Mind-Affecting]; <b>Level </b>Bard 6, Medium 4, Mesmerist 5, Psychic 5, Sorcerer/Wizard 6</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S</p><p><b>Range </b>unlimited</p><p><b>Target </b>one living creature</p><p><b>Duration </b>see text</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p><p>This spell functions as <i>dream</i>, but rather than sending a message to a sleeping target, you can instead read the target's thoughts. The target must be asleep for you to perform a <i>dream scan</i>, though if the target isn't asleep, you can wait in a trance until your target falls asleep.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Once the target is asleep, you can concentrate in order to read its surface thoughts as if using <i>detect thoughts</i>. You can continue concentrating for up to 1 minute per caster level.</p><p>Instead of reading surface thoughts, you can choose to scan the target's dreams and subconscious mind for the answers to questions. For every minute you spend concentrating, you can obtain the answer to one question, though the answers might be brief, cryptic, or repetitive. The target is entitled to a new Will save to end the <i>dream scan </i>each time you ask it a question. Otherwise, the creature can attempt a Bluff check with a DC equal to 11 + your Sense Motive modifier. If it fails its Bluff check, you gain the information you desire. If it succeeds at its check, you gain no information. If it succeeds at its check by 5 or more, you misinterpret the target's dreams- you draw a false conclusion of the target's choice and believe that wrong answer to be true.</p><p>Unlike with <i>dream, </i>you can't cast this spell on another creature to have it serve as your messenger.</p><h1>Dream Travel</h1><p><b>School </b>Conjuration (Teleportation) [Mind-Affecting]; <b>Level </b>Mesmerist 6, Psychic 6</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S</p><p><b>Range </b>touch</p><p><b>Target </b>you and one creature/level</p><p><b>Duration </b>1 hour/level (D)</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p><p>You and the other targets of the spell are physically drawn from the Material Plane into the Dimension of Dreams on a voyage into the dreams of a creature you designate. In the Dimension of Dreams, you move through a swirling sea of thoughts, desires, and emotions created by the minds of dreamers everywhere to reach your destination dreamscape. Reaching the destination dreamscape takes 1 hour. At any point before the spell's duration ends, you can dismiss the spell to return to where you started on the Material Plane. The connection between dreams and reality is inherently tenuous, and your ability to arrive precisely where you mean to is dependent on your familiarity with the dreamer you're trying to find. To determine how accurate your arrival is at the end of your <i>dream travel, </i>roll d% on the following table.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Familiarity</b></td><td><b>On Target</b></td><td><b>Off Target</b></td><td><b>Other</b></td><td><b>Dreamscape Mishap</b></td></tr><tr><td>Very familiar</td><td>1-97</td><td>98-99</td><td>100</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Somewhat familiar</td><td>1-94</td><td>95-97</td><td>98-99</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Known creature</td><td>1-88</td><td>89-94</td><td>95-98</td><td>99-100</td></tr><tr><td>Not well known</td><td>1-76</td><td>77-88</td><td>89-96</td><td>97-100</td></tr><tr><td>False identity</td><td>-</td><td>1-80</td><td>81-92</td><td>93-100</td></tr></table><listlink><p>@RollTable[BmGatYMcYLPT3KvI]Very Familiar (rollable)</p><p>@RollTable[z9nVkQNwE12gfbxQ]Somewhat Familiar (rollable)</p><p>@RollTable[7Wzcqy7AqNsOiB1w]Well Known Creature (rollable)</p><p>@RollTable[Qp4OCFT6vch7lgEO]Not Well Known (rollable)</p><p>@RollTable[D7MD3ZQSPAiQz99z]False identity (rollable)</p></listlink></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Familiarity</b>: \"Very familiar\" means that you have had contact using <i>dream</i>, <i>dream council</i>, <i>dream scan</i>, or a similar spell within the past 24 hours with the creature whose dreamscape you are trying to locate. \"Somewhat familiar\" means that you have had contact with the dreaming character using one of those spells at least once in the past. \"Known creature\" means that while you know the creature whose dreamscape you're trying to locate, you have not connected to its dreams with those spells. \"Not well known\" is a creature you have heard of, know by name and true identity, but have never met.</p><p>\"False identity\" means that whether or not you have met the creature, you know it only through a false identity. When trying to locate the dreamscape of a creature known to you through a false identity, roll 1d20 + 80 on the table to obtain your results (instead of rolling d%), since there is no way for you to pinpoint the correct dreamscape.</p><p><b>On Target</b>: You travel to the correct creature's current dreamscape.</p><p><b>Off Target</b>: You travel to an area near the target dreamscape on the Ethereal Plane.</p><p><b>Other Dreamscape</b>: You travel to a similar creature's dreamscape on the Dimension of Dreams.</p><p><b>Mishap</b>: You and anyone else traveling with you experience a mishap during travel; each character takes 1d10 points of damage and must reroll on the table to see where it ends up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20 + 80. Each time \"Mishap\" comes up, the travelers take more damage and must reroll to see where they end up.</p><p>Regardless of the accuracy of your <i>dream travel</i>, you and your companions all arrive at the same location (except in the case of a mishap). Mindless creatures can't use <i>dream travel, </i>nor can creatures that can't dream.</p><p>You might be able to exit the dream near the creature on its home plane. If you and the other creatures are still in a dream when the dreamer wakes up, the dreamer can decide to bring you out onto its plane within 1d10 miles of itself. If it chooses not to, you and the other travelers are pushed into another dreamscape or onto the Ethereal Plane. The spell ends when the creature wakes up, so you no longer have the option to dismiss the spell and return home. However, you do get enough warning that a spell is about to end that you can dismiss it before the dreamer awakens and decides whether to allow you to arrive at its location.</p><p>You can use <i>dream travel </i>to travel to the dream of a creature on another plane, but this requires trekking through the dreams of outsiders. It takes 1d4+1 hours of uninterrupted travel to reach the destination dream, and each traveler must succeed at a Will save each hour spent traveling in this fashion. The DC of this save is 10 for the first hour, and increases by 5 for each hour thereafter. If a creature fails this saving throw, it becomes shaken for the remainder of the <i>dream travel </i>and for a number of hours thereafter equal to the amount of time spent using <i>dream travel </i>to reach the destination plane. After the first time a creature fails the saving throw, one of the following effects occurs (determined randomly by the GM). These effects are considered emotion effects, in addition to any other descriptors that apply.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td colspan=\"2\"><b>d6</b></td><td colspan=\"10\"><b>Result</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">1</td><td colspan=\"10\">Creature contracts cackle fever or mindfire (equal chance of either</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">2</td><td colspan=\"10\">Creature is cursed, as bestow curse</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">3</td><td colspan=\"10\">Creature is attacked by a phantasmal killer, and is treated as having failed the initial saving throw to disbelieve it.

If you exit a creature's dream onto a plane different from the plane you started on, you end up in a random location on the destination plane.</p><p>If the target of your <i>dream travel </i>isn't dreaming, you and the other travelers can wait on the Dimension of Dreams until that creature begins sleeping. For each hour that passes during this wait, each dream traveler must attempt a Will save as if it were traveling to reach another plane.</p><h1>Dream Voyage</h1></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>School </b>Conjuration (Teleportation) [Mind-Affecting]; <b>Level </b>Psychic 9</p><p>This spell functions as <i>dream travel</i>, but you and your companions travel through the Dimension of Dreams in a fantastical vehicle of your own devising that halves the travel time. Only you can pilot the vessel, and you can do so even if you aren't inside it. Your psychic vehicle buffers minds from the intense emotional tides of the Dimension of Dreams, rendering everyone inside immune to harmful emotion and fear effects. Unlike with <i>dream travel</i>, there is no chance the vessel arrives off target. In addition, you need not have met the target creature, but in that case you must have at least a reliable description of it. However, if you attempt to travel there with insufficient or incorrect information, you do need to roll, using the false identity entry from <i>dream travel</i>.</p><p>Creatures that disembark from your vehicle can either enter the dreamscape or exit to the plane where the dreamer's body lies, arriving within 1 mile of the dreamer's body. All creatures that disembark from the vehicle onto a plane at the same time arrive in the same place. The dreamer can't prevent the dream voyagers from entering its dream, but can attempt a Will save to prevent a group of creatures from exiting to the plane where its body resides.</p><p>The psychic vehicle remains in the dream for the remainder of the spell's duration, even if it's unoccupied. A creature adjacent to the dreamer can reenter the dream vessel as a full-round action through an illusory portal only subjects of the spell can see. You can return the vessel to the point where you cast <i>dream voyage </i>to allow any number of passengers to return to that plane, and can return it to the dream again. Either of these trips takes the same amount of time as the initial travel, and can be done any number of times within the spell's duration. If the vessel moves out of a dreamscape, companions left behind can't return to the vessel by being near the dreamer. If a companion is killed, its body doesn't return to the <i>dream voyage </i>unless you carry it with you, just like any other object.</p><p>If the dreamer awakens while the dream vessel is still in its dream, it can allow the dream travelers to exit or not (as with <i>dream travel</i>). The dream vessel remains intact in the Dimension of Dreams for the spell's duration even if it's untethered from a dream. It drifts through dreams when this happens, and you can't pilot it to another dream (even a dream of the initial dreamer if that creature begins dreaming again). If you dismiss the spell at any time, you and all subjects within the dream vessel return to where you started on the Material Plane.</p><p>You can increase the number of companions you can bring on a <i>dream voyage </i>to 10 creatures per caster level, though to do so you must increase the casting time, maintaining your concentration and touching up to 6 creatures per round as a full-round action. If your concentration is disrupted before you touch all of the targets, the spell is wasted and has no effect. Once you have touched all of your companions, the <i>dream voyage </i>begins; however, its duration is reduced to 1 hour.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter4psychicmagic\">^Psychic Magic</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter5occultrules\">Occult Rules</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"aZJR5AvjisYaiDaB"}

Instead of construction information, each artifact includes one possible means by which it might be destroyed.</p><p>Artifacts should never be purchased or found as part of a random treasure hoard. When placing an artifact in your game, be sure to consider its impact, but also keep in mind that artifacts are fickle objects, and if they become too much of a nuisance, they can easily become lost once more.</p><p>Minor Artifacts</p><p>The artifacts presented here are all minor artifacts. Minor artifacts are not necessarily unique items. Even so, they are magic items that can no longer be created by common mortal means.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>PORTAL NETWORK</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>SLOT</b> none <b>CL</b> 20th <b>WEIGHT</b> 64,000 lbs.</p><p><b>AURA</b> strong conjuration</p><p>Runes adorn this massive ring of iron. Each gate of a <i>portal network </i>is bound to at least one other such gate and instantly transports any creature who steps through it to its mate, anywhere on the same plane or any other plane. <i>Portal network </i>gates allow the passage of Large or smaller creatures. Huge creatures are not transported, even if they manage to squeeze through the ring. If the destination gate is obstructed by an immovable object, the network fails to function.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><i>Portal networks </i>with more than two gates distinguish between destinations via focal objects chosen by the gates' creators. Typical focal objects include gems, minor magic items, and carefully drawn sigils. Some gates fail to function at all if entered without a focal object, whereas others transport the subject to a default location. Creatures can share a focal object by touching each other as they pass through the gate. Gates with multiple focal objects have a set priority (established at the creation of the <i>portal network</i>) that determines which focal objects supersede the others.</p><p><i>Portal networks </i>work an unlimited number of times. Once a gate is activated, impenetrable darkness fills the gate's ring until 1 round after the last creature passes through. A creature doesn't reach the other end until it passes fully through the ring, and can't see the other side until it finishes passing through.</p><p>If a <i>portal network </i>requires a focal object, only creatures using a focal object or touching someone else who is can pass through a gate, even if the gate is activated. Obstructing a gate (such as by building a wall against the gate's opening) prevents anyone from passing through, but a creature standing in the way does not; a creature occupying the gate is pushed aside once anyone passes through.</p><h1>DESTRUCTION</h1><p>Destroying a <i>portal network </i>entirely requires sending a <i>sphere of annihilation </i>through one of the network's gates. This destroys the sphere as well (as described in the destruction requirements for a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>), except a gap is always torn in the spatial fabric.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>PRIMORDIAL SYMBOL</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>SLOT</b> none <b>CL</b> 20th <b>WEIGHT</b> 1 lb.</p><p><b>AURA</b> strong abjuration</p><p>Its origin lost in the infinite expanse of time, a <i>primordial symbol </i>is a polished stone bearing a mystic sign that resembles a lopsided, two-barred cross. When held forth and invoked by a bearer who is able to cast psychic spells or has the Psychic Sensitivity feat, a <i>primordial symbol </i>flares with an invisible flash in a 100-foot-radius burst, which has the following effects on those in range.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><list><p><li>Creatures with 40 Hit Dice or fewer with the extraplanar subtype are returned to their home planes as though by the <i>banishment </i>spell, regardless of spell resistance and with no save permitted.

When the symbol is activated, its wielder takes 2d6 points of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma damage, rolled separately for each ability. The <i>primordial symbol </i>then collapses in on itself and vanishes, only to reappear unharmed in a distant land or world.</p><h1>DESTRUCTION</h1><p>Though seemingly destroyed by activation, the eldritch potential bound into a <i>primordial symbol </i>persists and recreates the symbol elsewhere in the multiverse. To permanently destroy the artifact, the <i>primordial symbol </i>must be brought to a realm of pure chaos at the unformed edges of the Outer Planes and melted in the primal energy of creation.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>SOUL PORTRAIT</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>SLOT</b> none <b>CL</b> 20th <b>WEIGHT</b> 25 lbs.</p><p><b>AURA</b> strong necromancy</p><p>A <i>soul portrait </i>is a painting imbued with immense magical power attached to a solid wooden frame. The exact image presented on each <i>soul portrait </i>varies, and has a magical effect only if it depicts the likeness of its current owner. The owner doesn't need to be depicted alone, and additional figures painted in the background don't interfere with the effect.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>The owner of a <i>soul portrait </i>doesn't appear to age and no longer takes the penalties associated with aging, but she still gains the appropriate mental bonuses. As the owner would normally age, the portrait appears to age instead. The owner of a <i>soul portrait </i>does not die of old age. If someone benefitting from this effect ceases to be the portrait's owner, she immediately gains all associated physical penalties from her current age, and her appearance changes appropriately; if the owner is past her maximum age, she withers and dies instantly.</p><p>When scrutinized by magical means (such as <i>aura sight</i>(ACG), <i>detect evil</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, or <i>discern lies</i>), the owner gains the benefits of a special <i>misdirection </i>with no saving throw allowed for the would-be investigator. For the purposes of the <i>misdirection</i>, the <i>soul portrait </i>provides results as the owner would have when she first acquired the portrait. Unlike a normal <i>misdirection</i>, this effect is not limited to spells that detect her aura. Whenever it would be beneficial to her, the owner counts as her younger self for any spell or effect that gathers information. For instance, if she denies committing a crime she perpetrated after she commissioned the portrait, all forms of truth magic would reveal her denial as being true. Even spells like <i>detect thoughts </i>would reveal the thoughts of her younger self.</p><p>When the portrait's owner would take ability damage, ability drain, or negative levels, she takes no adverse effects until they would be fatal (though she continues to accrue them in the portrait), and her image on the <i>soul portrait </i>twists in horrific agony as if suffering for its owner. Whenever any of the accrued maladies would be fatal (such as a number of negative levels equal to the owner's Hit Dice), the owner immediately dies. The <i>soul portrait </i>can be healed of ability damage, ability drain, and negative levels to reduce the accrued maladies by any effects that would normally heal these maladies.</p><p>When the owner of a <i>soul portrait </i>dies, her soul is pulled into the canvas and her likeness becomes a character in the background, leaving space for a new portrait. A creature can claim ownership over a <i>soul portrait </i>by commissioning an artist to paint her likeness over the original image. The new owner must be present and willing while the artist paints<i>, </i>and the artist must succeed at a DC 25 Craft (painting) check to create a sufficient likeness for the artifact to accept the new owner. Once this happens, if the previous owner is still alive, she ceases to be the <i>soul portrait</i>'s owner and ages as described above. The portrait can't be cut, burned, or otherwise damaged, except as described in the destruction requirements below.</p><h1>DESTRUCTION</h1><p>A <i>soul portrait </i>can be destroyed only by its current owner. The owner must slay the artist who painted her likeness onto the portrait, and then use the same weapon to destroy the portrait.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>STANNUM CROWN</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>SLOT</b> head <b>CL</b> 15th <b>WEIGHT</b> 2 lbs.</p><p><b>AURA</b> strong abjuration</p><p>Though polished to a silvery gleam, the metal of this velvet-capped crown is simple tin. Occult scholars believe the first <i>stannum crowns </i>were created by a mad psychic king who had become convinced that entities from other planes were watching and plotting against him.</p><p>The crown is powered by its wearer's paranoia and mistrust, using them to grant the wearer immunity to mind-affecting effects and divinations that gather information about him. The wearer can't lower this immunity without removing the crown. Donning a <i>stannum crown </i>saps the wearer's mind, imposing a -2 penalty to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Removing the crown negates the penalty, but the wearer's enhanced paranoia makes him unwilling to doff the headdress. He can try to remove the crown once per day by attempting a Will save (DC = 25 + the number of consecutive days the crown has been worn). Once the DC becomes 35 or higher, the wearer's paranoia has progressed to the point where he no longer treats any other creature as an ally and attempts saving throws against even harmless spells and abilities. At this point, a natural 20 is not an automatic success on the saving throw to remove the crown, and the wearer never counts as a willing target for the purposes of another's spell or ability, even when he is unconscious. Other creatures can't remove the crown by force; only the wearer can take it off.</p><h1>DESTRUCTION</h1><p>A <i>stannum crown </i>can be destroyed only by placing it on the head of a sentient being who is truly incapable of mistrust. This destroys the crown, but leaves the creature with the powers and drawbacks of the crown, forever unable to remove or ameliorate them.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>THOUGHT RECORD</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>SLOT</b> none <b>CL</b> 15th <b>WEIGHT</b> 2 lbs.</p><p><b>AURA</b> strong divination</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Though this tube resembles a simple copper pipe, its exotic metal reshapes the flow of time itself. A <i>thought record </i>measures 1 foot in length, and despite its light weight, it resists sudden acceleration as if it were a heavy, massive tree trunk. Intricate patterns are etched inside the tube, constantly shifting into new configurations that never repeat. <i>Thought records </i>store and replay memories, absorbing the entirety of a person's experience in an instant. These memories remain in the <i>thought record </i>indefinitely and can't be altered, though subsequent recordings from the same individual can be added. <i>Thought records </i>absorb such imprints unpredictably, with no indication of when the artifact will trigger or how to activate it deliberately. When the <i>thought record </i>records a life, its etched metal surface fades, appearing instead as a tiny window into a cosmic starscape. No known limit exists as to how many sets of memories a single <i>thought record </i>can hold.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Memories stored in a <i>thought record </i>can be used along with reality-altering magic such as <i>miracle </i>or <i>wish </i>to bring back those irrevocably lost to death. Opinions differ on whether this amounts to an exotic <i>resurrection </i>or if it overwrites a newborn soul with the experiences of another.</p><p>A <i>thought record </i>can allow its holder to experience portions of another's life in an instant. It is unclear what act triggers this replay, though most commonly it happens immediately when a creature first touches the device. When the <i>thought record </i>replays the past, the holder experiences the memories stored in the device not just as though she were present, but as if she were consciously making the choices herself.</p><p>Occult researchers speculate that <i>thought records </i>create conduits to the Akashic Record, and that experiencing memories stored within such a rod brings the consciousness of the holder into the past of another person, forming a gestalt of their minds. This gestalt experiences and affects the events as they took place, not merely when they were recorded. According to this theory, those experiencing a memory don't merely observe another's life-they take a role in shaping it. Some even suspect that a <i>thought record </i>can share memories that have yet to be stored. Whatever the explanation, the experiences of the <i>thought record </i>are so total that the creature living the memories suffers from any mental conditions suffered in the memories, such as insanity, damage to mental ability scores, and mind-affecting effects.</p><p>Although a <i>thought record </i>can record the memories of many individuals, it almost never replays more than one creature's memories for a single user. Instead, later activations by that user replay other memories from the same creature, revealing more of its life. Repeated activation takes the user through another's life in bursts of instantaneous visions. The <i>thought record </i>does not replay recorded memories in sequential order. Instead, it skips back and forth across the life of the recorder, with later activations shedding light on earlier activations, regardless of their chronological order.</p><p>The same temporal effects that let a <i>thought record </i>transmit memories across time render it nearly invulnerable to physical harm. Both the rod and the memories stored within resist any attempts at destruction or alteration.</p><h1>DESTRUCTION</h1><p>A <i>thought record </i>can be destroyed by causing it to absorb the memories of a senile god.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"f4G7fqDSS1gnK8Bj"}

It must attempt this Will save regardless of whether it succeeded at the Reflex save. An incorporeal creature pushed partially onto the Material Plane can't enter or pass through solid objects, takes half damage from nonmagical attack forms, and takes full damage from magic weapons, spells, spell-like effects, and supernatural effects. Corporeal spells and effects that don't cause damage affect the creature normally instead of having a 50% chance of affecting it.

You must make a ranged touch attack to strike a target. If you hit, the target can attempt a Reflex save. On a successful save, the target is entangled for the duration of the spell and suffers no other effects. If the target fails this saving throw, the tendril is more restrictive, making the target grappled and dealing it 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage. Each round when you concentrate to maintain the spell, the snare attempts a grapple combat maneuver check to maintain the grapple. As normal when grappling, the snare gains a +5 bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks against opponents it is already grappling. The snare's CMB is equal to 6 + your caster level, and its CMD is equal to 16 + your caster level. Since the ectoplasm passes between planes, this spell affects incorporeal and ethereal creatures normally.</p><p>You remain tethered to the target for the duration of the spell. You can shrink or extend the snare, but if the distance between you and the target exceeds the spell's range, the snare disappears. The ectoplasmic tether has hardness 10 and a number of hit points equal to 10 + your caster level + your Constitution modifier, and the tether can be damaged or sundered anywhere along its length. You are not considered to have the grappled condition while tethered to the target.

Only spells that detect or alter your thoughts or memories are blocked by this spell; effects such as <i>clairaudience/clairvoyance</i>, <i>detect evil</i>, and <i>locate creature </i>continue to affect you as normal.</p><h1>Entrap Spirit</h1><p><b>School </b>Necromancy; <b>Level </b>Medium 4, Occultist 5, Psychic 5, Spiritualist 4</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S, f(a small silver mirror)</p><p><b>Range </b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><b>Target </b>incorporeal creature or haunt</p><p><b>Duration </b>1 hour/level (D)</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p><p>You trap the target in the mirror used as the spell's focus. The target cannot be affected by any means while inside the mirror. If the mirror is destroyed, any incorporeal creature within is immediately freed and any haunt within returns to its original location. Creatures that assumed incorporeal form through a spell or other means remain incorporeal while trapped, even if the duration of the effect that rendered them incorporeal expires. If your focus mirror belonged to the target, the target takes a -2 penalty on its saving throw.</p><h1>Erase Impressions</h1><p><b>School </b>Abjuration; <b>Level </b>Medium 3, Mesmerist 4, Occultist 3, Psychic 5, Spiritualist 4</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 round</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S</p><p><b>Range </b>touch</p><p><b>Target </b>object touched</p><p><b>Duration </b>instantaneous</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates (object); <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes (object)</p><p>You banish psychic impressions from the object touched, rendering it devoid of recent history. You choose how much time to erase, up to a maximum of 1 day per caster level. You must erase impressions from the present time back; you cannot choose to leave recent events untouched. Impressions erased in this manner cannot be recovered via <i>object reading</i>, <i>legend lore</i>, or similar measures.</p><p>Casting <i>erase impressions </i>on a corpse removes recent psychic impressions from when the creature was alive as well, making those memories unavailable to <i>speak with dead</i>. For example, a 5th-level caster casting the spell on a 2-day-old corpse could erase the past 2 days of psychic impressions from the corpse and 3 additional days of information from just before the creature died.</p><h1>Ethereal Envelope</h1><p><b>School </b>Conjuration (Teleportation); <b>Level </b>Psychic 5, Spiritualist 4</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>S, M (empty crystal box)</p><p><b>Range </b>personal</p><p><b>Target </b>you</p><p><b>Duration </b>1 hour/level (D)</p><p>You place yourself into a cataleptic meditative state and shunt yourself to the Ethereal Plane, where your body is cocooned within a folded ripple of misty space, with total cover from creatures on the Ethereal Plane<i>. </i>While inside your <i>ethereal envelope, </i>you are treated as being asleep for most purposes. You can choose an amount of time within the duration when casting this spell, and you automatically dismiss the spell when that time elapses. Your <i>ethereal envelope </i>counts as an object of your size with AC 10, hardness 5, and hit points equal to twice your level, and it is immune to bludgeoning damage. An attacker must be on the Ethereal Plane or have a way to see ethereal objects in order to detect your <i>ethereal envelope</i>. The envelope can also be broken open with a successful Strength check with a DC equal to 15 + your caster level (to a maximum DC of 30). If the <i>ethereal envelope </i>is destroyed, the spell ends immediately.</p><p>When the spell ends, you remain asleep without the protection of the envelope for 1 round. At the end of that round, you are shunted back to the Material Plane at the location where you cast the spell, and you are staggered for 1 round as you reorient yourself to the Material Plane. You can't use this spell to travel from your location on the Ethereal Plane. If the space you formerly occupied is now occupied by another creature or object, you are shunted to the nearest open space and take 1d10 points of damage.</p><h1>Ethereal Envelopment</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>School </b>Conjuration (Teleportation); <b>Level </b>Psychic 7, Spiritualist 5</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>S, M (empty crystal box)</p><p><b>Range </b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><b>Target </b>one creature</p><p><b>Duration </b>1 hour/level (D)</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates, see text; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>This spell is similar to <i>ethereal envelope, </i>but it allows you to shunt an unwilling creature to the Ethereal Plane and seal it there within a cocoon of misty ethereal fibers. If the target fails its save, it's forced into a cataleptic meditative state as if unconscious. However, each round at the end of its turn, it can attempt a Will save to awaken itself from this meditation. Once the target awakens, it is considered pinned, treating your caster level as your CMB and your CMD as 10 + your caster level + your ability modifier for your primary spellcasting ability score. A successful grapple combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check leaves the creature grappled rather than pinned but doesn't allow it to escape. However, a trapped creature can attack the cocoon as described in the <i>ethereal envelope </i>spell description.</p><p>If the creature breaks free of the <i>ethereal envelopment </i>or you dismiss the spell, the target is returned to its prior location on the Material Plane, as described for <i>ethereal envelope</i>, but if the target is conscious at the time, it doesn't spend a round asleep or staggered.</p><h1>Ethereal Fists</h1><p><b>School </b>Transmutation; <b>Level </b>Magus 4, Spiritualist 3</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>S</p><p><b>Range </b>personal</p><p><b>Target </b>you</p><p><b>Duration </b>1 minute/level (D)</p><p>Your hands reach simultaneously into the Ethereal and Material planes, allowing you to deal normal damage with claws, unarmed strikes, and touch spells or effects to ethereal creatures.

Movement through an area of <i>etheric shards </i>is halved, even for incorporeal creatures, and creatures entering a 5-foot cube filled with <i>etheric shards </i>take 1d8 points of piercing and slashing damage and must succeed at a Reflex save or take 1 point of bleed damage. This bleed damage stacks with itself and other sources of bleed damage. A creature standing within an area of <i>etheric shards </i>takes no damage as long as it remains completely motionless, but even the minor movements involved in attacking or defending in combat force a stationary creature to attempt a Reflex save. If a stationary creature succeeds at this save, it avoids damage completely for that round, but if it fails, it takes hit point damage and bleed damage as though it had moved through the square.</p><p>A creature forcibly moved through an area of <i>etheric shards</i>, such as by a bull rush or drag combat maneuver, takes a -4 penalty on its saving throw, but a creature able to see invisible or ethereal objects gains a +4 bonus, and damage to it is completely negated on a successful Reflex save.</p><p><i>Etheric shards </i>are considered a magical trap, and a creature with trapfinding can use Perception to find them. The DC of this check is equal to 25 + the spell's level. <i>Etheric shards </i>can't be disabled with the Disable Device skill.</p><h1>Explode Head</h1><p><b>School </b>Evocation; <b>Level </b>Magus 6, Psychic 5, Sorcerer/Wizard 6</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S <b>Range </b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><b>Target </b>one living corporeal creature</p><p><b>Duration </b>instantaneous</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>special; see text; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p><p>You cause incredible pressure to build in the target's head; this spell works only on a creature that has a head and would die from the loss of a head. The spell kills any such target that has 20 hit points or fewer, exploding its head and spreading debris in a 10-foot radius. Each creature in the area must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or take 2d6 points of slashing damage from the flying debris.</p><p>A target with more than 20 hit points takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6), but can attempt a Fortitude save to take only half damage. If this damage would cause the target to become disabled or dying, the target dies and its head explodes as described above.</p><h1>Foster Hatred</h1><p><b>School </b>Enchantment (Compulsion) [Emotion]; <b>Level </b>Antipaladin 4, Inquisitor 5, Mesmerist 5, Psychic 6, Spiritualist 5</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>S, DF</p><p><b>Range </b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><b>Target </b>any number of living creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart</p><p><b>Duration </b>1 hour/level (D)</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p><p>You build upon your targets' innate prejudice, stoking it from a simmer to the full flame of hatred.

Targets who hold no ill will toward and have a completely positive opinion of the chosen creatures automatically succeed at their saving throws, while targets with a particular hatred toward the chosen creature (such as the dwarf's hatred racial ability) take a -4 penalty on their saving throws. Targets that fail their saving throws become hostile toward all creatures of the chosen type and never treat them as allies for the spell's duration. Affected creatures take everything creatures of the chosen type do in the worst possible light.</p><p>Since most creatures don't hold ill-will toward their own race, you can use <i>foster hatred </i>toward a smaller subset of creatures of your chosen type, such as worshipers of Shelyn, in order to focus the hatred onto your chosen targets.</p><h1>Ghost Whip</h1><p><b>School </b>Evocation; <b>Level </b>Cleric 2, Inquisitor 2, Magus 2, Occultist 2, Psychic 2, Sorcerer/Wizard 2, Spiritualist 2, Witch 2</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S</p><p><b>Range </b>0 ft.</p><p><b>Effect </b>whip of flexible ectoplasm</p><p><b>Duration </b>1 round/level (D)</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p><p>A white, 15-foot-long lash of ghostly evanescence appears from your hand. This weapon is treated as a <i>ghost touch whip </i>with no enhancement bonus. You can wield it as a whip as if you were proficient. Attacks with a <i>ghost whip </i>are resolved as incorporeal touch attacks. The whip affects only creatures you attack with it, passing through objects and other creatures in its path and thereby allowing you to ignore cover between you and your target. When a <i>ghost whip </i>attack passes through total cover, the target is treated as having total concealment (50% miss chance). Against incorporeal and undead creatures, a <i>ghost whip </i>deals lethal damage and can be used to perform drag or reposition combat maneuvers (in addition to a whip's normal disarm and trip maneuvers). A <i>ghost whip </i>cannot be disarmed or sundered.</p><h1>Grave Words</h1><p><b>School </b>Necromancy [Language-Dependent]; <b>Level </b>Medium 0, Occultist 0, Psychic 0, Spiritualist 0</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 minute</p><p><b>Components </b>S</p><p><b>Range </b>touch</p><p><b>Target </b>one dead creature</p><p><b>Duration </b>1 round</p><p>With this spell and a touch, you can force a corpse talk to you, but you can't ask it specific questions or communicate with it at all. The corpse will start babbling for 1 round, spitting out random sentences. There is a 10% chance this information is of some use to the caster, but it is difficult to distinguish whether the information is useful (the GM makes the percentile roll in secret).</p><p>Useful information may include warnings about dangers deeper in a dungeon, the command word to a magic item, or even vague and spectral warnings of your or your companions' future. The GM decides what information, useful or not, the corpse spews out in its babbling.</p><p>Once a corpse has been subject to <i>grave words </i>by any caster, any new attempt to cast <i>grave words </i>on that corpse fails. You can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the head of the corpse must have a mouth in order to speak at all. This spell doesn't affect a corpse that has been turned into an undead creature.</p><h1>Hypercognition</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>School </b>Divination; <b>Level </b>Alchemist 3, Bard 3, Medium 2, Psychic 2, Sorcerer/Wizard 4</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>V</p><p><b>Range </b>personal</p><p><b>Target </b>you</p><p><b>Duration </b>see text</p><p>You rapidly catalog and collate all available data on a person, place, thing, or event, calling to mind scraps of memory and assembling clues in a logical and systematic order.

You can implant any information you wish that could be implanted by the <i>charge object </i>spell, as well as up to one piece of information per 3 levels that could be attained using psychometry or the <i>object reading </i>spell. You can detail this information in any way you see fit, either making up a previous owner and circumstances involving the object from whole cloth, or attempting to emulate the biographical information and fictional accounts of a specific individual's experience with the object.</p><p>During the spell's duration, creatures reading the object through the <i>object reading </i>spell or the psychometry occult skill unlock receive this false information in place of an item's true history if they fail a Will saving throw. Creatures that succeed at their saves still detect and receive the false information, but recognize it for what is and are able to discern the fictitious information from the item's true history without difficulty.</p><p>This spell masks its own magical aura, causing the target to not register as magical to <i>detect </i>spells and similar effects. This masking doesn't conceal any other magical auras on the object, and can be overcome in the same ways as <i>magic aura</i>.</p><h1>Incorporeal Chains</h1><p><b>School </b>Evocation [Force]; <b>Level </b>Psychic 6, Spiritualist 5</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S</p><p><b>Range </b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><b>Target </b>one incorporeal creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart</p><p><b>Duration </b>concentration</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p><p>You summon ghostly chains to bind incorporeal creatures.

Grappled opponents can't move without first breaking the grapple. The spell prohibits all other movement unless the creature breaks the grapple first (although dimensional magic and the like still work as normal). Each round you concentrate, the chains continue grappling their current targets (though they don't seek out targets they aren't currently grappling). The <i>incorporeal chains </i>receive a +5 bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks against opponents the chains are already grappling, but can't move foes or pin foes. Each round the <i>incorporeal chains </i>succeed at a grapple combat maneuver check, they deal an additional amount of damage equal to 1d8 + your key spellcasting ability score modifier. The CMD of <i>incorporeal chains</i>, for the purposes of escaping the grapple, is equal to 10 + its CMB. If you move out of range of any of the grappled creatures, the chains cease grappling those creatures.</p><h1>Inflict Pain</h1><p><b>School </b>Enchantment [Mind-Affecting, Pain(UM)]; <b>Level </b>Antipaladin 2, Inquisitor 2, Medium 2, Mesmerist 2, Occultist 2, Psychic 2, Sorcerer/Wizard 3, Spiritualist 2, Witch 3</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S</p><p><b>Range </b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><b>Target </b>one creature</p><p><b>Duration </b>1 round/level</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will partial; see text; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p><p>You telepathically wrack the target's mind and body with agonizing pain that imposes a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks.

Though psychic spellcasters wield tremendous power in such battles, other creatures can also wield mental might with surprising potency.</p><h1>INSTIGATING A PSYCHIC DUEL</h1><p>A psychic spellcaster creates a binary mindscape when a target fails its save against <i>instigate psychic duel </i>(see page 174). The caster's and target's minds are then merged in a psychic duel within that mindscape until either the spell's duration ends or the psychic duel reaches its conclusion. If the duel begins during combat, each of the dueling characters retains its initiative order and the psychic duel goes on in conjunction with the initial combat.</p><p>If the duel begins outside combat, the initiator can take a swift action to create a supernatural effect called a psychic manifestation (see below) upon entering the binary mindscape, before her opponent's first turn.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>While locked in a psychic duel, the combatants' physical bodies become unresponsive. They retain their positions, but they can take no actions and lose their Dexterity bonuses to Armor Class for the duration of the duel.</p><h1>RUNNING PSYCHIC DUELS</h1><p>Each combatant in a psychic duel attacks her opponent and defends herself with the power of her imagination and force of her personality. Such combatants appear in the binary mindscape much as they appear in reality (unless using a mental mask; see page 236), but their abilities and attacks are enhanced in some ways and limited in others by the strange laws of the binary mindscape.</p><p>While the illusion of physical movement exists in the mindscape's reality, such things as speed and position have little bearing on a psychic duel. Combatants are limited to purely mental actions, speech, and the creation of psychic manifestations (see below). With very few exceptions, spells and spell-like abilities can't be used (see Concluding a Psychic Duel on page 205).</p><p>When a character enters a binary mindscape, she uses the following statistics as they were prior to entering: her current hit points; ability scores; AC and touch AC; Reflex, Fortitude, and Will saving throws; highest melee attack bonus; and highest ranged attack bonus. These attack bonuses apply on melee and ranged offensive manifestations, respectively (see page 203). Regeneration and fast healing are the only special abilities that apply in a psychic duel; uncanny dodge and damage reduction, for example, do not.</p><p>Bonuses and penalties granted by items, as well as spells and effects active before entering the mindscape, apply to these statistics, as such items and effects gain psychic equivalents when a creature enters a mindscape. However, while the mind is engaged in a psychic duel, only damaging and healing spells and effects cast on the body of a combatant have an effect on the battle.</p><p>Manifestations retain many of the manifestor's combat capabilities. The nature of the binary mindscape translates martial prowess into psychic parallels; after all, such prowess comes from training, muscle memory, and other subconscious components of the mind. This means that while martially inclined characters have fewer resources in a psychic duel, they can still make powerful attacks against their foes with great accuracy.</p><p>Conditions gained during a psychic duel rarely carry over into the real world, but damage is dealt to the physical body of the duelist, so it's possible for combatants to die. Similarly, unlike all other effects that occur in the real world after a psychic duel begins, damaging and healing a duelist's physical body carry over to the psychic duel.</p><h1>PSYCHIC MANIFESTATIONS</h1><p>While engaged in a psychic duel, the combatants don't attack or cast spells normally. Instead, the combatants create psychic manifestations, abilities that can be used only within a binary mindscape; these represent changes to the mindscape's fabric (see Mindscapes on page 234).</p><h1>Generating Manifestation Points</h1><p>Psychic manifestations are fueled by psychic energy, represented by manifestation points (MP). Each combatant has a manifesting level equal either to its highest caster level or half its number of Hit Dice, whichever is higher. The maximum number of manifestation points a combatant can spend when creating a manifestation is equal either to the highest-level spell the combatant can cast or 1/4 its HD (minimum 1 and maximum 5), whichever is higher.</p><p>In order to create a psychic manifestation, a combatant must generate MP in any of four ways: from ability scores, from class features, by sacrificing spells, or by sacrificing spell-like abilities. She can use each of these methods only once per manifestation. For example, a character who is a gunslinger 1/wizard 8 could generate 1 MP from ability scores, 1 MP from grit, and 2 MP by sacrificing a 2nd-level spell, thus reaching her per-manifestation limit of 4 MP, but she couldn't do so by sacrificing four different 1st-level spells. If a combatant doesn't use all of the manifestation points it generates immediately, the extra points are lost.</p><p>Generating MP from ability scores doesn't deplete the ability score, but it has other consequences for a combatant once the duel is concluded (see below). All other sources of MP deplete the spent resources in the real world as well.</p><p><b>Generating MP from Ability Scores</b>: Every combatant begins a psychic duel with a pool of MP equal to the combatant's HD + the average of her Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. As a free action, a combatant can draw from this pool to generate MP. A combatant who draws any number of points from this pool is fatigued upon leaving the binary mindscape. A combatant who draws half or more of these points is exhausted upon leaving the mindscape, and takes a -4 penalty to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma for 24 hours thereafter. If a combatant expends the entire pool, she becomes unconscious after leaving the mindscape. The fatigued, exhausted, and unconscious conditions and the -4 penalty ignore all immunities and last for 24 hours; they can't be removed before that time except by a <i>wish </i>or a <i>miracle</i>.</p><p><b>Generating MP from Select Class Features</b>: As a free action, a combatant with an arcane, grit, ki, panache, or phrenic pool (or any other similar class feature the GM chooses) can spend points from these pools to generate MP at a rate of 1 MP per point spent.</p><p><b>Sacrificing Spells to Generate MP</b>: As a free action, a combatant can sacrifice a single spell slot (if he's a spontaneous caster) or prepared spell (if he's a prepared caster) to generate a number of MP equal to the level of the spell slot or prepared spell sacrificed. Alchemists and investigators can sacrifice an extract slot as if it were a spell slot, but only if that extract slot is currently open and not already invested in a physical extract.</p><p><b>Sacrificing Spell-Like Abilities to Generate MP</b>: A combatant can sacrifice a use of a spell-like ability in a way similar to sacrificing spells to generate MP. However, each at-will spell-like ability can be sacrificed only once during a single psychic duel; it is not a source of infinite MP.</p><h1>Creating Psychic Manifestations</h1><p>Psychic manifestations have three main types: offensive manifestations, defensive manifestations, and thought-form creatures. For the purpose of concentration checks, creating a manifestation is considered casting a spell with a spell level equal to the number of MP spent to create the manifestation. The combatant creating the manifestation treats her manifesting level as her caster level for such checks.</p><h1>Offensive Manifestation (Full-Round Action)</h1><p>This type of manifestation is a direct attack on an opponent, a thought-form creature, or both. An offensive manifestation can attack a variety of defenses, depending on the number of MP spent and the desires of its creator. Creating an offensive manifestation requires three steps.</p><p><b>Step 1-Create Sensory Effects</b>: Combatants creating psychic manifestations are limited only by their imaginations as to the look, sound, feel, and smell of each manifestation; these sensory effects guide combatants in their later choices. For example, if a combatant envisions an offensive manifestation as a giant ball of lava he throws at his opponent, that might suggest that the attack should force a Reflex saving throw rather than targeting the opponent's AC. Regardless of the effect's form, damage dealt by a manifestation is always untyped damage, and can be mitigated only by defensive manifestations.</p><p><b>Step 2-Determine Attack Type</b>: By default, an offensive manifestation acts as either a melee or ranged attack (creator's choice) that resolves against a single target's AC. The creator can have the manifestation resolve against touch AC instead by increasing the cost by 2 MP.</p><p>Alternatively, the creator can instead force both his opponent and any thought-form creature it controls to attempt a saving throw to avoid the effect; this increases the cost by 1 MP. The DC is equal to 10 + the total number of MP spent + the Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma bonus of the creator (whichever is highest). The creator chooses which kind of saving throw-Fortitude, Reflex, or Will-the target must attempt. By default, a successful save negates the manifestation's damage, but the creator can increase the cost by an additional 1 MP to cause the manifestation to deal half damage on a successful save.</p><p>If an offensive manifestation's effects can be negated or reduced with a saving throw, the creator can increase the cost to have the manifestation apply a condition (see Step 3).</p><p><b>Step 3-Determine Damage and Conditions</b>: After determining the manifestation's attack type, the creator determines its number of damage dice. The creator must spend at least 1 MP on damage, which grants the manifestation 1 damage die, but she can spend more to increase the number of dice, as shown on the table below.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>MP Spent on Damage</b></td><td><b>Number of Damage Dice</b></td></tr><tr><td>1 MP</td><td>1 die</td></tr><tr><td>2 MP</td><td>4 dice</td></tr><tr><td>3 MP</td><td>6 dice</td></tr><tr><td>4 MP</td><td>8 dice</td></tr><tr><td>5 MP</td><td>10 dice</td></tr><tr><td>6 MP</td><td>12 dice</td></tr><tr><td>7 MP</td><td>14 dice</td></tr><tr><td>8 MP</td><td>16 dice</td></tr><tr><td>9 MP</td><td>1 die per creator's manifesting level (maximum 20 dice)</td></tr></table></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>The manifestation's damage die type depends on the source of the manifestation's MP. Psychic spells and spell-like abilities sacrificed grant d8s. Arcane spells and other spell-like abilities grant d6s. All other methods of generating MP (including mixed methods) grant d4s. If the manifestation's attack resolves against AC or touch AC, a natural 20 on the attack roll threatens a critical hit for double damage.</p><p>If the manifestation allows a saving throw, the creator can spend additional MP to add one condition from the list below (she must still spend at least 1 MP on damage). A successful saving throw always negates the condition. Conditions gained in a psychic duel end if the duel ends before the condition's normal duration expires. The conditions below otherwise follow the normal rules for those conditions, with the following exceptions and additions.</p><p><i>Blinded (3 MP)</i>: Affected creatures are blinded for 1 round; they can't use offensive manifestations that require saves.</p><p><i>Confused (3 MP)</i>: The affected creatures are confused for 1 round, breaking concentration automatically. If an affected creature is forced to attack the nearest creature, it attacks its opponent's thought-form creature if one exists, or the opponent if not. A confused combatant never attacks her own thought-form creature, or vice versa. This condition can be applied only to manifestations that require Will saves.</p><p><i>Dazed (4 MP)</i>: The affected creatures are dazed for 1 round. A dazed combatant can continue to concentrate on thought-form creatures and create defensive manifestations, but can't create thought-form creatures or offensive manifestations. This condition can be applied only to manifestations that require Will saves.</p><p><i>Entangled (2 MP)</i>: The affected creatures are entangled until they take a full-round action to end this condition. This condition can be applied only to manifestations that require Reflex saves.</p><p><i>Nauseated (4 MP)</i>: The affected creatures are nauseated for 1 round. A nauseated creature can create only defensive manifestations. This condition can be applied only to manifestations that require Fortitude saves.</p><p><i>Shaken (1 MP)</i>: The affected creatures are shaken for 1d4 rounds. This condition can be applied only to manifestations that require Will saves.</p><h1>Defensive Manifestation (Action Type Varies)</h1><p>Defensive manifestations protect a combatant from her opponent's manifestations. A combatant in a psychic duel can manifest the following defensive abilities.</p><p><i>Evasive Mind (1 or more MP; swift action)</i>: The combatant gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws and gains evasion for a number of rounds equal to the number of MP she spent to create this manifestation.</p><p><i>Hardened Mind (1 to 4 MP; swift action)</i>: For 1 round, the combatant's Armor Class increases by an amount equal to the number of MP she spent to create this manifestation, and her touch AC increases by half that (minimum +0).</p><p><i>Thought Barrier (1 or more MP; swift action)</i>: A thought barrier reduces the damage dealt to the combatant by offensive manifestations and thought-form creatures by 5 points. This manifestation lasts for a number of rounds equal to the number of MP the combatant spent to create it.</p><p><i>Disruptive Counter (variable MP; immediate action)</i>: When the combatant's opponent creates a manifestation, the combatant can spend a number of MP equal to that manifestation's cost + 2 to counter that manifestation. When she does, any currently active thought-form creatures or defensive manifestations she has are dismissed.</p><p><i>Nimble Mind (2 MP; immediate action)</i>: When the combatant is attacked with an offensive manifestation that targets her touch AC, this ability changes it to target her full AC.</p><p><i>Psychic Redirect (1 MP; immediate action)</i>: When the combatant would take damage while she has a thought-form creature active, she can use this ability to apply the damage to her thought-form creature instead. If the attack targets both the combatant and the thought-form creature, the thought-form creature takes the damage for both itself and the combatant and suffers any condition conferred by the attack, but the combatant suffers no effects.</p><h1>Thought-Form Creature (1-Round Action)</h1><p>A thought-form creature is a mentally constructed thrall that takes any form its creator desires. Creating a thought-form creature takes 1 full round (as if the creator were casting a spell with a 1-round casting time) and lasts as long as its creator concentrates on the creature's existence as a full-round action; a combatant can manifest only one thought-form creature at a time. A thought-form creature must make its attacks against another thought-form creature if one is manifested; if not, it can attack its creator's opponent. The creature makes its attacks when its creator uses a full-round action to concentrate on the thought-form creature. When a thought-from creature is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it disappears and its creator takes an amount of damage equal to the thought-form creature's psychic backlash (see Thought-Form Creature Statistics below). A thought-form creature can be dismissed as a free action.</p><p>A basic thought-form creature costs 1 MP to create, and has the following base statistics.</p><p><b>Thought-Form Creature Statistics</b>: <b>AC </b>creator's AC; <b>touch AC </b>creator's touch AC; <b>hp </b>1/2 creator's current hit points; <b>Attack Bonus </b>creator's manifesting level + creator's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest); <b>Damage </b>1d6 + creator's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest); <b>Saves </b>creator's save bonuses; <b>Psychic Backlash </b>1d10 + the MP cost of the thought-form creature.</p><p><b>Thought-Form Creature Augmentations</b>: When creating a thought-form creature, the creator can apply any of the following augmentations, up to her maximum MP limit.</p><p><i>Increase Attack Bonus</i>: Increase the cost by up to 4 MP to increase the thought-form creature's attack bonus on all its attacks by the same amount.</p><p><i>Extra Attacks</i>: Increase the cost by 2 MP to grant the thought-form creature a second attack each round. Increasing the cost by an additional 2 MP grants it a third attack, but the creature makes the third attack at a -5 penalty.</p><p><i>Increase Armor Class</i>: Increase the cost by up to 4 MP to increase the thought-form creature's AC by the same amount and its touch AC by half that amount.</p><p><i>Increase Saving Throws</i>: Increase the cost by 2 or 4 MP to increase the bonus on all of the thought-form creature's saving throws by half that amount.</p><p><i>Increase Hit Points</i>: Increase the cost by up to 4 MP to increase the thought-form creature's hit points by 10 x that amount.</p><p><i>Increase Damage</i>: Increase the cost by 1 MP to increase the thought-form creature's damage die type for all its attacks to d8, or by 2 MP to increase the damage die type to d10. If the thought-form creature has only one attack, its damage bonus with that attack increases to 1-1/2 x the creator's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma bonus (whichever is highest).</p><p><i>Protective Ability</i>: Increase the cost by 1 MP to grant the creator a +4 bonus to AC (both normal and touch), a +2 bonus on Reflex saving throws, and evasion for as long as this thought-form creature exists. Increasing the cost by an additional 2 MP also grants the creator immunity to attacks against AC or touch AC for as long as this thought-form creature exists.</p><h1>CONCLUDING A PSYCHIC DUEL</h1><p>There are a number of ways a psychic duel can conclude and the combatants' minds can return to their bodies (aside from the end of the <i>instigate psychic duel </i>spell that started the combat). The duel ends immediately if one of the combatants reaches 0 or fewer hit points or both combatants agree to end the psychic duel. Each combatant can make this agreement as a free action that can be taken even when it isn't that combatant's turn. Rarely, a spell or ability can allow combatants to leave a psychic duel. For instance, unlike most spells, <i>mindscape door </i>can be cast while in a psychic duel, allowing the caster to leave the mindscape and end the duel. Lastly, a creature adjacent to the body of a combatant can attempt to shake that creature out of its torpor as a standard action. Doing so is a melee touch attack that deals no damage but allows the combatant to attempt a new saving throw against the effect that started the psychic duel. If the check is successful, the mind of the roused creature returns to its body and the duel ends. A creature in a psychic duel can attempt no more than one additional save per round in this way.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter5occultrules\">^Occult Rules</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter6runninganoccultgame\">Running an Occult Game</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"fsHDy627g7l4eXEN"}

Within that basic concept exists the potential for innumerable variations. Some of these are too close to existing classes to warrant being full base classes of their own, yet prove compelling enough to become archetypes- sets of alternate class features that can be easily swapped for those of a given class to help customize the class's focus. This chapter presents new archetypes or other options for all of the new classes introduced in this book, as well as for numerous base classes from other sources. Feats and spells in this section denoted with an asterisk (*) appear in Chapters 3 and 4 of this book, respectively.</p><h1>ARCHETYPES</h1><p>Each alternate class feature presented in an archetype either replaces or alters one or more specific class features from the base class.</p><p>When an archetype includes multiple alternate class features, a character must take all of them-often blocking the character from ever gaining certain standard class features, but replacing them with other options. All class features of the base class that aren't mentioned among the alternate class features of an archetype remain unchanged and are acquired normally when a character reaches the appropriate level. If an alternate class feature replaces a base class feature, the archetype doesn't count as having that base class feature for the purpose of meeting any requirements or prerequisites. On the other hand, if an alternate class feature alters an existing class feature, it is considered to be the core class feature for the purposes of meeting any requirements or prerequisites, even if it was renamed.</p><p>A character can take more than one archetype, but none of the alternate class features can replace or alter the same class feature of the base class.</p><p>If a class feature has a series of improvements (such as a fighter's weapon training or a ranger's favored enemy), it can be replaced either entirely or partially. By default, an alternate class feature replaces the entire original class feature and all of its improvements. For example, if a class feature states that it replaces trap sense without mentioning a specific bonus, it replaces trap sense entirely.</p><p>If an alternate class feature replaces one instance of a class feature that's part of a series, the next time the character would gain an improvement to that ability, the new improvement counts as the lower-level ability that was replaced by the archetype, and all subsequent improvements follow suit. For example, if the barbarian's 3rd-level trap sense +1 were replaced, the barbarian would gain trap sense +1 at 6th level, trap sense +2 at 9th level, and so on.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypes\">^Archetypes</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"ghZA3ogTt3HBi1xS"}

A phantom's base attack bonus is equal to its Hit Dice. Phantoms do not gain additional attacks using their natural weapons at higher base attack bonuses.</p><p><b>Good/Bad Saves</b>: These are the phantom's base saving throw bonuses. A phantom possesses two good saving throws and one bad saving throw, determined by the phantom's emotional focus (see page 80).</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Skills</b>: This lists the phantom's total skill ranks. A phantom can assign skill ranks to any skills, but it must possess the appropriate appendage to use some skills. Phantoms with Intelligence scores above the base value modify these totals as normal (a phantom gains a number of skill ranks equal to 2 + its Intelligence modifier per Hit Die). A phantom can't have more ranks in a skill than it has Hit Dice. Phantom skill ranks are set once chosen.</p><p><b>Feats</b>: This is the total number of feats possessed by a phantom. A phantom can select any feat it qualifies for, but it must possess the appropriate appendage in order to use some feats. Phantom feats are set once chosen.</p><p><b>Armor Bonus</b>: The number noted here is the increase to the phantom's natural armor bonus when it manifests as an ectoplasmic creature, and its deflection bonus when it manifests as an incorporeal creature. An ectoplasmic or incorporeal manifested phantom can't wear armor of any kind, as the armor interferes with the spiritualist's connection with the phantom; a phantom may seem to be wearing armor, but this appearance is just an illusory part of its appearance.</p><p><b>Dex/Cha Bonus</b>: Add this bonus to the phantom's Dexterity and Charisma scores.</p><p><b>Slam Damage</b>: Phantoms have two slam natural weapon attacks. Those attacks' damage is based on the size of the phantom and is sometimes modified by the abilities of the phantom's emotional focus. Table 1-11 gives the damage by spiritualist level of the slam attacks made by a Medium phantom. See Table 1-12 for the damage of such attacks for Small and Large phantoms. Often, an individual phantom manifests in a form that makes it appear as if it had weapons or other natural attacks. Regardless of their apparent forms, the phantom's attacks still deal the slam attack damage listed on Table 1-11 or Table 1-12.</p><p><b>Special</b>: This column includes a number of abilities gained by all phantoms as they increase in power. Each of these bonuses is described below.</p><p><i>Darkvision (Ex)</i>: The phantom has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.</p><p><i>Link (Su)</i>: A spiritualist and her phantom share a mental link that allows for communication across distances (as long as they are on the same plane). This communication is a free action that can be performed even when it isn't the spiritualist's turn, but the spiritualist and the phantom must both be conscious to communicate in this way. This allows the spiritualist to give orders to her phantom at any time. Magic items interfere with a spiritualist's connection to her phantom; as a result, the spiritualist and her phantom share magic item slots. For example, if the spiritualist is wearing a magic ring, her phantom can wear only one magic ring. In the case of a conflict, the items worn by the spiritualist remain active, and those worn by the phantom become dormant. The phantom must possess the appropriate appendages to utilize a magic item.</p><p><i>Share Spells (Su)</i>: The spiritualist can cast a spell with a target of \"you\" on her phantom (as a spell with a range of touch) instead of on herself. A spiritualist can cast spells from the spiritualist spell list on her phantom even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the phantom's type (outsider). This ability does not allow the phantom to share abilities that aren't spells, even if they function like spells.</p><p><i>Deliver Touch Spells (Su)</i>: The phantom can deliver touch spells for the spiritualist when fully manifested in incorporeal or ectoplasmic form. The spiritualist and the phantom need not be in contact to accomplish this, but the phantom must be within 30 feet and the spiritualist must be able to see the phantom. If the spiritualist is 12th level or higher, the phantom can deliver touch spells within 50 feet of the spiritualist. The spiritualist can cast the spell, and then the phantom can deliver the touch as an immediate action. If the touch spell deals damage, the phantom must make the attack roll. The phantom can't hold the charge of a touch spell cast by the spiritualist using this ability. If the spell is delivered to the phantom, it must touch a target or the spell is lost. If the spell allows you to touch up to six willing targets, the phantom can accomplish this with an immediate action, but all of the willing targets must be within the phantom's melee reach at the time.</p><p><i>Magic Attacks (Su)</i>: When the phantom manifests in ectoplasmic form, it treats its slam attacks as if they were magic for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. If the spiritualist is 10th level or higher, all of the phantom's weapons are treated as the alignment of the phantom for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><i>Ability Score Increase (Ex)</i>: The phantom adds 1 to one of its ability scores.</p><p><i>Devotion (Ex)</i>: The phantom gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects.</p><p><i>Incorporeal Flight (Su)</i>: When the phantom manifests in incorporeal form, it has a fly speed of 40 feet (good).</p><h1>Phantom Statistics</h1><p>A spiritualist's phantom is typically the same size as the spiritualist. A spiritualist can have a phantom that is one size category smaller than her, and if she is Small or smaller, she can have a phantom one size category larger than her. A phantom is always a humanoid-shaped creature, and looks somewhat like it did in its past life while manifested, though the emotional turmoil of its existence usually warps its appearance in some way.</p><p>Every phantom has the following base statistics, which are then modified by its size and emotional focus.</p><h1>Phantom</h1><p><b>Starting Statistics</b>: <b>Type </b>Outsider (phantom); <b>Size </b>As spiritualist or one size category smaller (or one size category larger, if the spiritualist is Small or smaller); <b>Speed </b>30 ft.; <b>AC </b>+2 dodge (in incorporeal form) or +2 natural armor (in ectoplasmic form); <b>Attack </b>2 slams (1d6 or 1d4 if size Small); <b>Ability Scores </b>Str 12, Dex 14, Con 13, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 13.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Phantom Skills</h1><p>The following skills are class skills for the phantom: Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Perception (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Stealth (Dex). In addition, at 1st level, the spiritualist can choose one additional skill as a class skill for her phantom. The phantom also gains two class skills based on its emotional focus. The phantom automatically gains bonus ranks in these two skills as the spiritualist increases in level-its number of ranks in these skills is always equal to its number of Hit Dice.</p><h1>Full Manifestation Forms</h1><p>Each time she fully manifests her phantom, the spiritualist must choose whether to manifest the phantom in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>The phantom gains the statistics presented on Table 1-11: Manifested Phantom's Base Statistics, modified by the phantom's emotional focus and by the type of manifestation the spiritualist chooses.</p><p><b>Ectoplasmic</b>: When the spiritualist manifests her phantom in ectoplasmic form, the phantom gains the following abilities.</p><p><i>Damage Reduction</i>: A phantom manifested in ectoplasmic form has DR 5/slashing. When the spiritualist reaches 5th level, the phantom gains DR 5/magic. At 10th level, the damage resistance increases to 10/magic. At 15th level, it increases to 15/magic, and at 20th level, the damage reduction becomes DR 15/-.</p><p><i>Phase Lurch (Su): </i>A phantom in ectoplasmic form has the ability to pass through walls or material obstacles. In order to use this ability, it must begin and end its turn outside whatever wall or obstacle it's moving through. An ectoplasmic phantom can't move through corporeal creatures with this ability, and its movement speed is halved while moving through a wall or obstacle. Any surface it moves through is coated with a thin, silvery mucus that lingers for 1 minute.</p><p><b>Incorporeal</b>: When the spiritualist chooses to manifest the phantom in incorporeal form, the phantom appears within 30 feet of the spiritualist as a ghostly apparition. It gains the incorporeal subtype (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>301), including a deflection bonus to AC equal to its Charisma modifier. Since it isn't an undead creature, it takes no damage from holy water or positive energy. Unlike other incorporeal creatures, an incorporeal phantom can't attack corporeal creatures, except to deliver touch-attack spells using the deliver touch spell ability. An incorporeal manifested phantom can make slam attacks against other incorporeal creatures as if it were in ectoplasmic form.</p><h1>Emotional Focus</h1><p>Each phantom has an emotional focus-a powerful emotion based on some experience in life that keeps it tethered to the Material and Ethereal planes. This emotional focus also grants the phantom abilities that it can use while manifested. The type of each ability and its power are determined by the spiritualist's level.</p><p>The emotional focus determines which bonus skill ranks the phantom gains, as well as the skills in which its spiritualist master gains Skill Focus. It also determines the good saving throws of the manifested phantom and the special abilities the phantom gains as it increases in level.</p><p>While phantoms tend to appear much as they did in life-at least as they did at the time of death-each emotional focus twists a phantom's visage, mannerisms, and even personality in its own way. Unlike with most creatures, a phantom's emotion aura often manifests for all to see, even those without the benefit of spells or abilities. Often phantoms manifest these emotion auras in unique ways, some of which are described in individual emotional focus descriptions.</p><h1>Anger</h1><p>Phantoms with this emotional focus are filled with seething anger from events in their past lives. Phantoms with this focus often take the form of hulking brutes with furrowed brows or of frenzied creatures that always seem ready to strike down those who come too near. Many times, these phantoms exude a bright red aura, especially when they are engaged in combat, or they seem to breathe a red mist in shallow pants from behind clenched, phantasmal teeth.</p><p><b>Skills</b>: The phantom gains a number of ranks in Intimidate and Survival equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist's consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.</p><p><b>Good Saves</b>: Fortitude and Will.</p><p><b>Strength Focus</b>: The phantom gains a +2 bonus to Strength and a -2 penalty to Dexterity. Instead of the phantom gaining a bonus to Dexterity as the spiritualist gains levels, an anger-focused phantom gains a bonus to Strength instead.</p><p><b>Powerful Strike (Ex)</b>: A phantom with this focus deals more damage with its slam attacks. It deals slam damage as a creature one size category larger than its current size. The phantom also gains Power Attack as a bonus feat.</p><p><b>Aura of Fury (Su)</b>: When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, as a swift action, the phantom can emit a 20-foot-radius aura of fury. Creatures within the aura gain a +2 bonus on melee attack rolls but take a -2 penalty to AC. Ending the aura is a free action. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.</p><p><b>Ferocious Mien (Su)</b>: When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, once per day as a swift action, a phantom in ectoplasmic form can grow more ferocious and frightening. It becomes one size category larger than its current size, as affected by an <i>enlarge person </i>spell, and grows fiercer in combat, as if affected by a <i>rage </i>spell. This effect lasts for 1 round per class level of the spiritualist. When the spiritualist reaches 18th level, a phantom using ferocious mien also gains the frightful presence extraordinary ability (<i>Bestiary </i>300; range 30 feet, duration 5d6 rounds).</p><p><b>Furious Wail (Su)</b>: When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, once per day as a standard action, the phantom can emit a single angry wail that acts as <i>wail of the banshee</i>. The phantom uses its Hit Dice as its caster level for the effect, and the DC of the effect is 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.</p><h1>Dedication</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Either through a sense of love or the desire to finish some unfinished task, a phantom with this emotional focus has an undying devotion to something or someone in the world. It's often the case that a phantom with</p><p>this emotional focus has a strong familial tie with its spiritualist master. A dedication phantom most often appears as a strong and stern protector with a watchful gaze, and its service to its spiritualist is unwavering. These spirits exude auras of blue, or sometimes rose if their love for their spiritualist masters in life was great. Many times these auras manifest as a halo, giving these phantoms a divine appearance, no matter their actual alignment or opinions on matters of religion.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Skill</b>: The phantom gains a number of ranks in Diplomacy and Sense Motive equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist's consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.</p><p><b>Good Saves</b>: Reflex and Will.</p><p><b>Iron Will</b>: The phantom gains Iron Will as a bonus feat. Furthermore, when the phantom is within its master's consciousness, it grants the benefits of Iron Will to its master if its master doesn't have that feat.</p><p><b>Dutiful Strike (Su)</b>: When a creature makes an attack against the phantom's master, the phantom gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls against that target, and deals damage against that target as if the phantom were one size category larger. For the purposes of this ability, an attack includes any harmful spell targeting the spiritualist master of whose area or effect includes the spiritualist master. Dutiful strike lasts for 1 minute, until another creature attacks the phantom's spiritualist master (at which point this effect transfers to the new attacker), or until the attacking creature is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, whichever occurs first.</p><p><b>Defending Aura (Su)</b>: When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, the phantom can emit a 10-foot-radius aura that grants protection to nearby allies. It can activate this aura at will as a swift action. Allies within the aura gain a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 bonus to CMD and on all saving throws. Deactivating the aura is a free action.</p><p><b>Devoted Servant (Su)</b>: When the spiritualist reaches 12th level and is caught unawares by an attack (such as an attack made in a surprise round or while the spiritualist is asleep or an attack by a creature using Stealth), if the phantom is not fully manifested, it automatically fully manifests from the spiritualist's consciousness to protect its master. The phantom stays manifested as long as the spiritualist is unaware and in danger. This ability requires no action from the spiritualist.</p><p><b>Steadfast Devotion (Su)</b>: When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, the phantom becomes immune to detrimental mind-affecting effects and all forms of possession, such as <i>magic jar </i>and <i>possession </i>(see page 181). Furthermore, the phantom is immune to <i>banishment</i>, <i>dismissal</i>, and similar effects.</p><h1>Despair</h1><p>Some creatures die in such horrific ways, or live such pointless and senseless lives, that despair grips their very beings. Phantoms with this focus use misery as a weapon, inflicting the living with the gloom of the phantoms' continued existence. Despair phantoms often appear twisted or wounded, showing the grisly circumstances of their demise. Their coloration tends to have a grayish or sickly green cast. When they speak, they do so in terrifying whispers or high-pitched screeches.</p><p><b>Skills</b>: The phantom gains a number of ranks in Intimidate and Stealth equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist's consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.</p><p><b>Good Saves</b>: Fortitude and Will.</p><p><b>Power from Despair</b>: The phantom gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls against creatures that are shaken, frightened, panicked, cowering, or subject to effects such as aura of despair or <i>crushing despair</i>.</p><p><b>Miserable Strike (Su)</b>: If the phantom hits a creature with a slam attack, that creature must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier) or take a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear and emotion(UM) effect. Penalties from multiple hits don't stack with themselves.</p><p><b>Aura of Despair (Su)</b>: When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, as a swift action, the phantom can emit a 10-foot aura of despair. Enemies within the aura take a -2 penalty on all saving throws. This is a fear effect. Deactivating the aura is a free action.</p><p><b>Despairing Shout (Su)</b>: When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, three times per day as a standard action, the phantom can emit a shout that acts as <i>crushing despair</i>. The phantom uses its Hit Dice as its caster level for the effect, and the DC of the effect equals 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.</p><p><b>Inescapable Despair (Su)</b>: When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, if the phantom hits with its slam attack, the creature hit doesn't get a save to resist the effects of miserable strike.</p><h1>Fear</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>A phantom with this emotional focus suffered from overwhelming fear in life. As a phantom, it is able to channel that fear into a terrifying weapon. Fear phantoms are often horrifying to behold. Sometimes they appear as ghostly figures in tattered funeral garb or wrapped in chains or other bindings. Their features may be distorted into gaunt and haunting forms, making them seem more like ghosts or spectres. A miasma of livid gray swirling motes often surrounds their forms as they stalk their surroundings, seeking to bestow their terror on others.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Skills</b>: The phantom gains a number of ranks in Intimidate and Stealth equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist's consciousness, such a phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.</p><p><b>Good Saves</b>: Reflex and Will.</p><p><b>Stealthy</b>: The phantom gains Stealthy as a bonus feat.</p><p><b>Horrifying Strike (Ex)</b>: If the phantom hits a creature with a slam attack, that creature must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier) or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. Multiple attacks against the same creature do not cause the creature to become frightened. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p><p><b>Increase Fear (Su)</b>: When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, as a swift action, the phantom can emit a 20-foot-radius aura that amplifies the fear conditions of enemies within it if they fail their Will saving throws (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier). A shaken enemy in the aura becomes frightened, a frightened creature becomes panicked, and a panicked creature cowers. This effect lasts either as long as the enemy stays within the aura and is under the condition of the initial fear effect, or for a number of rounds after it leaves the aura equal to 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice, or until the end of the original fear effect's duration, whichever comes first. A creature that succeeds at the saving throw is immune to this effect from the same phantom for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.</p><p><b>Frightful Attack (Su)</b>: When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, if the phantom hits with a slam attack, it can frighten those it hits instead of causing them to be shaken (the phantom chooses when it makes the attack). This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p><p><b>Shelter Allies (Su)</b>: When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, the phantom protects its allies from terror. Allies within the phantom's increase fear aura are immune to fear as long as they are within the aura. This ability also grants the phantom's spiritualist master immunity to fear as long as the phantom is not banished to the Ethereal Plane.</p><h1>Hatred</h1><p>Few things draw a spirit toward the Negative Material Plane like the emotion of hatred. Phantoms with this focus often are blinded by-and blind others with-this powerful emotion. These phantoms are frequently darker and more foreboding than all but those phantoms with the fear emotional focus. Many of them manifest as dark and dreadful knights, their armor bristling with spikes and their hands seeming to grasp barbed and terrible weapons. Other times they appear as tall, gaunt figures staring down arrogantly at those who approach. These phantoms typically spew a string of curses at their foes, often profane, sometimes poetic. Their auras are pulsating and pitch black, and thrum violently when these horrible phantoms attack.</p><p><b>Skills</b>: The phantom gains a number of ranks in Acrobatics and Perception equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist's consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.</p><p><b>Good Saves</b>: Fortitude and Reflex.</p><p><b>Weapon Finesse</b>: The phantom gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat.</p><p><b>Hated Target (Su)</b>: The phantom can take a move action to designate one creature within its line of sight as a hated target. The phantom gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls against its hated target, and a bonus on damage rolls equal to 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice (minimum 1). The phantom is so focused on this hated target that it takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls against all other creatures. The phantom can maintain these bonuses against only one target at a time, and these bonuses remain in effect until either the hated opponent is dead or it has been out of the phantom's line of sight for at least 1 minute. When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, the phantom can use this ability as a swift action, and takes no penalty when attacking creatures that are not designated as its hated enemy. The phantom must be manifested in ectoplasmic form to use this ability (unless the spiritualist is 17th level or higher; see Shared Hatred below).</p><p><b>Hateful Aura (Su)</b>: When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, as a swift action, the phantom can emit a 10-foot-radius aura that inflicts pain upon the minds of those who dare damage it or its master. Enemies within the aura that deal damage to the spiritualist or the phantom take an amount of damage equal to the phantom's Charisma bonus. This is a mind-affecting pain effect. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.</p><p><b>Sneak Attack (Su)</b>: When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, the phantom gains sneak attack +3d6, but only against its hated enemy. At 18th level, the sneak attack damage increases to +5d6.</p><p><b>Shared Hatred (Su)</b>: When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, the phantom can grant its hatred to others. When the phantom designates a hated enemy, its allies also gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls and a +4 bonus on damage rolls against that enemy. Furthermore, the phantom can use its hated target ability even when in incorporeal form; when it does, it can make slam attacks against a corporeal creature, but only if that corporeal creature is its hated target.</p><h1>Jealousy</h1><p>A phantom with this emotional focus is covetous of everything-its master, those who wish to do it harm, and any who do not pay attention to it. It demands to be the center of attention at all times. The forms these phantoms take are as diverse as the forms of jealousy in life. Often they take pleasing forms, wishing to draw others in. Other times they take the form of crawling and lurching things, grasping at all they covet when they come within reach. The auras of these needy phantoms quickly change in color, going from an oily green to orange, to brownish red as they swirl through emotions in their efforts to gain the objects of their dark desires.</p><p><b>Skills</b>: The phantom gains a number of ranks in Appraise and Bluff equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist's consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.</p><p><b>Good Saves</b>: Reflex and Will.</p><p><b>Deceitful</b>: The phantom gains Deceitful as a bonus feat.</p><p><b>Jealous Combatant (Su)</b>: Each time the phantom hits a creature with a melee attack, for 1 round that creature takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls made against anyone other than the phantom. This effect does not stack with itself.</p><p><b>Resentful Aura (Su)</b>: When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, as a swift action, the phantom can emit a 20-foot-radius aura that forces enemies within the aura who make an attack or cast a spell that does not include the phantom in its effect to succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier) or become staggered until the end of the enemy's next turn. Ending the aura is a free action. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.</p><p><b>Retribution (Su)</b>: When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, each time a creature attacks the phantom's master, whether that attack hits or misses, it enrages the phantom. Until the end of the phantom's next turn, any attack the phantom makes that hits the creature that has attacked her deals 2d8 extra points of damage. This extra damage is precision damage.</p><p><b>Mine to Take (Su)</b>: When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, once per day as an immediate action, just before the phantom's master is about to attempt a saving throw or be targeted by an attack roll, the phantom and the spiritualist can swap places as long as both are on the same plane and the phantom is aware of the attack or effect. After the swap occurs, the phantom is targeted by the attack or effect that triggered this ability, though the phantom may be immune or resistant to the effect. This is a teleportation effect. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.</p><h1>Zeal</h1><p>A phantom with this emotional focus fixates on every task given as if it were the phantom's last. The most basic commands are treated as life-and-death situations, and the truly dangerous ones are faced with a resolve and tenacity that sometimes defies common sense. Zeal phantoms take the form of steadfast protectors or daring and manic creatures looking for the next challenge or opportunity to prove itself to either its master or itself. Often very prideful creatures, these phantoms display an orange aura upon completing their tasks. They are prone to boast about their accomplishments and chastise those around them for not accomplishing more.</p><p><b>Skills</b>: The phantom gains a number of ranks in Acrobatics and Survival equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist's consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.</p><p><b>Good Saves</b>: Fortitude and Reflex.</p><p><b>Tracking</b>: The phantom adds half its number of Hit Dice (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks to follow tracks.</p><p><b>Ruthless Combatant (Su)</b>: The phantom threatens a critical hit with its slam attacks on a roll of 19-20. When the spiritualist reaches 11th level, the phantom's critical modifier with slam attacks increases to x3. This doesn't stack with Improved Critical or similar effects.</p><p><b>Determination Aura (Su)</b>: When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, as a swift action, the phantom can emit a 20-foot-radius aura that grants its zeal to nearby allies. Allies within the aura gain a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls and saving throws. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.</p><p><b>Steadfast Servant (Su)</b>: When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, the phantom can stay manifested even when its spiritualist master is unconscious or asleep.</p><p><b>Zeal's Resolve (Su)</b>: When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, three times per day as a free action, when the phantom misses with an attack roll or fails a saving throw, it can reroll the failed attack or saving throw. It must take the new result, even if that result is worse.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1occultclasses\">^Occult Classes</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypes\">Archetypes</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"lMz2UAjglGWFeNWX"}
{"name":"Occultist (ARCHETYPE)","permission":{"default":0,"JgpLZkPryhl1EFab":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_2339b90hqze","path":"Pathfinder RPG - Occult Adventures Reference Library#/CF_SEP/Occult Adventures#/CF_SEP/CHAPTER 2: ARCHETYPES","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\"></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Though most occultists tap into the latent power within a wide variety of mundane implements, certain occultists draw upon stranger sources still.</p><h1>BATTLE HOST (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Well versed in military history, battlefield lore, and the occult, a battle host forms a supernatural bond with a chosen weapon, suit of armor, or shield, from which he can channel psychic energy to cast spells, conjure the spirit of the object's former owner, increase his own physical might, and produce a number of other remarkable abilities.</p><p><b>Class Skills</b>: A battle host adds Knowledge (local) (Int) and Knowledge (nobility) (Int) as class skills. This alters the occultist's class skills.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: A battle host is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all types of armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields). This replaces the occultist's weapon and armor proficiency.</p><p><b>Panoply Bond (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a battle host forms a supernatural bond with a specific weapon, suit of armor, or shield. This selection is permanent and can never be changed. The bonded item is masterwork quality and the battle host begins play with it at no cost. The bonded item is immune to the broken condition for as long as the battle host lives. If a battle host dies and is restored to life, the bonded item is also restored if it was destroyed. Any magic powers associated with a battle host's bonded item function only for the battle host; in the hands of anyone else it is only a masterwork item. The bonded item starts as an implement for any single school of magic at 1st level, and gains access to additional schools of magic at 2nd, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels, granting the battle host access to base focus powers and resonant powers accordingly. The battle host's bonded item serves as his implement component to cast occultist spells of all the schools that he knows. However, he must split his mental focus among the schools he knows for the purpose of determining resonant powers and using focus powers, even though he possesses only one physical item as an implement. This ability alters implements, mental focus, spellcasting, and implement mastery.</p><p><b>Battle Skill</b>: At 2nd level, a battle host's magic item skill ability applies only on checks with weapons, armor, and shields. This ability alters magic item skill.</p><p><b>Battle Reading</b>: At 2nd level, a battle host can use object reading on only weapons, armor, and shields. This ability alters object reading.</p><p><b>Bonus Feats</b>: At 4th, 8th, 12th, and 16th levels, a battle host gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats. The battle host must meet the prerequisites of these bonus feats. This ability replaces shift focus, magic circles, binding circles, and fast circles.</p><p><b>Spirit Warrior (Sp)</b>: At 5th level, a battle host can call forth the spirit of a dead warrior who once owned his bonded item. Calling the spirit is a standard action, and unlike the use of most spell-like abilities, it doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. This ability functions as <i>spiritual ally </i>(<i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide </i>246), using the battle host's occultist level as his caster level and his Intelligence modifier instead of his Wisdom modifier to determine the spell's effects. The battle host can summon a spirit warrior once per day at 5th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 occultist levels he possesses beyond 5th. This ability replaces aura sight.</p><p><b>Heroic Splendor (Su)</b>: At 6th level, a battle host can draw power from his bonded item to imbue himself with superhuman strength, agility, or resilience. As a swift action, a battle host can grant himself a +4 insight bonus to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution for 1 minute. The battle host can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 occultist levels he possesses beyond 6th. If he activates heroic splendor again before the duration expires, the new use of heroic splendor replaces the old use. This ability replaces outside contact.</p><h1>NECROCCULTIST (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Necroccultists' fascination with death and the undead drives them to explore the forbidden necromantic arts as they search for secrets they can use to manipulate the natural cycle of life and death. They contact and learn from the dead, rather than from items or outsiders, allowing them to drain the life of their foes to feed their own power, and even call forth phantasmal hordes of spirits to destroy their enemies.</p><p><b>Necromantic Bond (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a necroccultist gains access to only the necromancy school of implements. He must select necromancy for his implement mastery. Each time he gains an occultist level, a necroccultist can add one necromancy spell from the wizard spell list to his occultist spell list and his list of spells known. The necroccultist can't choose a spell of a higher level than he is able to cast, and he adds the spell at the same spell level it appears on the wizard spell list. At 14th level, he doesn't gain an additional school of implements. Instead, at 14th level, the DCs of saving throws to resist a necroccultist's necromancy spells and necromancy focus powers increase by 2. This ability alters implements and implement mastery.</p><p><b>Deadspeaker (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a necroccultist can learn the answers to a specific set of questions concerning a dead or undead creature. The necroccultist must consume at least one drop of the creature's blood, a small portion of its flesh, or a fragment of one of its bones as a part of this action. This ability otherwise functions as <i>blood biography </i>(<i>Advanced Player's Guide </i>206), using the necroccultist's occultist level as his caster level. The necroccultist can use this ability once per day at 2nd level, plus one additional time per day for every 2 occultist levels thereafter. This ability replaces object reading.</p><p><b>Ghostly Horde (Su)</b>: At 5th level, a necroccultist can spend 1 point of mental focus from a necromancy implement to summon a mob of ghostly spirits to harass his enemies. Summoning the ghostly horde is a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. The ghostly horde appears within 60 feet of the necroccultist, fills an area 20 feet in diameter, and always hovers a few inches off the ground (thus ignoring any difficult terrain). The necroccultist can command the ghostly horde to move up to 30 feet each round as a move action, though the farthest edge of the ghostly horde can never be more than 60 feet from the necroccultist. Any creature caught inside the ghostly horde takes 1d6 points of damage per 2 occultist levels at the start of its turn (up to a maximum of 10d6 points of damage at 20th level). A successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the necroccultist's occultist level + the necroccultist's Intelligence modifier) halves this damage. This damage is not negative energy-it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches as if from supernatural aging. Nonliving creatures and creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. The ghostly horde remains for 1 round, though at the beginning of his turn, the necroccultist can expend 1 point of mental focus as a swift action to extend the duration for 1 additional round. The necroccultist can use this ability once per day at 5th level, plus one additional time per day for every 5 occultist levels thereafter. This ability replaces aura sight.</p><p><b>Life Drain (Sp)</b>: At 8th level, a necroccultist can expend 1 point of mental focus from a necromancy implement to unleash a life-draining ray as a ranged touch attack that causes the target to accrue 1d4 negative levels. The ray has a range of 60 feet. The negative levels last a number of minutes equal to the necroccultist's occultist level. For each negative level this attack gives a target, the necroccultist regains a number of hit points equal to his occultist level. The necroccultist can use this ability once per day at 8th level, plus one additional time per day for every 3 occultist levels thereafter. This ability replaces outside contact.</p><h1>SHA'IR (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Sha'irs delve into the occult not through power over objects but instead via their connection with minor servitor genies from the elemental planes. A sha'ir's jin is both a precious ally and a living implement for its master.</p><p><b>Jin (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a sha'ir learns how to contact a jin-a minor, insubstantial genie that makes its home on the elemental planes. She learns how to contact a second jin at 6th level and a third jin at 14th level. Each of these jin is connected to one of the eight schools of magic, just like an occultist implement, but also to the air, earth, fire, or water school (<i>Advanced Player's Guide </i>142). Each jin works like a living implement for both of its schools. To provide the implement component for a spell or focus power, a jin must be within 30 feet of its master.</p><p>The elemental schools don't have focus powers or resonant powers. Instead, the sha'ir considers all wizard spells of 6th level and lower from the lists corresponding to her jin's elemental schools to be on her occultist spell list. In addition, she adds additional spells to her list of spells known. For every spell level she can cast, she adds one spell from each jin's elemental school and one spell from each jin's non-elemental school.</p><p>A jin in its natural form has the base statistics of a Small elemental of the chosen type with the young simple template and without the air mastery, burn, drench, earth glide, earth mastery, vortex, water mastery, or whirlwind abilities.</p><p>At 20th level, a sha'ir selects one of her jin and chooses one of its two schools instead of selecting an implement for implement mastery.</p><p>If one of her jin is slain, the sha'ir is treated as if she didn't have the appropriate implement to cast the spells associated with that jin. The sha'ir can replace the slain jin the following morning by expending 1 point of mental focus in a special ritual that takes 1 hour to perform.</p><p>This ability replaces implements and alters mental focus, spellcasting, and implement mastery.</p><p><b>Augment Jin (Sp, Su)</b>: Starting at 2nd level, a sha'ir's jin uses its master's base saving throws if they are better than its own, and it uses either its own hit point total or 1/2 its master's hit points, whichever is higher. At 4th level, a sha'ir can concentrate for 1 full round and expend 1 point of mental focus stored in a jin to grant that jin all the statistics of a Small elemental of its type for 1 round per occultist level (this includes gaining any of the following abilities, if applicable: air mastery, burn, drench, earth glide, earth mastery, vortex, water mastery, and whirlwind). At 8th level, she can instead expend 2 points of mental focus to give one of her jin all the statistics of a Medium elemental. At 10th level, the cost of giving a jin the statistics of a Medium elemental decreases to 1 point of mental focus, and the sha'ir can give a jin all the statistics of a Large elemental for 2 points of mental focus. At 12th level, the cost of giving a jin the statistics of a Large elemental decreases to 1 point of mental focus and the sha'ir can give a jin the statistics of a Huge elemental for 2 points of mental focus. At 14th level, the cost of giving a jin the statistics of a Huge elemental decreases to 1 point of mental focus and the sha'ir can give a jin the statistics of a greater elemental for 2 points of mental focus. At 16th level, the sha'ir can give a jin the statistics of an elder elemental for 3 points of mental focus. This ability replaces magic item skill and object reading.</p><p><b>Manifest Jin (Su)</b>: At 7th level, the sha'ir can designate one of her jin and manifest its powers, allowing it to count as a Small elemental at all times, as if using augment jin to augment it to a Small elemental but with a permanent duration. By concentrating for 1 full round, she can change which of her jin she manifests in this way. This ability replaces aura sight.</p><p><b>Jin Spy (Su)</b>: At 8th level, when a sha'ir gains her outside contact ability, instead of learning the true names of outsiders, she can ask one or more of her jin to perform tasks. She chooses from the same tasks listed under outside contact (as appropriate to her occultist level). This doesn't require negotiation or gifts, but the jin is not available to the sha'ir during the time it spends performing these tasks. This ability alters outside contact.</p><h1>TOME EATER (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Tome eaters have learned how to tap into the latent psychic energy of the written word by physically devouring books and scrolls to create magical effects and gain mystical insights. They use their bonded tomes to gain access to all sorts of magic, and as they grow in power, they gain an innate sense of the books and writings around them.</p><p><b>Bonded Tome (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a tome eater forms a supernatural bond with a specific book. She can replace her bonded tome with another book at any time, though the tome eater must perform a 24-hour binding ritual to attune herself to the new book.</p><p>The bonded tome starts as an implement for any two schools of magic at 1st level, and it gains access to additional schools of magic at 2nd, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels, granting the tome eater access to base focus powers and resonant powers accordingly. The tome eater's bonded tome serves as her implement component to cast occultist spells of all schools she knows.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>However, she must split her mental focus among the schools she knows for the purpose of determining resonant powers and using focus powers, even though she possesses only one physical item as an implement. Once per day as part of casting an occultist spell, a tome eater can expend 1 point of mental focus tied to the appropriate school to increase the spell's caster level by 1 or increase the spell's DC by 1. A tome eater can enhance a spell in this manner one additional time per day at 6th level, and another time per day for every 5 occultist levels she possesses beyond 6th. This ability alters implements, mental focus, spellcasting, and implement mastery.</p><p><b>Devour Books and Scrolls (Sp)</b>: A tome eater can devour books and scrolls in order to gain various benefits. Devouring a book or scroll is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A devoured book or scroll is absorbed into the tome eater's body and completely destroyed.</p><p>At 4th level, once per day a tome eater can devour a spell scroll or a book to regain mental focus, which she can divide as she likes among her schools of magic, to a maximum of the amount of mental focus she assigned to that school at the beginning of the day. If she devours a scroll, a tome eater regains a number of points of mental focus equal to the spell level of the highest-level spell contained on the scroll. If she devours a nonmagical book that contains at least 100 pages of written text and is worth at least 25 gp, a tome eater regains 1 point of mental focus. If she devours a magical book, she regains a number of points of mental focus equal to half the caster level of the item. If the tome eater devours a spellbook with at least 50 pages of spells of 1st level or higher, she regains 4 points of mental focus.</p><p>At 6th level, a tome eater can ready an action to devour an enemy's spell when an enemy within 30 feet attempts to cast a spell from a scroll. This ability works as the counterspell action as if the tome eater were using <i>dispel magic</i>, though the tome eater doesn't need to cast a spell to counter the enemy's spell. A tome eater can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 occultist levels beyond 6th. If a tome eater readies an action to use this ability and the readied action never triggers, she doesn't expend a daily use of this ability. At 16th level, the tome eater can use this ability as an immediate action without readying an action.</p><p>At 8th level, a tome eater can devour a book or scroll as a standard action. Additionally, whenever a tome eater successfully uses this ability to counter a spell being cast from a scroll, she can devour the enemy's scroll without spending any additional actions if she hasn't devoured a scroll or book yet that day.</p><p>At 12th level, a tome eater can devour a book or scroll as a move action. Additionally, whenever a tome eater successfully uses this ability to counter a spell being cast from a scroll, she can choose to turn the spell back on its caster (as <i>spell turning</i>) instead of devouring the scroll. She can do this whether or not she has devoured a scroll or book yet that day.</p><p>This ability replaces shift focus, the implement gained at 6th level, magic circles, outside contact, binding circles, and fast circles.</p><p><b>Word Sense (Sp, Su)</b>: At 5th level, a tome eater is constantly under the effect of <i>read magic</i>. Additionally, she can automatically detect the general topic of a piece of writing, and whether that writing is a magical scroll or tome, simply by looking at it. If she spends 1 round concentrating on a text within 30 feet per 100 pages of the text, she can gain a sense of a text's contents as if she had skimmed the text. This ability replaces aura sight.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypes\">^Archetypes</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"lyqtE3WrUw1xGPy8"}

{"name":"Chakras","permission":{"default":0,"JgpLZkPryhl1EFab":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_5ifacq93nyc","path":"Pathfinder RPG - Occult Adventures Reference Library#/CF_SEP/Occult Adventures#/CF_SEP/CHAPTER 5: OCCULT RULES","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\"></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>According to esoteric traditions, the vital force of ki derives from the Positive Energy Plane and flows to initiates via the emanations of the sun. To students of the occult, every star holds a gate to the realm of positive energy, and through these gates flows the force of life itself in the form of ki. Ki collects in seven mystical vortices within the body called chakras. When observing a living creature's etheric double-its manifestation on the Ethereal Plane-its chakras appear as small disks whirling with brilliant, colorful energy. The chakras distribute this energy throughout the creature's physical body, granting it animate force and giving order to its constituent molecules.</p><p>Enlightened initiates versed in the mysteries of ki can awaken their chakras to unlock fabulous mystical powers, but doing so means channeling an even more dangerous and esoteric life force than ki-the potent and ancient kundalini, also known as the serpent-fire.</p><p>Unlike ki, kundalini flows not from the heavens above but from the ground below. Some mystics claim its colorful name derives from the fact that its mastery was first pioneered by the ancient serpentfolk who ruled the world millennia ago, but another explanation is that kundalini energy flows through the seven chakras in a coiling, ophidian manner. The kundalini flow awakens each chakra in turn. As it progresses from the root chakra at the base of the spine to the crown chakra at the top of the head, the serpent-fire opens new vistas of personal power to the initiate, granting her unique supernatural abilities.</p><h1>ACTIVATING CHAKRAS</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Awakening the chakras requires a basic mastery of ki energy techniques, and is possible only for an initiate with the ki pool class feature or some other means of utilizing ki (such as the rogue's ki pool rogue talent from page 69 of <i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat</i>). The initiate must also possess the Psychic Sensitivity feat (see page 138) or have levels in one of the occult classes presented in this book.</p><p>Awakening chakras or maintaining awakened chakras is a swift action that costs 1 ki point. On the first round, this opens the root chakra. Each round after the first, it opens the next chakra in the sequence, up to the crown chakra on the seventh round.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Once the initiate has begun awakening his chakras, each round he must continue opening chakras or maintain his awakened chakras, or all of his chakras close and he must begin again from the root chakra. If he pauses in the progression, he can resume it at any time, provided he has spent 1 ki point per round in the meanwhile to maintain his open chakras.</p><p>Each round, when expending the ki for that round, the initiate can select the benefit from one chakra awakened up to that point. For example, if after 4 rounds the initiate has awakened three chakras, he can gain the ability of any of those three. To open a chakra, the initiate's character level (or total HD) must equal at least double the chakra's rank. For example, an initiate must be 14th level to open his crown chakra.</p><p>Manipulation of the serpent-fire involves considerable risk. Every round in which a character has one or more awakened chakras, he must succeed at Fortitude and Will saving throws, adding his Charisma modifier to each save, to resist the inherent dangers of the kundalini flow as it suffuses his body with spiritual fire. The save DCs are equal to 10 + the sum of the ranks of the awakened chakras. For example, awakening the root, sacral, and navel chakras would result in a DC of 16. Opening all seven chakras at once results in DC 38 saves. The save DC totals are listed after each chakra's rank and title. If the initiate fails the Fortitude save, he takes 1d6 points of damage per awakened chakra. If the initiate fails the Will save, he is overcome with visions related to the emotions and concepts associated with the awakened chakras, causing him to be dazed for 1 round and causing all of his chakras to close.</p><p><b>1. Root Chakra (DC 11)</b>: The root chakra is associated with instinct, security, survival, and potential for greater development. It energizes the desires of the flesh and distributes ki throughout the blood to circulate heat to the body. Kundalini energy is sometimes depicted as a serpent coiled around the root chakra, ready to ascend on a path from the body's lower, basic urges and instincts to the heights of a disciplined and enlightened mind.</p><p>By awakening his root chakra, the initiate opens himself to an inflow of serpent-fire energy. The bloom of occult power strengthens his aura, granting him DR/- equal to the number of chakras opened for 1 round. The initiate must be at least 2nd level before he can open this chakra.</p><p><b>2. Sacral Chakra (DC 13)</b>: The sacral chakra is closely associated with the generative power of the reproductive cycle, as well as pleasure, addiction, creativity, emotional needs, and relationships. When the sacral chakra is awakened, the adept recalls moments of sensual or creative ecstasy, when consciousness slips from the physical body into astral realms of weightless bliss. When opened, the sacral chakra gleams with sunlike radiance.</p><p>By awakening his sacral chakra, the initiate gains a fly speed equal to his base movement for 1 round with average maneuverability. The movement must begin and end on a solid surface. The initiate must be at least 4th level before he can open this chakra.</p><p><b>3. Navel Chakra (DC 16)</b>: The navel chakra is sometimes called the power chakra, for it is associated with fire, combustion, digestion, anger, joy, fear, anxiety, and laughter. Here the serpent-fire swirls and swells with heat and vital energy, the source of the so-called \"fire in the belly\" of common parlance.</p><p>Upon awakening his navel chakra, the initiate can channel the serpent-fire as a breath attack that deals 2d8 points of damage in a 30-foot cone. This radiant gout of orange-red liquid flame somewhat resembles fire, but bypasses all forms of energy resistance, protection, and immunity. The amount of damage increases by 1d8 for each open chakra beyond the 3rd, to a maximum of 6d8 if all of the chakras are awakened. The initiate must be at least 6th level before he can open this chakra.</p><p><b>4. Heart Chakra (DC 20)</b>: The heart chakra is the seat of higher feelings and emotions, an inner realm of compassion, tenderness, love, and rejection. When infused with the substance of a creature's aura, the energies of the heart chakra can take on powerful healing capabilities.</p><p>Once the heart chakra has been awakened, the initiate can channel his serpent-fire into a torrent of healing energy. He can use this ability on himself or touch any adjacent living creature with this fire to heal an amount of damage equal to 1d8 + double the number of chakras he has awakened. In addition, he can remove one of the following conditions from the creature healed: confused, nauseated, sickened, staggered, or stunned. This fire has no effect on constructs, undead, or other creatures that are not alive. The initiate must be at least 8th level before he can open this chakra.</p><p><b>5. Throat Chakra (DC 25)</b>: Speech and hearing are nothing more than vibrations, and the throat chakra thrums with the occult vibrations that govern existence. Here the urges and emotions of the lower chakras give way to more refined, cerebral vistas, making the throat chakra the bridge between feeling and thinking.</p><p>By awakening the throat chakra, the initiate can tap into the primordial mystical language underlying all things-the raw tongue of the multiverse that gives motion to atoms, keeps planets rotating in infinite space, and orders the coruscations of the stars. When using this chakra, the initiate slips into a kind of trance. He can take actions as normal, but he constantly mutters incoherent, often disturbing utterances of a vastly primal nature. Each round, he can select one enemy within 30 feet. That foe must succeed at a Will save to resist becoming staggered for 1 round. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the initiate's total Hit Dice + his Charisma modifier. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The initiate must be at least 10th level before he can open this chakra.</p><p><b>6. Brow Chakra (DC 31)</b>: Also called the intuitive chakra, this force center governs occult vision, both literal and metaphorical. Once the brow chakra has been opened, the initiate gains the benefits of <i>true seeing </i>for 1 round. Engaging this force center literally opens a shining third eye of psychic energy upon the initiate's forehead. The mystical eye is easily perceived by anyone looking at the initiate, and persists so long as he maintains the brow chakra. The initiate must be at least 12th level before he can open this chakra.</p><p><b>7. Crown Chakra (DC 38)</b>: Channeling serpent-fire through all seven chakras at the same time aligns the initiate's life energy to its utmost potential, bathing his aura in glimmering golden hues that illuminate his head like a gleaming halo. For the briefest of moments, he transcends mortality to become a being of temporary divinity. This alignment with the cosmic harmony of the multiverse grants him enormous sway over probability.</p><p>Once the crown chakra is opened, the initiate becomes fully in tune with the powers of the multiverse, allowing him to gain the benefit of any two distinct chakras each round. He gains this benefit even if he doesn't select the crown chakra. If he selects the crown chakra, every time he would roll a d20 during that turn (such as when attempting an attack roll, a saving throw, or a skill check), he can roll twice and take the higher result. The initiate must be at least 14th level before he can open this chakra.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter5occultrules\">^Occult Rules</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter6runninganoccultgame\">Running an Occult Game</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"mr9f1vZko6EaUhHU"}

The DC to create the construct still increases for any necessary spells that the alchemist does not have access to (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook </i>549). However, the alchemist can use extracts in place of spells as spell prerequisites. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.</p><h1>ECTOCHYMIST (ALCHEMIST ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Ectochymists study the effects of alchemy on soul and spirit, focusing on fighting ghosts and other incorporeal creatures.</p><p><b>Class Skills</b>: An ectochymist adds Knowledge (religion) to his list of class skills. This alters the alchemist's class skills.</p><p><b>Ectoplasmic Blanche (Su)</b>: An ectochymist can alchemically treat a melee weapon so that it deals full damage to incorporeal creatures. The process requires a full-round action and lasts until the next time that weapon is used to make an attack. An ectochymist can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier. This ability replaces bombs.</p><p><b>Cool-Headed (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, an ectochymist gains a +2 bonus on saves against death, fear, and negative energy effects. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at 8th level. This ability replaces poison resistance.</p><p><b>Advanced Ectochymistry (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, a weapon coated in an ectochymist's ectoplasmic blanche also deals full damage to haunts. This ability replaces poison use.</p><p><b>Swift Ectochymistry (Su)</b>: At 6th level, an ectochymist can use ectoplasmic blanche on one of his own weapons as a swift action. When coated on a weapon wielded by the ectochymist, ectoplasmic blanche lasts for a number of attacks equal to the ectochymist's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 attack). This ability replaces swift poisoning.</p><p><b>Ghost Trap (Su)</b>: At 8th level, an ectochymist can throw a trap to capture an incorporeal creature of up to 1 Hit Die per alchemist level he possesses. As a standard action, the ectochymist can expend a use of ectoplasmic blanche to coat the inside of a container with his blanche and throw it at an incorporeal creature as a ranged touch attack. If he hits, the creature receives a Will save to escape the trap (DC = 10 + 1/2 his alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier). If the creature fails its save, it is sealed within the vessel until someone breaks or opens that vessel. The ghost trap automatically survives being thrown at the incorporeal creature, but otherwise is only as durable as the vessel (normally hardness 5, 1 hp for a glass bottle).This ability replaces the 8th-level alchemist discovery.</p><p><b>Ectochymical Analysis (Sp)</b>: At 10th level, an ectochymist can use alchemical processes to uncover esoteric knowledge from a haunted area that would normally require divinations to ascertain. This process takes 10 minutes and expends one use of ectoplasmic blanche. Treat this effect as <i>speak with haunt</i>(APG) with a saving throw DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the ectochymist's class level + the ectochymist's Charisma modifier and a caster level equal to the ectochymist's class level. Because the ectochymist is performing an analysis to answer his questions and not speaking with the haunt directly, he uses Craft (alchemy) rather than Sense Motive to oppose any Bluff checks the spirit might attempt in order to mislead him. This ability replaces poison immunity.</p><p><b>Discoveries</b>: The following discoveries complement the ectochymist archetype: alchemical simulacrum(UM), cognatogen(UM), grand cognatogen(UM), greater alchemical simulacrum(UM), and mummification(UM).</p><h1>PROMETHEAN ALCHEMIST (ALCHEMIST ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Obsessed with discovering the origins of life, promethean alchemists build constructs they gradually endow with life.</p><p><b>Craft Construct</b>: At 1st level, a promethean alchemist gains the promethean disciple discovery (see above). This ability replaces Brew Potion and Throw Anything.</p><p><b>Homunculus Companion (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a promethean alchemist gains the service of a homunculus companion. The means for creating this special homunculus are more exotic than normal and require investiture of the promethean alchemist's own life essence into the homunculus. This construct generally resembles a small humanoid or child when first created; the specific appearance is up to its creator, though a homunculus is always humanoid in shape and obviously unnatural on close inspection.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>While every homunculus companion is absolutely devoted to its master, some homunculi's loyalty borders on the unsettling; such companions jealously protect their masters from threats or construct strange shrines in their masters' honor. A homunculus companion can be of any alignment, even one that is different from its master's. A destroyed homunculus companion can be restored to life by performing a ritual with its corpse that requires 1 pint of its creator's blood per Hit Die of the homunculus and rare materials worth 100 gp per Hit Die of the homunculus.</p><p>Performing this ritual takes 1 hour (though it may take some time to gather enough blood at higher levels, so many promethean alchemists keep chilled blood samples in storage just in case). A promethean alchemist can't take the mutagen or cognatogen discoveries. This ability replaces bombs and mutagen.</p><p><b>Discoveries</b>: The following discoveries complement this archetype: alchemical simulacrum(UM), doppelganger simulacrum(UM), and greater alchemical simulacrum(UM).</p><h1>Homunculus Companion Base Statistics</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Table 2-2: Homunculus Companions</h1><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td

Table 2-2 on page 114.</p><p><b>Level</b>: This is the homunculus's master's alchemist level.</p><p><b>HD</b>: This is the homunculus's total number of 10-sided (d10) Hit Dice. The homunculus doesn't have a Constitution score, but it gains bonus hit points based on its size.</p><p><b>BAB</b>: This is the base attack bonus of the homunculus, which is equal to its number of Hit Dice.</p><p><b>Saves</b>: These are the base saving throw bonuses of the homunculus.</p><p><b>Skills</b>: This entry lists the homunculus's total number of skill ranks. A homunculus with a high Intelligence score modifies these totals as normal (the homunculus gains a number of skill ranks equal to 2 + its Intelligence modifier per HD). A homunculus can't have more ranks in a skill than it has Hit Dice.</p><p><i>Homunculus Class Skills</i>: The following skills are class skills for a homunculus: Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Perception (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Stealth (Dex). In addition, at 1st level, a promethean alchemist can choose two additional skills to be class skills for his homunculus.</p><p><b>Feats</b>: This is the total number of feats the homunculus has. A homunculus can select any feats it qualifies for, but must possess the appropriate appendages in order to use some feats.</p><p><b>Str/Dex Bonus</b>: Add this modifier to the homunculus's Strength and Dexterity.</p><p><b>Special</b>: As the homunculus increases in power, it gains the special abilities described below.</p><p><i>Darkvision (Ex)</i>: The homunculus has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.</p><p><i>Low-Light Vision (Ex)</i>: Homunculi see twice as far as humans in dim light.</p><p><i>Sympathetic Alchemy (Su)</i>: The bond between a promethean alchemist and his homunculus is so close that the alchemist's extracts function for the homunculus as if it were the alchemist, allowing the homunculus companion to benefit from extracts without the alchemist needing the infusion discovery. The homunculus is treated as a humanoid or a construct-whichever is more beneficial-for the purposes of what extracts can affect it. Additionally, the homunculus can prepare its master's extracts from his formula book for him each day, as long as it's within the range of its telepathic link.</p><p><i>Telepathic Link (Su)</i>: A homunculus can't initially speak, but shares a telepathic link with its creator. It knows what its master knows and can convey to him everything it sees and hears, out to a range of 1,500 feet.</p><p><i>Weapon and Armor Proficiency (Ex)</i>: A homunculus is proficient with simple weapons, but not armor or shields.</p><p><i>Evasion (Ex)</i>: At 3rd level, if a homunculus is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex save for half damage, it takes no damage if it succeeds at its saving throw.</p><p><i>Ability Score Increase (Ex)</i>: The homunculus adds 1 to one of its ability scores at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.</p><p><i>Speech (Ex)</i>: At 6th level, the homunculus gains the ability to speak any languages it knows.</p><p><i>Spell Resistance (Su)</i>: At 9th level, the homunculus gains spell resistance equal to 11 + its master's alchemist level.</p><p><i>Improved Evasion (Ex)</i>: At 15th level, when subjected to an attack that allows a Reflex save for half damage, the homunculus takes no damage if it succeeds at the saving throw and only half damage if it fails the saving throw.</p><h1>Homunculus Starting Statistics</h1><p><b>Size </b>Small; <b>Speed </b>20 ft., fly 30 ft. (poor); <b>AC </b>+2 natural armor; <b>Attack </b>bite (1d4); <b>Ability Scores </b>Str 10, Dex 15, Con -, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 7; <b>Special Qualities </b>darkvision, low-light vision; <b>Languages </b>Common (can't speak).</p><h1>4th-Level Advancement</h1><p><b>Size </b>Medium; <b>Speed </b>30 ft., fly 40 ft.

The additional benefits and penalties from a flesheater's abilities last only as long as her rage does, and she cannot use these abilities if they would bring the total penalty to Intelligence to an amount equal to or greater than her Intelligence score. This ability alters the rage ability.</p><p><b>One Flesh (Su)</b>: At 2nd level when entering a rage, a flesheater can spend an additional round of rage and take an additional -2 penalty to Intelligence to take on a single ability of the valid consumed creature whose flesh she ate most recently. For the purpose of this ability, a valid consumed creature is any dead animal, dragon, humanoid, or magical beast that died and was consumed by the flesheater within the past 24 hours. She can choose any ability listed under <i>beast shape I</i>, as long as the creature possessed that ability. At 5th level, the flesheater can take on any number of the creature's abilities that are listed under <i>beast shape I</i>. At 8th level, the flesheater can instead take on one of the creature's abilities listed under <i>beast shape II</i>. The flesheater's appearance alters to resemble the consumed creature, but she does not change shape. This is a polymorph effect. This ability replaces uncanny dodge, improved uncanny dodge, and the 2nd- and 8th-level rage powers.</p><p><b>Unbound Rage (Su)</b>: At 11th level, a flesheater can draw in mass from the Ethereal Plane to enlarge herself when she enters a rage, as long as the creature whose flesh she last consumed was at least one size category larger than her base size. Unbound rage affects her as <i>enlarge person</i>, except she receives a +4 size bonus to Strength and an additional -2 penalty to Intelligence. This ability replaces greater rage.</p><p><b>Feast (Su)</b>: At 14th level, a flesheater can use her one flesh and unbound rage abilities to emulate any one valid consumed creature of her choice, rather than only the one she consumed most recently. This ability replaces the 14th-level rage power.</p><p><b>Unbound Form (Su)</b>: At 20th level, a flesheater can use her one flesh ability to assume the shape of a valid consumed creature. This ability functions as <i>alter self</i>, <i>beast shape IV</i>, <i>form of the dragon III</i>, or <i>giant form II</i>, as appropriate. This is a polymorph effect. This ability replaces mighty rage.</p><p><b>Rage Powers</b>: The following rage powers complement the flesheater archetype: animal fury, beast totem(APG) (any), inspire ferocity(APG), internal fortitude, and terrifying howl.</p><h1>PHRENOLOGIST (BARD ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>The phrenologist is an expert at reading creatures' skulls, and he learns to use this knowledge to his benefit.</p><p><b>Phrenological Knowledge (Ex)</b>: A phrenologist is an expert at reading creatures' skulls. He gains Psychic Sensitivity* as a bonus feat, and he can use the phrenology skill unlock even if he is untrained in Knowledge (arcana).</p><p>He adds half his class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge (arcana) checks for the phrenology occult skill unlock. This ability replaces bardic knowledge.</p><p><b>Skull-Versed (Ex)</b>: Starting at 2nd level, a phrenologist can use knowledge gleaned from a creature's skull to tailor a performance. All creatures on which the phrenologist has successfully used his phrenology skill unlock take a -2 penalty on all saving throws against the phrenologist's bardic performances. This ability replaces well-versed.</p><p><b>Phrenological Savant</b>: At 10th level, a phrenologist gains either Psychic Maestro* or Psychic Virtuoso* as a bonus feat. If he chooses Psychic Maestro, he must select phrenology as one of his two skill unlocks to use an additional time. This ability replaces jack-of-all-trades.</p><p><b>Bardic Performance</b>: A phrenologist gains the following types of bardic performance.</p><p><i>Skull Sonata (Su)</i>: At 1st level, a phrenologist learns to use the resonance of other creatures' skulls to increase sonic damage. All enemies within 30 feet of the phrenologist that have skulls take an amount of additional sonic damage equal to half the phrenologist's bard level (minimum 1) each time they take sonic damage. Skull sonata relies on audible components. This ability replaces inspire courage.</p><p><i>In Your Head (Sp)</i>: At 3rd level, a phrenologist can use his performance to send his own senses into another's skull, as the spell <i>witness</i>(UM) (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phrenologist's class level + his Charisma modifier). At 11th level, this performance's duration increases to 10 minutes per bard level, and at 19th level, the duration increases to 1 hour per bard level. In your head relies on audible components. This ability replaces inspire competence.</p><p><i>Fingers of Fascination (Su)</i>: When a phrenologist uses the fascinate bardic performance, he can send forth psychic fingers along with his performance, allowing him to study one of the fascinated creatures with his phrenology skill unlock without touching its head physically and without it being helpless, willing, or paralyzed. This does not spend his daily use of the phrenology skill unlock. This ability alters fascinate.</p><h1>SILVER BALLADEER (BARD ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>The bright purity of silver makes beautiful music, and its vibrations are also anathema to unnatural creatures. Some bards use a mixture of silver-stringed instruments and esoteric knowledge to battle the dark forces of the world.</p><p><b>Alignment</b>: A silver balladeer must have a good alignment. This ability alters alignment.</p><p><b>Bardic Performance</b>: A silver balladeer gains the bardic performances listed below. These bardic performances all require the use of a silver or silver-stringed instrument, which costs twice as much as a normal masterwork instrument.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><i>Break Curse (Su)</i>: At 6th level, a silver balladeer can suppress a single curse affecting an ally within 30 feet that is able to see and hear her. Each round the silver balladeer uses break curse, she attempts a Perform check against the original DC of the curse. If successful, she suppresses the curse for 1 round. After she has suppressed the curse for 4 consecutive rounds, she can attempt a caster level check to remove the curse as if she had cast <i>remove curse</i>. This ability replaces suggestion.</p><p><i>Holy Vibration (Su)</i>: At 9th level, a silver balladeer can spend a round of bardic performance to make a single door or a window within 30 feet resonate with a holy vibration. Undead and creatures with the evil subtype are unable to open a door or window affected in this way (as <i>arcane lock</i>) for 10 minutes per bard level. If such a creature has the incorporeal subtype, it is unable to move through the affected door or window, or through any walls, floors, or ceilings within 20 feet of it. Incorporeal creatures can attempt Charisma checks to break through areas warded by holy vibration, using the same break DC as for the object the creature is trying to move through. This ability replaces inspire greatness.</p><p><i>Mass Break Curse (Su)</i>: At 18th level, a silver balladeer can suppress all curses among any number of allies within 30 feet when using break curse. Every 4 consecutive rounds of using this performance, the silver balladeer can attempt a caster level check to remove a single curse on a single ally affected by this performance, as if she had cast <i>remove curse</i>. This ability replaces mass suggestion.</p><p><b>Pure Heart (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, a silver balladeer gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against curses, hexes, and charm effects. This ability replaces well-versed.</p><p><b>Silver Mastery (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, a silver balladeer treats silver weapons as if they were also cold iron for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Also, alchemical silver weapons do not impose a penalty on damage rolls when wielded by a silver balladeer, and a silver balladeer gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls made with mithral weapons. This ability replaces the 2nd-level versatile performance.</p><h1>ORDER OF THE EASTERN STAR (CAVALIER ORDER)</h1><p>This cavalier order exists to keep dangerous secrets hidden from the world and secretly protect the world against unimaginable threats from beyond the mortal realms. These cavaliers scout and observe, concerning themselves not with the trivial pursuit of morality, but rather with ensuring the survival of society itself.</p><p><b>Edicts</b>: The cavalier must preserve the secrets of his order while acting to protect civilization against occult threats. He must thwart the schemes of otherworldly horrors and must give his order a full accounting of any potential threats.</p><p><b>Challenge</b>: Whenever a cavalier of the order of the eastern star issues a challenge, he receives a +1 dodge bonus to AC and a +1 insight bonus on saves against the attacks and abilities of the target of his challenge. He must be wearing light armor and carrying no more than a light load to receive these bonuses. These bonuses increase by 1 for every 4 class levels the cavalier possesses.</p><p><b>Skills</b>: A cavalier belonging to the order of the eastern star adds Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (planes) to his class skills. He can attempt Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (planes) checks untrained. If he has ranks in these skills, as long as a check involves knowledge of the occult or supernatural, he receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1).</p><p><b>Feats</b>: A cavalier of this order gains Psychic Sensitivity as a bonus feat.</p><p><b>Order Abilities</b>: A cavalier belonging to this order gains the following abilities as he increases in level.</p><p><i>Guarded (Ex)</i>: At 2nd level, the cavalier gains DR 1/- and a +2 morale bonus on saving throws when wearing light armor or no armor and fighting defensively or using Combat Expertise. At 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter, this DR increases by 1. He loses the benefits of this ability if carrying a medium or heavier load.</p><p><i>Pierce the Guard (Ex)</i>: At 8th level, when attacking with a light or one-handed weapon, the cavalier ignores the penalty for fighting defensively or using Combat Expertise on his first melee attack roll each round. If fighting with two weapons, he ignores the penalty for the first attack with each weapon, as long as the off-hand weapon is a light weapon. The cavalier can't use this ability with double weapons.</p><p><i>One Purpose (Ex)</i>: At 15th level, the cavalier's mount shares the benefits of the cavalier's guarded ability as long as both are wearing light or no armor and carrying no more than a light load. The cavalier must fight defensively or use Combat Expertise to grant these benefits, but the mount need not. In addition, the mount gains all the benefits of the cavalier's challenge, regardless of what barding it wears.</p><h1>ORDER OF THE SHROUD (CAVALIER ORDER)</h1><p>Cavaliers of this order seek out and destroy undead and those who harbor or create them. They scour old crypts, graveyards, and battlefields to bring eternal rest.</p><p><b>Edicts</b>: The cavalier must protect the common folk from the scourge of the undead. He must seek out and destroy the restless dead and give aid to those haunted by them. He must protect those who cannot defend themselves, and root out sources that birth the corruption of life and death.</p><p><b>Challenge</b>: Whenever an order of the shroud cavalier issues a challenge to an undead creature, he receives a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against the target of his challenge for 1 minute. The bonus increases by 1 for every 4 class levels the cavalier possesses.</p><p><b>Skills</b>: An order of the shroud cavalier adds Knowledge (local) (Int) and Knowledge (religion) (Int) to his list of class skills. An order of the shroud cavalier can attempt Knowledge (religion) checks untrained. If he has ranks in that skill, as long as a Knowledge (religion) check involves undead or haunts, he receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1).</p><p><b>Order Abilities</b>: A cavalier belonging to the order of the shroud gains the following abilities as he increases in level.</p><p><i>Spiritual Shield (Su)</i>: At 2nd level, the cavalier can call upon the spirits of the fallen for protection. Once per day as an immediate action when attacked by an undead target of his challenge, the cavalier can gain a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier to his AC against that attack. The cavalier must decide to use this ability before the attack roll.</p><p><i>Destroyer of the Undead (Su)</i>: At 8th level, the cavalier's weapons are treated as having the cavalier's alignment for the purpose of overcoming the damage reduction of undead creatures. Against an undead target of his challenge, the cavalier automatically overcomes all damage reduction that undead possesses.</p><p><i>Stand Against Darkness (Ex or Su)</i>: At 15th level, the cavalier can take revenge on undead that dare strike him or those he seeks to protect. Whenever an undead creature that is the subject of his challenge hits the cavalier or an adjacent ally with a melee attack, the creature provokes an attack of opportunity from the cavalier. The cavalier gains a +2 morale bonus on attacks of opportunity provoked as a result of this ability. If an undead subject of the cavalier's challenge threatens a critical hit against the cavalier, the cavalier gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier against the confirmation roll. This bonus functions as a supernatural ability.</p><h1>GHOST RIDER (CAVALIER ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Ghost riders are conflicted warriors who use the powers of the phantasmal dead even while seeking out and banishing the corruption of undeath from plagued communities. Their strange abilities mark them as outsiders and stoic loners, and they stay in one place only long enough to help the afflicted before riding off to unknown destinations.</p><p><b>Ghost Mount (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a ghost rider gains the ability to manifest a special mount of conjured ectoplasm rather than one of flesh and bone. This spectral companion functions like a spiritualist's phantom companion, using the ghost rider's cavalier level as her effective spiritualist level.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>The phantom takes the form of a ghostly creature analogous to one of a cavalier's normal mount options for her size and class level, such as a Large horse for a Medium ghost rider or a wolf for a Small ghost rider. A ghost rider must choose a mount that is capable of bearing her weight, that has four or more legs, and that lacks a fly speed (although the GM may allow mounts with a swim speed in certain environments). The GM might approve other animals as suitable mounts.</p><p>The ghost rider can manifest her ghost mount only in ectoplasmic form, and she gains the spiritualist's etheric tether class feature, applied to her ghost mount. The mount shares the cavalier's alignment. Though the mount cannot speak, it understands its master's verbal commands and gains the phantom's link ability. The ghost mount has good Fortitude and Reflex saves, and can have ranks in any of the following skills: Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Escape Artist (Dex), Fly (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Perception (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str). The ghost rider's ghost mount does not gain the share spells, deliver touch spells, or incorporeal flight abilities. Ghost mounts do not gain emotional focus abilities.</p><p>The ghost rider does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding her mount. The mount is always considered combat trained, and begins play with Endurance as a bonus feat.</p><p><i>Ghost Mount Starting Statistics</i>: <b>Type </b>animal (phantom); <b>Size </b>one size category larger than the ghost rider; <b>Speed </b>50 ft.; <b>AC </b>+4 natural armor; <b>Attack </b>bite (1d4), 2 hooves (1d6; this is a secondary natural attack); <b>Ability Scores </b>Str 16, Dex 13, Con 15, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 6.</p><p>This ability replaces mount.</p><p><b>Frightful Gaze (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a ghost rider can use this ability on opponents within 30 feet as a standard action, which acts as a gaze attack until the ghost rider's next turn. Creatures within range that meet the ghost rider's gaze must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the ghost rider's class level + the ghost rider's Charisma modifier) or stand paralyzed in fear for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Creatures that successfully save against that ghost rider's frightful gaze are immune to it for 24 hours. At 9th level, this ability can affect creatures that are mindless or immune to mind-affecting effects, though it still counts as a fear effect. The ghost rider can use this ability a number of times each day equal to her Charisma modifier.</p><p>This ability replaces tactician, greater tactician, and master tactician.</p><p><b>Fearless (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, a ghost rider becomes immune to fear. Each ally within 10 feet of the ghost rider gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. This ability functions only while the ghost rider is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead. This ability replaces cavalier's charge.</p><p><b>Spirited Mount (Su)</b>: At 5th level, the ghost rider's mount ignores difficult terrain. At 8th level, it gains the ability to use <i>water walk </i>at will. This ability replaces expert trainer and banner.</p><p><b>Ghost Wind (Su)</b>: At 11th level, the ghost rider's ghost mount can use <i>air walk </i>(as the spell, no action required) at will for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground. At 14th level, the mount can fly at its speed with a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to the ghost rider's class level. This ability replaces mighty charge and greater banner.</p><h1>SENSATE (FIGHTER ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>A sensate perceives battle through senses beyond mortal ken, anticipating his opponents' movements before they even begin to act. As long as he keeps his focus about him, he fights with a skill rivaling that of the finest masters-at-arms.</p><p><b>Skills</b>: The sensate's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str). This replaces the fighter's class skills.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: Sensates are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). This replaces the fighter's weapon and armor proficiency.</p><p><b>Guarded Senses (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, a sensate gains a +1 bonus on saves against sonic effects, figments, glamers, patterns, gaze attacks, and scent-based attacks. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels the sensate possesses beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.</p><p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, a sensate gains uncanny dodge as the barbarian ability of the same name, except supernatural in nature. This ability replaces armor training 1.</p><p><b>Centered Senses (Su)</b>: At 5th level, a sensate can center his senses as a move action. While centered, a sensate gains a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and Will saves. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter. A sensate loses his centered state if he gains the confused, dazed, fascinated, staggered, or stunned condition; falls unconscious; or fails a Will save. This ability replaces weapon training 2, 3, and 4.</p><p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Su)</b>: At 7th level, a sensate gains improved uncanny dodge as the barbarian ability of the same name, except supernatural in nature. This ability replaces armor training 2.</p><p><b>Evasion (Su)</b>: At 11th level, a sensate gains evasion while using centered senses. This functions as the rogue ability of the same name, except that it is supernatural in nature and works regardless of the sensate's armor and encumbrance. This ability replaces armor training 3.</p><p><b>Steady (Su)</b>: At 15th level, a sensate can center himself as a swift action. This ability replaces armor training 4.</p><p><b>Perfect Senses (Su)</b>: At 19th level, a sensate's senses reach perfection, and he can easily notice illusions and unseen foes by combining his senses. While centered, he gains the effects of <i>true seeing </i>as well as blindsense 60 feet. An unseen creature that makes no sound and leaves no scent (such as a creature under the effects of <i>invisibility</i>, <i>silence</i>, and <i>negate aroma</i>) can still avoid both the <i>true seeing </i>and the blindsense. This ability replaces armor mastery.</p><p><b>Precision (Su)</b>: At 20th level, a sensate rolls twice to confirm critical hits while centered, taking the more favorable result. Opponents must roll twice to confirm critical hits against him, taking the less favorable result. The latter ability does not function when the sensate is denied his Dexterity bonus. This ability replaces weapon mastery.</p><h1>RELIC HUNTER (INQUISITOR ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Some inquisitors specialize in the use and recovery of long-lost relics of their faiths, drawing forth divine might from the recovered items in order to restore their sanctity and wield these artifacts against the enemies of their gods.</p><p><b>Spells</b>: A relic hunter casts divine spells drawn from the inquisitor spell list, but her chosen relic schools (see Relics below) limit her to schools she knows, similar in function to an occultist's implements. Any spell or orison gained by the relic hunter has a relic component (see Relics below), and is not considered to be on the relic hunter's spell list until she selects its school though the relics alternate class feature. Once she chooses a school, all spells and orisons of that school are considered to be on the relic hunter's class spell list, allowing her to use spell trigger and spell completion magic items of those spells. A relic hunter's spells per day, daily spell allotment, Difficulty Class, and minimum Wisdom score requirements remain unchanged from the inquisitor's normal spellcasting class feature. This ability alters the inquisitor's spellcasting.</p><p><b>Relics (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a relic hunter gains the occultist's implements class feature (see page 47) and learns to use two occultist implement schools as relic schools. At 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the relic hunter learns to use one additional relic school drawn from the same source, gaining access to that school's resonant power and base focus power and opening up that school's focus powers for her to select. Like an occultist, a relic hunter can select the same school twice, but it is far less useful for her to do so.</p><p>Relics do not need to be magic items, and nonmagical relics do not take up a magic item slot. Relics that are not magic items are often of some religious significance to the relic hunter or her church, such as the battered shield of a saint, a bishop's robe, or the finger bone of a church martyr.</p><p>This ability replaces judgment.</p><p><b>Deific Focus (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a relic hunter learns to invest divine power into her chosen relics. This acts like the occultist's focus powers and mental focus class features (see pages 47 and 48, respectively), with the following adjustments.</p><p>Each day, a relic hunter has a number of points of deific focus equal to her inquisitor level + her Wisdom modifier, and she must spend 1 hour in prayer with her relics to invest them with divine power. These points refresh at the start of each day.</p><p>At 1st level, the relic hunter learns the two base focus powers from her chosen relic schools and can select one more focus power from the list of those made available by her chosen schools. Whenever she gains a new relic school, she gains the base focus power of that school. In addition, at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, she learns a new focus power selected from all of the powers granted by all of the relic schools she knows. She can use these focus powers only by expending points of deific focus. Unless otherwise noted, the DC for any saving throws against a focus power is equal to 10 + 1/2 the inquisitor's class level + the inquisitor's Wisdom modifier. She cannot select a focus power more than once. She uses her inquisitor level in place of an occultist level to qualify for focus powers.</p><p>This ability replaces domain, bane, greater bane, second judgment, and third judgment.</p><h1>PSYCHIC DETECTIVE (INVESTIGATOR ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>A psychic detective supplements her keen insight with occult skill to unravel mysteries both ordinary and supernatural.</p><p><b>Class Skills</b>: The psychic detective does not receive Acrobatics, Climb, or Perform as class skills. This alters the investigator's class skills.</p><p><b>Spells</b>: A psychic detective casts psychic spells drawn from the psychic class spell list (see page 69) and augmented by a select set of additional spells (see Psychic Detective Spells on page 120). Only spells from the psychic class spell list of 6th level or lower and psychic detective spells are considered to be part of the psychic detective's spell list.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>If a spell appears on both the psychic detective and psychic class spell lists, the psychic detective uses the spell level from the psychic detective spell list. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a psychic detective must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell's level. The saving throw DC against a psychic detective's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the psychic detective's Intelligence modifier.</p><p>Like other spellcasters, a psychic detective can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. She knows the same number of spells and receives the same number of spells slots per day as a bard of her investigator level, and knows and uses 0-level knacks as a bard uses cantrips. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1-3 on page 17 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>).</p><p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a psychic detective can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows, using the same rules as a bard. In effect, the psychic detective loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell the psychic detective can cast.</p><p>A psychic detective need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any psychic detective spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.</p><p><i>Psychic Detective Spells</i>: A psychic detective has the following spells on her spell list, in addition to psychic spells of 6th level or lower.</p><p>1st-<i>Detect chaos</i>, <i>detect evil</i>, <i>detect good</i>, <i>detect law</i>, <i>find traps</i>.</p><p>3rd-<i>Calm spirit</i>*, <i>daylight</i>.</p><p>4th-<i>Modify memory</i>.</p><p>6th-<i>Banishment</i>, <i>moment of prescience</i>, <i>scrying (greater)</i>.</p><p>This ability replaces alchemy.</p><p><b>Psychic Meddler (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, a psychic detective receives a +1 bonus on saves against psychic spells and spell-like abilities. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, to a maximum of +6 at 17th level. Starting at 5th level, the psychic investigator adds half this bonus on caster level checks to dispel psychic effects. This ability replaces poison lore, poison resistance, swift alchemy, and poison immunity.</p><p><b>Phrenic Dabbler (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, a psychic detective gains a small pool of phrenic points equal to 1/2 her psychic detective level, as well as one phrenic amplification, as the psychic class feature. This does not allow the psychic detective to qualify for the Extra Amplification feat. This ability replaces the investigator talent gained at 3rd level.</p><p><b>Investigator Talents</b>: A psychic detective selects investigator talents as normal, except she cannot select the alchemist discovery investigator talent. She can select the Expanded Phrenic Pool* feat as a discovery even though she doesn't meet that feat's prerequisites, and she can select an extra phrenic amplification once as a discovery. The following investigator talents, which can be found on pages 32-34 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide</i>, complement the psychic detective archetype: confusing strike, device talent, effortless aid, hidden agendas, inspired intelligence, item lore, and unconventional inspiration. This ability alters investigator talents.</p><h1>ESOTERIC (MAGUS ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Esoterics are drawn to the mysticism of the occult and spend their lives delving into forgotten texts and forbidden tomes. Each esoteric learns to inscribe his spells on his flesh in a complex series of occult symbols and arcane equations.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: An esoteric is proficient with simple weapons only. This alters the magus's weapon and armor proficiency.</p><p><b>Diminished Spellcasting</b>: An esoteric has one fewer spell slot of each level than a regular magus. If this reduces his number of spell slots of a particular level to zero, he can cast spells of that level only if his Intelligence allows bonus spells of that level. This ability alters the magus's spellcasting.</p><p><b>Arcane Pool (Su)</b>: At 1st level, an esoteric can use his arcane pool to enhance his unarmed strikes as if they were manufactured weapons. At 5th level, he can use these bonuses to add any of the following weapon special abilities to his weapons or unarmed strikes: <i>defending</i>, f<i>laming</i>, f<i>laming burst</i>, <i>frost</i>, <i>icy burst</i>, <i>impact</i>(UM), <i>shock</i>, <i>shocking burst</i>, <i>speed</i>, or <i>thundering</i>. This ability alters arcane pool.</p><p><b>Unarmed Strike</b>: At 1st level, an esoteric gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. He also treats his magus levels as monk levels when determining the amount of damage he deals with his unarmed strikes.</p><p><b>Unarmed Spellstrike (Su)</b>: At 1st level, an esoteric gains the magus spellstrike class feature. However, an esoteric can deliver spells with spellstrike only with his unarmed strikes. This ability alters spellstrike.</p><p><b>Ki Arcana (Su)</b>: At 4th level, an esoteric's arcane pool is also considered a ki pool for the purposes of meeting feat and ability requirements. Points from an esoteric's arcane pool can be used for abilities that normally require ki. If an esoteric gains a ki pool, he can use points from his arcane pool and ki pool interchangeably (though not special points such as drunken ki). This ability replaces spell recall.</p><p><b>Tattooed Spell (Sp)</b>: At 5th level and every 6 levels thereafter, an esoteric can permanently tattoo one spell from his magus spellbook onto his body; the first tattooed spell must be of 2nd level or lower, the second must be of 4th level or lower, and the last can be of any level. The spell that is tattooed must not have an expensive material component or a focus. The esoteric can prepare any tattooed spell without needing his spellbook. Additionally, he can cast each of his tattooed spells as a spell-like ability once per day. When the esoteric uses these spell-like abilities, the tattoo associated with the spell-like ability glows as <i>light </i>for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level. This ability replaces bonus feats.</p><p><b>AC Bonus (Ex)</b>: At 7th level when an esoteric wears light or no armor, he gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and CMD. This bonus increases by 1 at 13th level. He loses these bonuses while immobilized or helpless, or while wearing medium or heavy armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load. This ability replaces medium armor and heavy armor.</p><p><b>Improved Tattooed Spell (Sp)</b>: At 11th level, an esoteric can use each of his spell-like abilities from tattooed spell one additional time per day. This ability replaces improved spell recall.</p><h1>MINDBLADE (MAGUS ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>A mindblade blends psychic talent and martial skill to lethal effect. By forming weapons with her mind, she always has the right tool for any situation.</p><p><b>Spells</b>: A mindblade casts spells from the magus spell list as psychic spells. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mindblade must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell's level. The saving throw DC to resist a mindblade's spell is equal to 10 + the spell's level + the mindblade's Intelligence modifier.</p><p>Like other spellcasters, a mindblade can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. She knows the same number of spells and receives the same number of spells slots per day as a bard of her magus level, and knows and uses 0-level knacks as a bard uses cantrips. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1-3 on page 17 of the <i>Core Rulebook</i>).</p><p>At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mindblade can learn a new spell in place of one she already knows, using the same rules as a bard. In effect, the mindblade loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and the new spell must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell the mindblade can cast.</p><p>A mindblade need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any magus spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.</p><p>This ability replaces the magus's spellcasting.</p><p><b>Psychic Pool (Su)</b>: A mindblade gains a psychic pool, similar to a normal magus's arcane pool. At 1st level, a mindblade can expend 1 point from her psychic pool as a standard action to manifest a light melee weapon of her choice, formed from psychic energy. By spending 2 points, the mindblade can manifest a one-handed melee weapon, and by spending 3 points, she can manifest a two-handed melee weapon (but not a double weapon). This psychic weapon can last indefinitely, but it vanishes if it leaves the mindblade's hand. The mindblade can dismiss a held psychic weapon as a free action. When a psychic weapon vanishes, the mindblade regains the psychic energy used to create it. She can maintain only one weapon at a time.</p><p>At 1st level, a psychic weapon counts as a magic weapon of whatever type the mindblade selected, with a +1 enhancement bonus. At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, the weapon's enhancement bonus increases by 1, up to maximum of +5 at 12th level. Starting at 5th level, the mindblade can add any of the weapon special abilities listed in the arcane pool class feature in place of these bonuses, although the weapon must maintain at least a +1 bonus to benefit from any weapon special abilities. At 15th and 18th levels, the weapon gains an additional +1 enhancement bonus, which the mindblade can spend only on weapon special abilities.</p><p>This ability replaces arcane pool, and counts as arcane pool for the purpose of feats, abilities, and class features.</p><p><b>Psychic Access (Su)</b>: At 4th level, the mindblade gains access to an expanded spell list. She adds two spells from the psychic class spell list to her magus spell list as magus spells of the same spell level. These must be spells of levels the mindblade is able to cast. At 7th, 11th, 14th, and 19th levels, she adds two more psychic class spells to her spell list, following the same restrictions. When a mindblade takes the spell blending arcana, she gains spells from the psychic class spell list instead of the wizard spell list.</p><p>This ability replaces spell recall, knowledge pool, improved spell recall, greater spell combat, and greater spell access.</p><p><b>Dual Weapons (Su)</b>: At 7th level, a mindblade can maintain two psychic weapons at a time or a psychic double weapon, though each weapon (or each end of a double weapon) has an enhancement bonus 1 lower than normal. Starting at 12th level, each of the two psychic weapons (or each end of a double weapon) instead has an enhancement bonus 2 lower than normal. When using two-weapon fighting with two psychic weapons or a psychic double weapon, the mindblade can use her spell combat ability as though she had a hand free. This ability replaces medium armor.</p><p><b>Rapid Manifest (Su)</b>: At 8th level, a mindblade can manifest a psychic weapon as a swift action. This ability replaces improved spell combat.</p><p><b>Dual Manifest (Su)</b>: At 13th level, a mindblade can manifest two psychic weapons with the same action. She must pay the cost for both weapons. Also, when wielding a weapon two-handed, she can use her spell combat ability as though she had a hand free. This ability replaces heavy armor.</p><h1>KARMIC MONK (MONK ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>A karmic monk contemplates the myriad harmonies that guide existence. He learns to use the disharmony in others against them, and to alter his own inner harmonies to exploit weaknesses in his opponents' defenses.</p><p><b>Alignment</b>: A karmic monk must be true neutral or of any lawful alignment. This alters the monk's alignment requirement.</p><p><b>Class Skills</b>: The karmic monk gains Diplomacy (Cha) as a class skill instead of Intimidate. This alters the monk's class skills.</p><p><b>Karmic Strike (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a karmic monk gains bonuses against creatures that attack him first. If a creature the karmic monk has not attacked within the past 24 hours makes an attack roll against the karmic monk or casts an offensive spell that affects the karmic monk, the karmic monk receives a +2 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against that creature. If the karmic monk hits such a target, this bonus lasts until the end of the karmic monk's turn (or until the beginning of the karmic monk's next turn, if it isn't his turn). Otherwise, the bonus against a particular creature lasts for 1 minute after the creature's last attack against the karmic monk. This ability replaces stunning fist.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Balanced Mind (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, a karmic monk receives a +2 bonus on saving throws against effects with the chaos, evil, good, or law subtype. He also receives this bonus against the abilities and effects of creatures of the listed subtypes. This ability replaces still mind.</p><p><b>Ki Pool (Su)</b>: At 7th level, when a karmic monk makes unarmed strikes, they're treated as chaotic, evil, good, and lawful. This ability replaces the 7th- and 10th-level ki pool abilities.</p><p><b>Harmony (Su)</b>: At 9th level, as an immediate action, a karmic monk can shift his alignment by one step for the purpose of all effects dependent on alignment until the beginning of his next turn. This does not actually alter the karmic monk's alignment. This ability replaces improved evasion.</p><p><b>Karmic Disruption (Su)</b>: At 16th level, a karmic monk can spend 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action to add 1d6 points of damage to his unarmed strikes against creatures of either chaotic, evil, good, or lawful alignment for 1 round. This stacks with other abilities that deal damage based on alignment. He cannot alter his alignment choice until the next time he uses this ability. Creatures that are of the appropriate alignment and are struck by this attack must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the karmic monk's class level + the karmic monk's Wisdom modifier) or lose any damage reduction based on alignment for a number of rounds equal to the karmic monk's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 round). A creature that succeeds at this save is immune to having its damage reduction disrupted by that karmic monk for 24 hours. This attack disrupts only alignment components of damage reduction, not any other components; for example, DR/cold iron and good becomes DR/cold iron.</p><p>This ability replaces slow fall 80 feet, and alters slow fall at 19th level to become slow fall 80 feet.</p><p><b>Harmonic Self</b>: At 20th level, a karmic monk is truly in tune with the harmonic balance of the universe. He gains the abilities of perfect self, except that instead of DR 10/chaotic, he gains DR 10 that is overcome only by attacks that do not count as chaotic, evil, good, or lawful. This ability alters perfect self.</p><h1>GHOST HUNTER (PALADIN ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Ghost hunters devote their lives to eliminating malevolent spirits and putting them to rest.</p><p><b>Ghostly Smite (Su)</b>: A ghost hunter's smite evil ability does not automatically bypass DR (other than DR/good). However, she treats her weapon as a <i>ghost touch </i>weapon against the target of her smite. She does not deal extra damage on the first attack against evil outsiders and evil dragons, but she deals 3 points of damage per paladin level she possesses to undead creatures on the first attack (instead of 2 points). This ability alters smite evil.</p><p><b>Exorcise Possession (Su)</b>: At 6th level, a ghost hunter can try to end any possession spells or effects, or effects that directly exercise mental control over a creature. She must touch the affected creature (this requires a melee touch attack if the target is neither willing nor helpless) and expend a use of her lay on hands ability. The target can immediately attempt a Will save against the original save DC of the controlling effect. If the save is successful, the effect immediately ends, as if the target had succeeded at its original saving throw. This ability replaces the 6th-level mercy.</p><p><b>Speak to the Restless (Sp)</b>: At 9th level, a ghost hunter can commune with the spirits of the restless dead once per day. By holding a seance for 10 minutes, she can ask questions of a destroyed undead or a neutralized or destroyed haunt. To use this ability on a corporeal undead, the ghost hunter must have the creature's head in her possession. For a haunt or incorporeal undead, this seance must be held in the haunt's location or where the incorporeal undead was destroyed. Treat this ability as <i>speak with haunt</i>(ACG) or as <i>speak with dead </i>(but affecting only undead rather than only corpses), using the ghost hunter's class level as the caster level. This ability replaces the 9th-level mercy.</p><h1>ESCAPOLOGIST (ROGUE ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>The escapologist excels at escaping any confinement, whether physical, magical, or mental. Few restraints can hold an escapologist for long.</p><p><b>Elusive</b>: An escapologist adds 1/2 her rogue level (minimum +1) as a bonus on all Disable Device and Escape Artist checks. An escapologist can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps. This ability replaces trapfinding, but counts as trapfinding for the purposes of prerequisites and abilities that require trapfinding.</p><p><b>Unfettered Mind (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, an escapologist can attempt an Escape Artist check as a full-round action to remove a mind-affecting effect currently affecting her. The DC of this check is equal to the effect's original save DC + 20. She cannot remove effects that do not allow a saving throw. She can attempt to escape even if paralyzed or restrained, as long as she can take purely mental actions. She can attempt this check against a particular effect once per round if the effect is measured in rounds, once per minute if the effect is measured in minutes, once per 10 minutes if the effect is measured in 10-minute intervals, and so on. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p><p><b>Impossible Escape (Su)</b>: At 8th level, as an immediate action, an escapologist can attempt an Escape Artist check at a -10 penalty and apply the result in place of either a failed Reflex save or her AC against an attack that would have hit her. If she succeeds, her contortions let her avoid the attack or effect entirely. Using this ability leaves the escapologist staggered until the end of her next turn. If the escapologist can't become staggered, she can't use impossible escape. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p><h1>FALSE MEDIUM (ROGUE ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>The false medium is a master of pretending to have occult powers in order to manipulate the emotions and atmosphere of the people and places around him, often reaping a healthy reward from the bereaved, who find solace in his comforting lies.</p><p><b>Dim the Lights (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, while in dim light or darkness, a false medium adds 1/2 his rogue level as a bonus on Bluff, Disguise, and Sleight of Hand checks, and creatures without low-light vision or darkvision take an equal penalty on skill checks to oppose the false medium's Bluff, Disguise, and Sleight of Hand checks. This ability replaces trapfinding.</p><p><b>False Sensitivity (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, a charlatan can convincingly fake the ability to use occult skill unlocks such as automatic writing and dowsing. An untrained onlooker can't tell the difference between the false medium's scams and a true use of occult skill unlocks. An onlooker capable of using the particular occult skill unlock that the false medium is faking can attempt the appropriate skill check for that unlock, opposed by the false medium's Bluff check, to detect the fraud. In any case, any results of the false medium's charades are fabricated (for instance, the false medium might ask leading questions to elicit false memories while pretending to use hypnotism). This ability replaces the 2nd-level rogue talent.</p><p><b>Haunting Presences (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, the false medium exploits his natural talent for deception to convince others of the presence of false supernatural entities. As long as the false medium is in conditions of dim light or darkness, he can use Bluff skill checks to emulate the effects of <i>dancing lights</i>, <i>ghost sound</i>, <i>silent image</i>, or <i>ventriloquism </i>by throwing his voice, subtly misdirecting or convincing subjects, or manipulating light and shadows. The range of these effects is 10 feet from the false medium, plus an additional 5 feet for every 3 rogue levels he possesses beyond 3rd. The effects last for 1 round, though they can be maintained with additional checks. Only one of these effects can be created or maintained in a given round. Observers can attempt either a Perception or Sense Motive check (whichever of their bonuses is higher) to oppose this Bluff check; the GM should roll these checks secretly. This is an extraordinary ability and not an illusion, so if the false medium succeeds at the opposed check, even powerful effects like <i>true seeing </i>don't detect the fakery.</p><p>This ability replaces trap sense.</p><p><b>Rogue Talents</b>: The following rogue talents complement the false medium rogue archetype: esoteric scholar(UC), fast fingers(APG), honeyed words(APG), major magic, minor magic, and quick trapsmith(APG).</p><p><b>Advanced Talents</b>: The following advanced rogue talents complement the false medium rogue archetype: feat, master of disguise(APG), and skill mastery.</p><h1>ECTOPLASM (SORCERER BLOODLINE)</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Your family has a connection with the ethereal substance known as ectoplasm, whether from communing with the spirits or battling the spiritual undead.

This ectoplasm acts as a tanglefoot bag that can also entangle incorporeal creatures. The ectoplasm dissipates within 1d3 rounds. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p><p><i>Ectoplasmic Reach (Su)</i>: At 3rd level, you can exude small tendrils of ectoplasm that can be used to make melee touch attacks as part of a spell with a range of touch. You can make melee touch attacks as if you had an additional 5 feet of reach. You must have a free hand with which to direct the ectoplasm.</p><p>This ability does not otherwise increase your threatened area. At 11th level, this additional reach increases to 10 feet. At 17th level, this additional reach increases to 15 feet.</p><p><i>Ectoplasmic Form (Sp)</i>: At 9th level, you can transform into a cloud of ectoplasm. Treat this as <i>gaseous form</i>, except that you can fly at a speed of 30 feet, and you can solidify your form sufficiently to carry small objects, though fine manipulation is impossible. You can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to your sorcerer level. These minutes need not be consecutive, but must be used in 1-minute increments.</p><p><i>Malevolent Ectoplasm (Sp)</i>: At 15th level, your ectoplasmic tendrils can lash out at creatures around you. Treat this as a <i>black tentacles </i>effect centered on your position, but the tentacles can also grapple ethereal and incorporeal creatures, and they do not affect you (though they still affect your allies). You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to your sorcerer level. These rounds need not be consecutive.</p><p><i>Ectoplasmic Body (Ex)</i>: At 20th level, you are more ectoplasm than flesh. You become immune to sneak attacks and critical hits and gain DR 5/slashing.</p><h1>PSYCHIC (SORCERER BLOODLINE)</h1><p>Psychic power runs through your blood, whether it be from a familial predisposition to psychic power or exposure to a powerful psychic phenomenon. Whatever the source of this power, your mind is a dangerous weapon.</p><p><b>Class Skill</b>: Sense Motive.</p><p><b>Bonus Spells</b>: <i>Mind thrust I</i>* (3rd), <i>id insinuation I</i>* (5th), <i>ego whip I</i>* (7th), <i>intellect fortress I</i>* (9th), <i>psychic crush I</i>* (11th), <i>mental barrier V</i>* (13th), <i>tower of iron will III</i>* (15th), <i>bilocation</i>* (17th), <i>microcosm</i>* (19th).</p><p><b>Bonus Feats</b>: Focused Spell(APG), Heighten Spell, Intuitive Spell*, Iron Will, Logical Spell*, Persuasive, Quicken Spell, Skill Focus (Sense Motive), Spell Focus.</p><p><b>Bloodline Arcana</b>: Your sorcerer spells and spell-like abilities count as psychic instead of arcane. You use thought and emotion components instead of verbal and somatic components when casting your spells.</p><p><b>Bloodline Powers</b>: Your psychic powers make you a master mentalist, but your soul struggles with the urge to transcend into a pure thought-form.</p><p><i>Psychic Strike (Su)</i>: At 1st level, you can overwhelm the minds of those nearby. You can target one creature within 30 feet that you can see; that creature must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier) or it takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point for every 2 sorcerer levels you possess and becomes shaken for 1 round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p><p><i>Mental Resistance (Ex)</i>: At 3rd level, your mind blocks attempts to assail it. You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. At 9th level, this bonus increases to +4.</p><p><i>Undercasting Prodigy (Sp)</i>: Starting at 9th level, whenever you gain a new level of spells, you automatically replace any psychic bloodline spells that can be undercast with the highest-level version you can cast in your list of spells known. For example, at 9th level, you would replace <i>mind thrust I</i>, <i>id insinuation I</i>, and <i>ego whip I </i>with <i>mind thrust IV</i>, <i>id insinuation III</i>, and <i>ego whip II</i>, respectively, as spells known.</p><p><i>Thoughtsense (Sp)</i>: At 15th level, you can detect the thoughts of others around you, as a constant <i>thoughtsense</i>* effect with a range of 30 feet instead of 60 feet.</p><p><i>True Thought-Form (Sp)</i>: At 20th level, you can shed the restrictions of the flesh and become a thought-form-a being that exists independently of its substance. Whenever a creature would kill you, you can attempt to use <i>mind swap</i>* against that creature as an immediate action just before dying.</p><h1>WITCH PATRONS</h1><p>Some witches draw their spells from mysterious patrons connected to the mind or the Ethereal Plane. Such esoteric patrons grant unusual powers for their own strange and inscrutable reasons.</p><p><b>Ethereal</b>: 2nd-<i>detect undead</i>, 4th-<i>see invisibility</i>, 6th- <i>ectoplasmic snare</i>*, 8th-<i>condensed ether</i>*, 10th-<i>ethereal envelope</i>*, 12th-<i>ethereal jaunt</i>, 14th-<i>ectoplasmic eruption</i>*, 16th-<i>ethereal envelopment</i>*, 18th-<i>etherealness</i>.</p><p><b>Mind</b>: 2nd-<i>mindlink</i>*, 4th-<i>mental block</i>*, 6th- <i>mindscape door</i>*, 8th-<i>create mindscape</i>*, 10th-<i>psychic asylum</i>*, 12th-<i>create mindscape (greater)</i>*, 14th-<i>psychic surgery</i>*, 16th-<i>moment of prescience</i>, 18th-<i>microcosm</i>*.</p><h1>LEY LINE GUARDIAN (WITCH ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Some witches tap into the power of their patrons not through a special connection with a familiar, but rather directly through the vast network of ley lines that crosses the planes. These witches can harness the latent powers of ley lines without even needing to be near one of the points where ley lines' powers are accessible to mortal spellcasters.</p><p><b>Ley Line Powered</b>: Instead of preparing her spells, a ley line guardian draws the power casting spells directly from ley lines. A ley line guardian is a spontaneous spellcaster. She knows the same number of spells and receives the same number of spell slots per day as a sorcerer of her witch level. Bonus spells granted by a ley line guardian's patron are added to the ley line guardian's total spells known at the appropriate levels. This ability alters the witch's spellcasting.</p><p><b>Conduit Surge (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a ley line guardian is adept at channeling energy from ley lines to enhance her own spells. As a swift action, she can increase her effective caster level for the next spell she casts in that round by 1d4-1 levels. After performing a conduit surge, the ley line guardian must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + level of spell cast + number of additional caster levels granted) or become staggered for a number of minutes equal to the level of the spell cast. At 8th level, the caster level increase becomes 1d4. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.</p><p>This ability replaces familiar and the hexes gained at 1st and 8th levels.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypes\">^Archetypes</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"nHl3hvuDyzOh8lk5"}

See pages 159-165 of <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 </i>for more information on kami. <b>Kami Channeler (Su)</b>: A kami medium channels the kami at locations different from where a normal medium channels his spirits. The kami medium channels the dosojin (which acts as the trickster) at crossroads and other major roadway milestones; the fukujin (which acts as the marshal) at ornamental shrubs and bonsai trees; the kaminari (which acts as the champion) in the midst of storms; the suijin (which acts as the hierophant) at pure lakes, ponds, springs, and wells; and the zuishin (which acts as the guardian) at significant gates, doorways, and torii. The kami medium does not have access to the archmage legend. This ability alters spirit.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Natural Taboo (Ex)</b>: A kami medium gains the taboo ability at 1st level. Regardless of which kami he channels, each day he must accept the hierophant taboo to strongly revere nature and avoid metal armor. The kami medium gains two free uses of spirit surge from accepting this taboo, as normal. This ability alters taboo.</p><p><b>Ofuda (Su)</b>: A kami medium uses ofudas-psychically charged prayer scrolls-to focus his spells. Each of his spells gains an ofuda as an additional inexpensive material component, and the ofuda replaces the divine focus for spells the kami medium gains via the divine surge spirit power. Unless the spell involves a touch attack or ranged touch attack, the kami medium doesn't need to attempt an attack roll to place an ofuda on an unwilling target; the ofuda simply appears on affected targets. For instantaneous spells, the ofuda is consumed during the casting, but for spells with any other duration, the ofuda remains on the target or targets throughout the duration and then disintegrates when the duration expires. A kami medium's spells can't be dispelled by <i>dispel magic </i>or <i>greater dispel magic</i>, but removing or destroying the ofuda ends the duration immediately. An ofuda must be displayed prominently and can't be hidden (though a creature bearing an ofuda can hide normally). A successful steal or grapple combat maneuver check to remove an item is sufficient to remove an ofuda from an unwilling target, and a standard action automatically removes it from a willing target. An ofuda counts as an object made of paper with 5 hit points per medium level. The target of the spell can't see, harm, or remove the ofuda attached to her, though her allies can do so. If the spell is harmless, the target can see her ofuda.</p><p>This ability alters the medium's spellcasting.</p><p><b>Shikigami (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, a kami medium learns to fold an origami animal to serve as a temporary ward for a minor shikigami. Initially, the merged minor shikigami can't leave the paper body and acts in all ways as an ordinary animal familiar of the origami animal's type, although it still appears to be made of paper. At 5th level, it gains the abilities of a shikigami improved familiar (<i>Bestiary 3 </i>163), even if the kami medium doesn't meet the prerequisites for having a shikigami as a familiar. The shikigami treats the kami medium as its ward. Additionally, it gains the ability to use change shape to change between its full shikigami form and its origami form at will (as <i>beast shape II</i>).</p><p>This ability replaces haunt channeler, location channel, and connection channel.</p><p><b>Ask the Kami (Su)</b>: At 13th level, a kami medium can ask the local kami for information, as <i>commune with nature</i>. While he can do so any number of times per day, he can ask questions of the kami in any particular area only once per day. Afterward, he must move to a non-overlapping area to use this ability again. This ability replaces ask the spirits.</p><p><b>Ward (Su)</b>: At 14th level, a kami medium can declare an area or object that's an appropriate place to contact his channeled kami as his ward. This grants the kami medium the ward and merge with ward abilities of the kami subtype. For large areas such as lakes or storms, a kami medium's ward encompasses a radius of up to 5 feet per medium level. This ability replaces astral journey.</p><h1>REANIMATED MEDIUM (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Sometimes a departed soul destined for legend gains a second chance at life by possessing his own revived body.</p><p><b>Channel Self (Su)</b>: A reanimated medium is essentially a bodiless spirit using influence to possess his own spiritless body. \"The reanimated medium\" refers to this spirit. Unlike a normal medium, a reanimated medium becomes more powerful the more influence it has over its body. Each day, the reanimated medium can perform a seance at a location as normal to focus on one of his potential future legends. He channels that legendary potential as strongly as possible into his body. The spirit gains 3 points of influence over his body, to a maximum of 6 points. Since he is his own possessing spirit, he doesn't lose control at 5 or more points of influence, though he still suffers the legend's influence penalty as normal at 3 or more points of influence. All effects and abilities that normally increase or decrease influence (such as spirit surge and spirit powers) have the opposite effect on a reanimated medium (for instance, propitiation increases influence by 1 point and spirit surge reduces influence by 1 point); this does not apply to the new abilities from the reanimated medium archetype. A reanimated medium can't choose to channel a weaker spirit to avoid losing influence from using spirit surge. The body of a reanimated medium who reaches 0 points of influence enters a deathlike coma and is helpless for 24 hours, after which the reanimated medium reverts to 1 point of influence if the body is still alive, but can't perform a seance for another 24 hours.</p><p>A character who selects the reanimated medium archetype after 1st level can do so only after dying; at the GM's discretion, a dead character of another class with an intact body who has earned enough experience points to level up can take a level in medium and gain the reanimated medium archetype, and a dead medium might be able to gain this archetype. In any case, being revived from gaining the reanimated medium archetype does not impart any negative levels or other ill effects.</p><p>This ability alters spirit.</p><p><b>Nothing Is Taboo (Ex)</b>: A reanimated medium doesn't gain the taboo class feature.</p><p><b>Ease Passage (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, as long as a reanimated medium's body is intact, it's easy for him to return to it. He takes only 1 negative level instead of 2 from <i>raise dead</i>. This ability replaces haunt channeler.</p><p><b>Lingering Spirit (Su)</b>: At 5th level, a reanimated medium's spirit lingers for up to 1 round after death before departing if the medium spends 1 point of influence. If the reanimated medium died of hit point damage, healing works on his body during the intervening round and can bring him back to life. Once the spirit departs, the <i>breath of life </i>spell continues to work for 1 additional round, even though the reanimated medium has been dead for more than 1 round. This ability replaces location channel.</p><p><b>Spirit Warding (Su)</b>: At 7th level, the reanimated medium can ward himself from other spirits and the grave's call. He gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against possession, death effects, and negative energy. This stacks with the bonus to resist possession that mediums gain from having high influence. At 18th level, he becomes immune to possession, death effects, and negative energy. This ability replaces connection channel and spacious soul.</p><p><b>Living Legend (Su)</b>: At 20th level, the reanimated medium reaches the legendary potential from which he borrowed so long ago and becomes a living embodiment of his legend. Any ally in the reanimated medium's presence can perform a seance to channel the reanimated medium (the seance takes 1 hour and is subject to the other rules for a medium's seance). Each ally can do this only once per day. At the end of the seance, the reanimated medium can choose to reduce his influence by 1 point. If the reanimated medium does so, some of his spirit seeps into that ally, which can then spend that 1 point of influence to use any of the reanimated medium's abilities that decrease influence. This ability replaces astral beacon.</p><h1>RELIC CHANNELER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>A relic channeler carries relics of legend around with her. She need not rely on locating the specific spirits that she seeks, but the relics limit the number of unique spirits she can channel.</p><p><b>Relics (Su)</b>: A relic channeler begins with one relic for each of the six spirit legends. Each relic corresponds to a specific spirit, and could be any type of psychically resonant item-from a runestone with a symbol related to that spirit to a bone remnant from a legendary hero. Once a relic channeler selects a choice for taboos and spirit powers (such as archmage arcana and legendary champion), those choices remain in effect every time she channels that legend; unlike normal mediums, she can't select a different option each time. A relic channeler can't choose to channel a weaker spirit to reduce her influence from spirit surge. She doesn't need to find an appropriate location to channel her spirits, since she can simply use her relics. If she loses one of her relics, she is incapable of channeling that legend until she recovers the relic. If the relic is destroyed, the relic channeler can use her strong bond with the spirit of that relic to forge a new relic for that spirit from her own essence. The process takes 1 week of intense seances and 500 gp per medium level she possesses. This ability alters spirit.</p><p><b>Powerful Bond (Su)</b>: Because of habitually channeling the same spirits and possessing physical links to the spirits' former lives and legends, a relic channeler possesses a strong bond with her spirits. She receives the benefit of the Alertness feat whenever she is suffering a spirit's influence penalty. She chooses two spells of each level with the archmage arcana and divine surge spirit powers instead of one, two exotic weapon proficiencies with champion's prowess instead of one, three combat feats with legendary champion instead of two, and three skills with trickster's edge instead of two. This ability alters spirit.</p><p><b>Object Reading (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, a relic channeler gains the occultist's object reading ability, substituting her medium level for her occultist level for this ability. This ability replaces haunt channeler.</p><p><b>Apport Relic (Su)</b>: At 5th level, a relic channeler can call one of her relics to her once per day as though she had cast <i>apport object</i>* on it and was mentally completing the spell. Furthermore, if the relic channeler gains the <i>apport object </i>spell, she can use it to receive her relics without casting it on them in advance in the same way. The range at which the relic channeler can apport her relics (both with this ability and the spell) increases by an additional 5 feet for every 2 levels she possesses beyond 5th. This ability replaces location channel.</p><p><b>Connection Specialty (Sp)</b>: At 7th level, a relic channeler gains connection channel and can use that ability as a normal medium, despite not possessing location channel. She requires familiarity to use this ability, even if she is in an appropriate location. This ability alters connection channel.</p><h1>SPIRIT DANCER (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>A spirit dancer enacts an exuberant dance to the spirits, accepting many roles in the shifting dance and changing dance partners quickly.</p><p><b>Spirit Dance (Su)</b>: Each day during his seance, a spirit dancer makes all his spirit power choices as if he were channeling one spirit of each of the six legends. He can't choose to channel a weaker spirit to reduce his influence from spirit surge. He does not always possess the seance boon, spirit bonus, spirit powers, or spirit surge ability from any of these six spirits.</p><p>Instead, he can enter a spirit dance as a free action to gain the aforementioned abilities from one of the six spirits he prepared during his seance for the duration of his spirit dance. He can spirit dance for a total number of rounds per day equal to his Charisma modifier + double his medium level; these rounds don't need to be consecutive. After his spirit dance ends, the spirit dancer takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 minute and can't enter a spirit dance again during that time. He also can't enter a spirit dance while shaken, frightened, or panicked. He combines all influence incurred during spirit dances into a single pool. At 3 points of influence or higher, he takes a -2 penalty on initiative checks even when he's not in a spirit dance, and at 5 points of influence or higher, his current spirit takes control as it would for a normal medium (this control is not limited by rounds of spirit dance). A spirit dancer can accept 1 point of influence to recover 4 rounds of spirit dance, up to his normal daily maximum.</p><p>A spirit dancer continues to track daily uses of abilities from each of his spirits even while he is not in a spirit dance. A spirit dancer with the supreme spirit power ability can use only one once-per-day ability from the supreme spirit power each day; he can't use any other spirit's once-per-day supreme spirit power until after his next seance.</p><p>This ability alters spirit and replaces spirit bonus and spirit surge.</p><p><b>Nothing Is Taboo (Ex)</b>: A spirit dancer doesn't gain the taboo class feature.</p><p><b>Spirit Aura (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, a spirit dancer's weaving forms create an aura that grants his current seance boon to all allies within 30 feet. When he grants a seance boon that requires a decision, each ally makes the appropriate decision the first time that ally receives that spirit's aura each day. That decision remains in effect if the ally is affected by that spirit's aura again later that day. This ability replaces shared seance.</p><p><b>Spirit Troika (Su)</b>: At 15th level, a spirit dancer learns to dance with two partners. When using spirit dance, he can choose to spend 3 rounds of spirit dance each round to gain access to the abilities of any two of the six spirits he prepared during his seance for 1 round. This ability replaces trance of three.</p><p><b>Attacca (Su)</b>: At 18th level, a spirit dancer learns how to shift rapidly into the next movement of his dance. He no longer takes a penalty after his spirit dance ends and can enter another spirit dance immediately.</p><p>This ability replaces spacious soul.</p><p><b>Dance of Infinite Forms (Su)</b>: At 20th level, a spirit dancer has perfected his dance. He can now use each of his supreme spirit powers' once-per-day abilities one time each day, instead of just one ability. He can use his spirit troika by spending 2 rounds of spirit dance instead of 3. Finally, he can enter a spirit dance with all six of his prepared spirits at once by spending 4 rounds of spirit dance each round.</p><p>This ability replaces astral beacon.</p><h1>STORYTELLER (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>While all mediums connect to legendary spirits, storyteller mediums take their obsession with legends to the extreme, suffusing their lives with epic tales at the cost of some of their spiritual power.</p><p><b>Diminished Spirits (Ex)</b>: A storyteller does not receive his spirit's seance boon. He can't choose to channel a weaker spirit to reduce his influence from spirit surge. Because of his obsession with legends, he begins with 2 points of influence after a seance rather than 1.</p><p>This ability alters spirit.</p><p><b>Knowledge of Tales (Ex)</b>: A storyteller gains a +1 bonus on all Knowledge skill checks with Knowledge skills in which he's trained. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 medium levels that he possesses.</p><p>This ability replaces spirit bonus.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Versatile Surge (Su)</b>: A storyteller's spirit surge can be used after the storyteller fails any ability check, skill check, or saving throw.</p><p>This ability alters spirit surge.</p><p><b>Storyteller's Performance (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, a storyteller gains the ability to recall snippets of tales that are relevant to the current situation. This ability is similar in all respects to bardic performance as used by a bard of the storyteller's medium level (including interactions with feats, spells, and other abilities), and uses Perform (act), Perform (comedy), or Perform (oratory) as the storyteller's performance skill. However, a storyteller gains only the following types of bardic performance: inspire courage (2nd level), inspire competence (3rd level), inspire greatness (9th level), and inspire heroics (15th level).</p><p>This ability replaces shared seance, taboo, haunt channeler, propitiation, and trance of three.</p><p><b>Learn the Story (Sp)</b>: At 7th level, a storyteller becomes a master at learning a place's tales. He can perform for a full minute, spending 10 rounds of storyteller's performance, to gain the effects of <i>retrocognition</i>*. At 10th level, he can spend 1d4 x 10 minutes and 10 rounds of storyteller's performance to gain the effects of <i>legend lore</i>. The subject must be at hand for the <i>legend lore </i>to function. At 19th level, the storyteller can spend a standard action and 1 round of storyteller's performance to gain the effects of <i>vision </i>on any subject. This ability replaces connection channel and spirit mastery.</p><p><b>Living Story (Sp)</b>: At 20th level, a storyteller gains the ability to sweep others away into a story of his own making. He must perform for 1 full round, telling a tale to set the snare for his living story and spending 1 round of his storyteller's performance. At the end of that round, he can affect up to 30 Hit Dice of listeners within range with <i>microcosm*</i>. Unlike with a normal <i>microcosm</i>, this is also a sonic and language-dependent ability, and a creature with 16 or more Hit Dice that succeeds at its save is immune to the storyteller's living story ability for 24 hours.</p><p>This ability replaces astral beacon.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypes\">^Archetypes</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"qQGzJltnCrPZGKhT"}

You must specify the distance and direction to the location you desire to view remotely. This spell doesn't allow you to see the visual appearance of the location's surface, so it isn't useful for casting spells like <i>teleport</i>, but it grants you a psychic impression of the location, which could give you deeper information. For example, a forest that is home to a tight-knit community of fey might appear as a city in the trees, or a beautiful palace ruled by an evil king and warded by <i>forbiddance </i>might appear as a dark fortress encased in insubstantial chains.</p><p>During the 1 hour casting time of <i>remote viewing, </i>your real body is unconscious and helpless, and you are unaware of its surroundings.</p><h1>Repress Memory</h1><p><b>School </b>Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]; <b>Level </b>Bard 5, Mesmerist 5, Psychic 6</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 round</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S</p><p><b>Range </b>personal</p><p><b>Target </b>you</p><p><b>Duration </b>instantaneous</p><p>This spell allows you to safeguard important knowledge, even from yourself. When casting this spell, you recount one piece of knowledge you possess (up to a maximum of 50 words). This knowledge disappears utterly from your mind, and you might not realize you forgot something. The magic of the spell patches omissions in your memory with indistinct haze.</p><p><i>Repress memory </i>protects against <i>detect thoughts</i>, <i>discern lies</i>, <i>zone of truth</i>, and similar spells, though careful questioning may reveal the gaps in your memory, or that your memory has been affected by the spell.</p><p>A repressed memory can be restored only by <i>break enchantment</i>, <i>psychic surgery</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i>. If you use this spell to negate the memory of a magical compulsion, it doesn't remove the compulsion, nor does it remove procedural memories that might affect your skills or class abilities.</p><p>At the GM's discretion, multiple castings of this spell might erase memories of a lengthier event or all memory of a place or individual from your memory.</p><h1>Retrocognition</h1><p><b>School </b>Divination; <b>Level </b>Medium 3, Occultist 3, Psychic 5, Sorcerer/Wizard 7</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 minute</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S</p><p><b>Range </b>personal</p><p><b>Target </b>you</p><p><b>Duration </b>concentration, up to 1 minute/level</p><p>This spell allows you to gain psychic impressions from past events that occurred in your current location. <i>Retrocognition </i>reveals psychic impressions from events that occurred over the course of the last hour throughout the first minute of the duration, followed by impressions from the next hour back the next minute you concentrate, and so on. If a psychically traumatic or turbulent event happened during that time period, you must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20, 30, or 40, depending on the severity of the psychic disturbance) or lose concentration on the spell.</p><p>At caster level 13th and higher, you can choose to collect impressions from over the course of a longer interval of time than an hour, beginning at 1 week per minute of concentration (as listed on the table below). The amount of detail you receive diminishes, so this eventually makes it harder to distinguish impressions left by anything but the most major events.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Caster Level</b></td><td><b>Time Period</b></td></tr><tr><td>13th-15th</td><td>1 week per minute</td></tr><tr><td>16th-18th</td><td>1 year per minute</td></tr><tr><td>19th+</td><td>1 century per minute</td></tr></table></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Riding Possession</h1></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>School </b>Necromancy; <b>Level </b>Medium 2, Mesmerist 4, Occultist 3, Psychic 4, Sorcerer/Wizard 4, Spiritualist 3, Summoner 4, Witch 4</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>V, S</p><p><b>Range </b>medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p><p><b>Target </b>one creature</p><p><b>Duration </b>1 hour/level (D); see text</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p><p>You stealthily project your soul into the host's body as an observer, with limited ability to influence the target.

You can't communicate with the host directly, but you can cast mind-affecting spells or <i>riding possession </i>on the host as long as you can cast these spells as purely mental actions. Even if the spell you cast would normally affect more than one target or an area, it can affect only the host. If the host succeeds at a saving throw against a spell that you cast in this way, it immediately becomes aware that it is possessed, and if it was already aware, it receives another saving throw against <i>riding possession</i>. <i>Protection from evil </i>and similar effects don't expel you from the host, but they do prevent you from casting further spells from within your host until their durations expire.</p><h1>Sealed Life</h1><p><b>School </b>Abjuration; <b>Level </b>Medium 2, Spiritualist 3</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>S</p><p><b>Range </b>close (25 ft. +5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><b>Target </b>one creature</p><p><b>Duration </b>1 round/level</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p><p>You seal the life force within the target, preventing it from sharing its vitality with others.

Your <i>shadow body </i>is incorporeal for most purposes, though you can't fly or pass through solid objects or creatures.

You can deliver touch spells and effects as if making an incorporeal touch attack.

The plane can be oriented in any fashion and need not be anchored, but must be created continuous and unbroken. The wall can't include squares that have creatures within them, even if the creatures are on the Ethereal Plane. The wall exists on both the Material Plane and Ethereal Plane, and blocks ethereal and incorporeal creatures from passing through it.</p><p>One side of the wall, selected by you, radiates a deeply foreboding and menacing aura from the writhing spirits within.

This doorway takes on any form of your choosing, but can be no larger than a 5-foot cube. This spell has different effects depending on whether you are inside a mindscape when you cast it.</p><p>When you cast this spell outside a mindscape, the doorway connects to one mindscape inhabited by a creature of your choice within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 levels) of the door. That creature becomes the door's conduit, but can attempt a Will save to deny access to the mindscape. You must be aware of the mindscape to connect a <i>mindscape door </i>to it. If you connect to the mindscape, you designate any number of creatures to be able to see and pass through the door as though it were a normal doorway. You can name specific creatures or categories of creatures, or allow all creatures access. Creatures other than those you designate can't perceive or use the door, nor can mindless creatures or those immune to mind-affecting effects. Once anyone enters the mindscape through the door, a duplicate of the door appears inside the mindscape next to the creature you used as a conduit. Anyone inside a mindscape is able to perceive and use a <i>mindscape door </i>within that mindscape. Anyone who enters is subject to all rules of the mindscape, but is aware she is in a mindscape if you informed her where the portal leads.</p><p>When you cast this spell inside a mindscape, a duplicate of the door appears next to your body in the real world. The creator of the mindscape can attempt a Will saving throw to prevent you from creating the door if she is within the mindscape. The two doors operate as if you'd cast the spell outside a mindscape. You still designate who can use the door from the real world to get into the mindscape, but you can't prevent creatures within the mindscape from exiting to the real world.</p><p>Typically, a <i>mindscape door </i>operates in both directions, but you can create it as a one-way door if you so choose. Unlike with other spells, you can cast this spell as a full-round action while engaged in a psychic duel. This spell can be used to exit a binary mindscape, but not to enter one. If you successfully cast <i>mindscape door </i>within a veiled mindscape, you learn that you are in a mindscape, but other creatures observing the door don't automatically realize they are.</p><h1>Mindwipe</h1><p><b>School </b>Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]; <b>Level </b>Medium 4, Mesmerist 4, Occultist 4, Psychic 4, Sorcerer/Wizard 4, Spiritualist 4</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>V</p><p><b>Range </b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><b>Target </b>one creature</p><p><b>Duration </b>instantaneous; see text</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p><p>You erase a portion of the target's mind and experiences, inflicting 2 temporary negative levels on the target for 1 day per caster level. If the target is a spellcaster who must choose and prepare spells in advance, each negative level imposed by <i>mindwipe </i>also causes the target to lose one prepared spell from her highest level of spells known for each of her spellcasting classes for which she must prepare spells. These lost spells are no longer considered known by the target until the corresponding negative levels are removed.</p><p>If the target is a spontaneous spellcaster, each negative level inflicted by <i>mindwipe </i>causes her to lose one spell slot of her highest level of spells for each spontaneous spellcasting class in which she has levels and to lose knowledge of one random spell known of that level (or the next lowest level if she has already lost knowledge of all spells known of that level, and so on). The target cannot use the lost spell slots and spells known as long as the corresponding negative levels last. When the target loses a spell known, the spell remains on her class list but she cannot prepare or cast the spell.</p><p>If the negative levels from <i>mindwipe </i>cause the target's total number of negative levels to equal or exceed her character level, instead of dying, she enters a catatonic state as long as the negative levels from <i>mindwipe </i>continue to cause her total number of negative levels to equal or exceed her character level.</p><h1>Node Of Blasting</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>School </b>Abjuration [Mind-Affecting]; <b>Level </b>Medium 3, Mesmerist 3, Occultist 2, Psychic 3</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>V</p><p><b>Range </b>touch</p><p><b>Target </b>one touched object weighing no more than 10 lbs.</p><p><b>Duration </b>permanent until discharged (D)</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will partial; see text; <b>Spell Resistance </b>no</p><p>You imbue an object with psychic energy.

For example, if you were poisoned, you could use your swift action to cast <i>psychic asylum, </i>pray and meditate for the full 15 minutes to gain <i>neutralize poison, </i>then emerge from the mindscape and immediately cast the spell upon yourself as your standard action.</p><p>Any mind-affecting spell that was affecting you before you cast the spell continues to expend its duration on you while you are within the <i>psychic asylum,</i> so you can use this spell to wait out the effects of such a condition. Effects that are currently affecting your body do not expend additional duration while you are in the <i>psychic asylum,</i> but you also don't experience their effects during the time spent there.</p><h1>Psychic Crush I</h1><p><b>School </b>Necromancy [Mind-Affecting]; <b>Level </b>Psychic 5</p><p><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</p><p><b>Components </b>S</p><p><b>Range </b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><b>Target </b>one creature</p><p><b>Duration </b>instantaneous</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will partial and Fortitude partial; see text; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p><p>Using your psychic power, you invade the mind of the target and tear it asunder, causing massive internal damage to both its mind and body.

If the target fails its Will save, it must attempt a Fortitude save (with a +4 circumstance bonus on this save if it has more than half its total hit points remaining). If it also fails the Fortitude save, the target is reduced to -1 hit points and is dying. If the target succeeds at its Fortitude save, it instead takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point of damage per caster level, which cannot reduce the target below -1 hit point, and the target is sickened for 1 round.

The target does not receive any saving throw bonus because of its hit points. If it is at fewer than half its total hit points, it doesn't gain a Fortitude save to resist this spell but instead proceeds as if it had automatically failed its Fortitude save.

Some psychics find their powers cause physical changes to their own bodies, bring wholly mental phenomena into the real world, or make their own minds mysterious and unknowable even to themselves.</p><h1>AMNESIAC (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>The amnesiac once possessed great psychic power, but mental blocks-resulting from either a traumatic event or intentional implantation-have caused her to forget what she knew before. The amnesiac's struggle to control her psychic magic leads to wild and unpredictable results.</p><p><b>Repressed Memories</b>: All the amnesiac's older memories have been deeply hidden, as though she had been affected by multiple <i>repress memory* </i>spells. She isn't prevented from remembering things that happen over the course of a game, but might be forgetful. If the amnesiac's memories are ever restored, she loses this archetype and reverts to a standard psychic.</p><p><b>Spells</b>: An amnesiac's ability to cast psychic spells is the same as that of the psychic class, with the following exceptions.</p><p>An amnesiac's faulty memory makes remembering and casting spells difficult, but the increased flexibility can be a great benefit. Instead of choosing a number of spells known from Table 1-8: Psychic Spells Known, an amnesiac accesses spells she knew the previous day from the recesses of her mind. This requires 1 hour of meditation. Each day, for each spell level the amnesiac can cast, she retains a number of spells known equal to half the number listed on Table 1-8, rounded up. These spells must be selected from spells the amnesiac knew the previous day (including any spells she remembered using spell recollection; see below). The remainder of her spells known (half the number on Table 1-8, rounded down) become amnesia slots, which the amnesiac can use with her spell recollection ability (see below). To determine the spells she knows on the day when she first takes this archetype, the amnesiac picks any one 1st-level spell from the psychic spell list.</p><p>This change to spells doesn't apply to knacks (0-level spells) or discipline spells, which function the same way they do for a normal psychic. When the amnesiac gains access to 3rd-level spells, she gains full recall of her 1st-level spells and no longer gains 1st-level amnesia slots, instead gaining the full number of 1st-level spells known from Table 1-8 and casting them as a normal psychic. When this happens, the amnesiac can select any level-appropriate spells from the psychic spell list as her spells known, even if they were never among the spells she prepared or recalled; once selected, these spells can no longer be changed, as with a normal psychic. Each time the psychic gains access to a new level of spells, she gains full memory of spells 2 levels lower in the same way (gaining full memory and permanently selecting her 2nd-level spells when she gains access to 4th-level spells, and so on). This ability alters spellcasting.</p><p><b>Spell Recollection (Ex)</b>: Once per hour as a swift action, an amnesiac can attempt to remember any spell from the psychic spell list of her choice from either of the 2 highest spell levels she can cast. When she does, she rolls on Table 2-1: Spell Recollection to determine the result. Because the mental stress of combat brings memories to the surface more easily, the amnesiac adds 1d10 to this roll's result if she's in combat when she attempts to recall a spell. Regardless of the result, the amnesiac expends an amnesia slot of the appropriate level for the spell she is attempting to remember; she must cast the spell remembered (if any) using that amnesia slot during the same round, or the spell slot is lost without effect. Once a spell has been remembered in this way, the amnesiac can cast it as one of her spells known for the rest of the day (even if she failed to cast the spell during the round in which she remembered it), unless spell recollection allowed her to cast a spell of a higher level than she would normally be able to cast.</p><h1>FORMLESS ADEPT (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Formless adepts master their psychic powers to unshackle themselves from the confines of the flesh and empower their spellcasting. They learn to assume increasingly insubstantial forms until they become like living ghosts.</p><p><b>Phrenic Charisma</b>: A formless adept uses his Charisma modifier to determine the number of points in his phrenic pool. This ability alters phrenic pool.</p><p><b>Formless Body</b>: A formless adept gradually sheds his body, taking on increasingly nebulous forms. A formless adept can assume a formless body as a standard action. He can remain in each formless body type for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. The rounds don't have to be used consecutively, but must be used in 1-round increments.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Resuming his physical form takes another standard action; otherwise, the formless adept continues spending rounds of formless body until he runs out of them. The formless adept must return to his physical form before assuming a different formless body.</p><p><i>Blurred Body (Su)</i>: At 1st level, a formless adept can act under the effect of a <i>blur </i>spell. At 5th level, the formless adept can use this ability for a number of minutes per day instead of rounds per day. These minutes don't have to be used consecutively, but must be used in 1-minute increments.</p><p><i>Gaseous Body (Su)</i>: At 5th level, a formless adept can become gaseous as <i>gaseous form. </i>At 13th level, the formless adept can use this ability for a number of minutes per day instead of rounds per day. These minutes don't have to be used consecutively, but must be used in 1-minute increments.</p><p><i>Incorporeal Body (Su)</i>: At 13th level, a formless adept can become incorporeal (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>301).</p><p>This ability replaces the psychic discipline and discipline powers class features.</p><p><b>Formless Spell</b>: At 1st level, a formless adept gains the formless spell phrenic amplification. He can spend 1 point from his phrenic pool to cast a spell with a standard-action casting time as part of the action he uses to assume his formless body, expending the spell slot as normal. This ability replaces the 1st-level phrenic amplification.</p><p><b>Bonus Spells</b>: The formless adept adds extra spells to his list of spells known while he's in a formless body (including when he uses the formless spell phrenic amplification). Spells with a duration last for their full duration, even if the psychic reverts to his physical form. For feats and other abilities that require these spells as prerequisites, the psychic counts as knowing the spells but can benefit from the feats and abilities only while in a formless body. The formless adept gains the following spells at the appropriate levels: <i>chill touch </i>and <i>expeditious retreat </i>(1st), <i>levitate </i>and <i>stricken heart</i>(ACG) (4th), <i>gaseous form </i>and <i>vampiric touch </i>(6th), <i>shadow step</i>(UM) and <i>telekinesis </i>(8th), <i>dominate person </i>and <i>synapse overload</i>* (10th), <i>disintegrate </i>and <i>enemy hammer</i>(APG) (12th), <i>finger of death </i>and <i>telekinetic sphere </i>(14th), <i>etherealness </i>and <i>power word stun </i>(16th), and <i>dominate monster </i>and <i>telekinetic storm</i>* (18th). This ability replaces discipline spells.</p><p><b>Psychic Possession (Su)</b>: At 15th level, while using his incorporeal body ability, a formless adept can attempt to psychically possess another living creature. To use this ability, the formless adept must be adjacent to the target. This effect works as the <i>greater possession</i>* spell and can be maintained only as long as the formless adept maintains his incorporeal body form. The target can attempt a Will save with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the formless adept's class level + the formless adept's Intelligence modifier to resist the effect. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the formless adept's psychic possession for 24 hours. This ability replaces the 15th-level phrenic amplification.</p><p><b>Formless Master (Su)</b>: At 20th level, a formless adept can assume any formless body as a swift action and change between formless body types as a standard action (without returning to his physical form first). He can use the formless spell phrenic amplification to cast any spell with a swift-action casting time when assuming a formless body or any spell with a standard-action casting time while switching between formless bodies. The formless adept also adds his Charisma bonus as a deflection bonus to his AC while in a formless body. A formless adept can attempt a saving throw to bypass any spells that prevent entry of incorporeal creatures (such as <i>anti-incorporeal shell(</i>ACG), even if the spells don't normally allow one. This ability replaces remade self.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Table 2-1: Spell Recollection</h1><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>d%</b></td><td><b>Result</b></td></tr><tr><td>1-10</td><td>The amnesiac is unable to cast spells this round.</td></tr><tr><td>11-35</td><td>The amnesiac can't remember the new spell (but can still cast spells this round).</td></tr><tr><td>36-95</td><td>The amnesiac remembers and can cast the new spell.</td></tr><tr><td>96+</td><td>The amnesiac can choose to treat this result as 36-95.

When a mutation mind uses her psychic abilities, her physical body changes under the stress, and she risks losing control if she pushes too far.</p><p><b>Physical Mutation (Su)</b>: A mutation mind's psychic powers warp her body, allowing her to physically mutate herself as a swift action, which grants her a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and a -2 penalty to Intelligence. At 12th level, the bonus to Strength increases to +6. A mutation mind can assume her physically mutated form for a number of minutes per day equal to her psychic level. The minutes don't have to be used consecutively, but must be used in 1-minute increments.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>When the duration runs out, the mutation mind can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to extend the duration by 1 round. She can continue extending it in this way until she runs out of points. After the mutation ends, the mutation mind is fatigued and can't activate a physical mutation again for 1 round. Turning back to normal before the end of a 1-minute increment takes a standard action. This ability replaces the 1st-level phrenic amplification.</p><p><b>Bodily Mutations</b>: Starting at 3rd level, whenever a mutation mind gains a phrenic amplification, she can select either a phrenic amplification or a bodily mutation. A bodily mutation grants its benefit only when the mutation mind is affected by her physical mutation. Each time she activates her physical mutation, she can activate any number of bodily mutations she possesses.</p><p><i>Adhesive (Ex)</i>: The mutation mind's skin becomes sticky, granting her a +4 bonus on disarm and grapple combat maneuver checks.</p><p><i>Bite Attack (Ex)</i>: The mutation mind's mouth fills with sharp teeth, allowing her to make a bite attack as part of a full-attack action at her highest base attack bonus. This attack deals 1d4 points of damage (1d3 if Small) and counts as a primary attack unless combined with manufactured weapon attacks, as normal.</p><p><i>Bulging Eyes (Ex)</i>: The mutation mind's eyes grow large and round, granting her darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p><p><i>Claws (Ex)</i>: The mutation mind's hands turn into claws, allowing her to make two claw attacks as a full-attack action at her highest base attack bonus. Each of these attacks deals 1d4 points of damage (1d3 if Small) and counts as a primary attack unless combined with manufactured weapon attacks, as normal.</p><p><i>Elongated Fingers (Ex)</i>: The mutation mind's fingers grow long and supple, increasing her reach by 5 feet when she's making melee touch attacks.</p><p><i>Elongated Legs (Ex)</i>: The mutation mind's legs become long and spindly, increasing her base movement by 10 feet.</p><p><i>Energy Resistance (Ex)</i>: The mutation mind's body changes in color and texture, and gains energy resistance 5 to one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), chosen when this mutation is selected. This mutation can be selected multiple times. Each time it is selected, the mutation mind either chooses an additional energy type to gain energy resistance 5 against or increases the resistance granted to one existing type by 5.</p><p><i>Enlarged Torso (Ex)</i>: The mutation mind's torso enlarges disproportionately with the rest of her body, granting her a +2 natural armor bonus to AC.</p><p><i>Rubbery (Ex)</i>: The mutation mind's body becomes soft and rubbery, granting her DR 2/-.</p><p><i>Slimy (Ex)</i>: The mutation mind exudes a thin layer of oily slime over her body, granting her a +4 bonus to CMD.</p><p>This ability alters phrenic amplifications.</p><p><b>Phrenic Empowerment (Su)</b>: At 7th level, a mutation mind's phrenic amplifications empower her physical mutation. Whenever a mutation mind modifies a spell with a phrenic amplification while affected by her physical mutation, she can increase the bonus to her Strength score from her physical mutation by 2 for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell she cast. This bonus doesn't stack; if the mutation mind activates it again, she uses the longer duration but doesn't increase the bonus.</p><p>While under the effect of phrenic empowerment, whenever the mutation mind takes damage, she risks losing control of her powers. At the end of each turn that she takes hit point damage, the mutation mind must succeed at a Will save (DC = 15 + 1/2 her character level) or take a -2 penalty on Will saving throws and to Intelligence. These penalties last for 1 hour after the physical mutation ends and stack with themselves. If the penalty lowers her Intelligence score to 0, the mutation mind is comatose until 1 hour after physical mutation ends.</p><p><b>Improved Bodily Mutations</b>: At 11th level, a mutation mind can select one of the following improved bodily mutations instead of a phrenic amplification.</p><p><i>Aquatic Form (Ex)</i>: The mutation mind's legs fuse into a tail and fins to sprout from her back and side, granting her a swim speed of 30 feet, tremorsense with a range of 30 feet (affecting other creatures in contact with the same body of water), and the aquatic subtype. Her base land speed is reduced to 10 feet.</p><p><i>Enlarged Body (Ex)</i>: The mutation mind's body swells and stretches, enlarging her as the <i>enlarge person </i>spell but up to two size categories larger (maximum Huge).</p><p><i>Multiple Eyes (Ex)</i>: Multiple eyes erupt all over the mutation mind's body. She can't be flanked and gains a +4 bonus on Perception checks.</p><p><i>Recuperation (Ex)</i>: The mutation mind heals quickly from physical wounds, gaining fast healing 5.</p><p><i>Toppling Fists (Ex)</i>: The mutation mind's fists become large masses of flesh, allowing her to attempt a bull rush combat maneuver check against one creature within 10 feet of her as a standard action.</p><p><i>Wings (Ex)</i>: The mutation mind sprouts a pair of fleshy, batlike wings, giving her a fly speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability.</p><p>This ability alters major amplifications.</p><h1>PSYCHIC DUELIST (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Psychic duelists hone their mental powers for combat, much as warriors do with their blades. They specialize in psychic duels, perfecting their thought-form creatures into mighty weapons.</p><p><b>Psychic Duel Acumen (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, a psychic duelist adds <i>instigate psychic duel</i>* to her list of spells known, and the save DC of any <i>instigate psychic duel </i>spell she casts increases by 1. Beginning at 6th level, she can also expend any unused psychic spell slot of 3rd level or higher to cast <i>instigate psychic duel</i>. If she does so, she uses the level of the spell slot expended to determine the Will save DC. In addition, when the psychic duelist sacrifices points from her phrenic pool to generate manifestation points for an offensive manifestation, she uses d8s for damage dice instead of d4s. This ability replaces the 4th-level discipline spell.</p><p><b>Manifestation Amplifications</b>: At 7th level, a psychic duelist gains a manifestation amplification instead of a phrenic amplification; thereafter, whenever the psychic duelist gains a phrenic amplification, she can select either a phrenic amplification or a manifestation amplification. A manifestation amplification functions for a manifestation as a phrenic amplification does for a spell, with the same restrictions. The manifestation being amplified is called the linked manifestation. Phrenic pool points spent toward manifestation amplifications are separate from points sacrificed to generate manifestation points. For example, a psychic duelist capable of casting 4th-level spells (with a maximum of 4 MP per manifestation) could turn 4 points from her phrenic pool into MP and spend 2 points on a manifestation amplification, expending a total of 6 points from her phrenic pool.</p><p><i>Extended Effect (Ex)</i>: The psychic duelist can spend points from her phrenic pool to increase the duration of a condition by 1 round per point spent. She can spend a maximum of 1 phrenic pool point in this way; this maximum increases to 2 points at 11th level, to 3 points at 15th level, and to 4 points at 19th level. If the target succeeds at its saving throw, this amplification has no effect (though the points are still lost). This amplification can be linked only to offensive manifestations that impose conditions.</p><p><i>Faithful Creature (Ex)</i>: When she manifests a thought-form creature, the psychic duelist can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to give that creature the ability to persist even if it doesn't attack. She can concentrate to maintain the creature as a swift action instead of as a full-round action, but the creature can attack only if the psychic duelist concentrates as a full-round action. In addition, the psychic backlash damage from that thought-form creature is halved. This amplification can be linked only to thought-form creature manifestations.</p><p><i>Punishing Thought-form (Ex)</i>: The psychic duelist can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to increase the damage die size of an offensive manifestation by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, or d8 to d10). This amplification can be linked only to offensive manifestations.</p><p><i>Reciprocal Defense (Su): </i>The psychic duelist can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool when using a defensive manifestation to improve her defenses in the real world as well. Her physical body gains a +2 insight bonus to AC for the number of rounds the defensive manifestation lasts, or for 1 round if the manifestation doesn't have a duration. This bonus increases to +3 at 11th level and to +4 at 15th level. This amplification can be linked only to defensive manifestations.</p><p>This ability replaces the 7th-level phrenic amplification and alters phrenic amplifications.</p><p><b>Thought Made Real (Su)</b>: At 9th level, a psychic duelist can bring offensive manifestations directly into her foes' minds, attacking with them without entering a psychic duel. When doing so, she can generate manifestation points only by sacrificing a spell, not through any other methods. Using an offensive manifestation in this way functions as casting a spell with a full-round-action casting time. Conditions imposed by these offensive manifestations last for their full duration, even though the target isn't in a psychic duel. The psychic duelist can use manifestation amplifications on offensive manifestations created this way. Such offensive manifestations can't affect thought-form creatures. This is a mind-affecting illusion (phantasm) effect. A thought-form creature manifested in this way is visible only to its target. This ability replaces <i>telepathic bond</i>.</p><p><b>Expert Manifester (Ex)</b>: At 17th level, a psychic duelist doesn't have to expend as many resources to create manifestations. She gains 1 additional MP each time she creates a psychic manifestation, in addition to the MP she gains by sacrificing resources. This doesn't increase the maximum number of points she can spend per manifestation, but does allow her to create a manifestation costing 1 MP without sacrificing any resources. This ability replaces telepathy.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypes\">^Archetypes</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"taSOE7lyKOmpo7KR"}
{"name":"Ley Lines","permission":{"default":0,"JgpLZkPryhl1EFab":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_4751keynkw3","path":"Pathfinder RPG - Occult Adventures Reference Library#/CF_SEP/Occult Adventures#/CF_SEP/CHAPTER 6: RUNNING AN OCCULT GAME","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\"></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Researchers into the occult theorize that all the worlds of the Material Plane and the planes beyond are alive. While the exact measure of life and consciousness the universe exhibits is debated, attempts to quantify this cosmic biology point toward the phenomenon of ley lines as proof. Ley lines are conduits of magical energy that traverse all known corners of creation, serving the same function as the veins and arteries of living creatures. These conduits, connecting geographical and cosmological features both great and small, grant knowledge and power to those who tap into them.</p><h1>Qualities of Ley Lines</h1><p>A ley line carries raw magical energy along with psychic impressions and other ambient energy its absorbs from its surroundings. This causes ley lines to seed magical effects, subconscious thoughts, and other supernatural phenomena along their paths, and sometimes creates unusual supernatural effects.</p><p>Psychic impressions carried down ley lines can impact the cultural and psychological growth of peoples living along the path of a ley line. Such alignments can cause two civilizations separated by thousands of miles-or even separated by planar boundaries-to evolve along similar developmental paths. Towns built on opposite ends of a ley line may have identical (or sometimes mirrored) street plans and similar histories. Artists living near a ley line may unconsciously convey their ideas to other artists on other planes, creating instances of parallel design. When a ley line penetrates planes, it can carry influences from one plane into another, making ley lines partially responsible for the appearance of tieflings and aasimars in bloodlines that had no prior history of contact with outsiders. This effect is also responsible for some of the propagation of sorcerous power, psychic powers, and other unusual magical phenomena such as haunts and loci spirits (see page 226).</p><p>Like the arteries of a circulatory system, ley lines come in many different sizes. The larger a ley line, the more capacity it has to carry magical energy. The size of a given ley line can change over time, however, and may vary at different points along its length. The size of a ley line generally impacts the strength and kinds of power that can be drawn from it by spellcasters. Ley lines have an effective caster level ranging from 1 to 20 that represents the overall strength of the ley line and determines the power of effects associated with it.</p><h1>Finding Ley Lines</h1></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>A ley line's natural state is as an imperceptible current of energy. Finding a ley line requires the use of a skill or spell that can detect the magical energy a ley line radiates. <i>Detect magic </i>can locate the presence of an accessible portion of a ley line within its area of effect and uses the ley line's effective caster level to determine its aura's strength as if the ley line were a magic item. <i>True seeing </i>reveals all accessible ley lines within its area of effect- they appear as ghostly bundles of tightly packed streams of energy. The color of a ley line is representative of its overall power level. Ley lines with a caster level of 1 are a dark violet color, while ley lines with a caster level of 20 are deep red. Ley lines with caster levels between 1 and 20 range across the color spectrum as appropriate (starting with violet and continuing to blue, green, yellow, orange, and finally red). Divination magic such as <i>contact other plane</i>, <i>divination</i>, and <i>commune </i>can help narrow down the location of a ley line. Additionally, <i>legend lore </i>can help reveal information about a known ley line. Occult skill unlocks such as dowsing (see page 195) can also help detect the presence of ley lines over long distances, which can be quite useful in locating an accessible portion of a ley line.</p><p>Because of ley lines' ability to pick up ambient energy, some local effects can cause portions of a ley line to become visible. For example, in areas of wild magic, an extant ley line may manifest as a shimmering river of rainbow-hued light constantly shifting through the color spectrum, while locations with a powerful presence of negative energy might cause a ley line to appear as a tendril of darkness that bleeds an ephemeral black smoke tinged with red light.</p><p>Ley lines do not generally move from location to location. While the exact paths they take may drift over the course of millennia or eons, these changes are largely unnoticed by all but the longest-lived races. As such, the discovery of a ley line can impact a region for millennia and draw attention from those seeking to exploit the ley line's power. Civilizations that discover ley lines sometimes mark the locations in which their power is most easily accessible by erecting monuments such as menhir circles or obelisks. These sites are typically used to perform rituals or other functions that tap into the latent power of a ley line to enhance spellcasting. A powerful wizard might build his tower atop a particularly strong ley line, a druidic sect might construct a menhir circle nearest to where a ley line touches the ground, or an ancient dragon might build its mountaintop lair as close to a ley line in the sky as possible. Accurate maps</p><p>and charts depicting the paths and intersections of ley lines are reliable for centuries or more and can reveal nodes of power across worlds and planes.</p><h1>Using Ley Lines</h1><p>While a ley line can range from hundreds to thousands of miles long or more, most portions of a ley line are only faintly visible to powerful magic, and their power is inaccessible. However, spellcasters can tap into rare sites where the power of ley lines is concentrated, or where ley lines cross, to increase their power. These sites can be of any size, ranging from a tiny cave under a great mountain to an entire mountain range.</p><p>Most of the effects generated by a ley line's accessible portions are passive and easy to miss. Planar energy, psychic impressions, and other collected powers bleed out into the land and influence the development of local life. A creature capable of casting spells or using spell-like abilities can attempt to tap into an accessible segment of a ley line within 100 feet. Doing so takes 1 hour per 2 caster levels of the ley line and requires a Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 20 + the ley line's caster level. Success indicates the creature is attuned to the ley line and gains a +1 bonus to its effective caster level for all spells and spell-like abilities. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 caster levels of the ley line, to a maximum of +5. Depending on the nature of the ley line convergence, this bonus may apply only to certain spells and spell-like abilities. For instance, a ley line convergence atop a great volcano might apply its bonus only to spells and spell-like abilities with the fire descriptor. Hags or other creatures with the coven ability benefit from the bonus of ley line attunement so long as at least one member of the coven is attuned to the ley line and all coven members are within 10 feet of an attuned creature. Some ley lines also grant creatures attuned to them special abilities such as bonus spells, spell-like abilities, or other supernatural effects. Once a creature is attuned to a ley line, the bond is permanent unless dispelled. <i>Dispel magic </i>and similar effects can break a creature's attunement to a ley line; the caster attempting to break the attunement must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 11 + the caster level of the ley line. When an attuned creature is more than 100 feet from the ley line, it gains no benefit from the attunement, but the benefits return when it is once again in proximity.</p><p>Ley lines can become damaged over the course of time, whether by extreme magical forces or other monumental events. Damage in this manner can cause a supernatural bruise that bleeds out into the location surrounding a ley line. Harming or destroying ley lines is difficult, given their monumental size and power. Even the weakest of ley lines are impervious to most physical and magical attacks, though great forces can exert influence over them. <i>Mage's disjunction </i>can potentially destroy a ley line, though this task requires the caster to succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 20 + the ley line's caster level. Doing so immediately deals 2d6 points of damage per caster level of the ley line (no saving throw) to the caster. Additionally, all creatures attuned to the ley line and able to benefit from attunement take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per caster level of the ley line when it is destroyed. There is a 1% chance per caster level of the ley line that its destruction creates a permanent <i>antimagic field </i>with a radius of 100 feet per caster level of the destroyed ley line. Furthermore, the caster of <i>mage's disjunction </i>who creates an <i>antimagic field </i>in this way must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or permanently lose all spellcasting abilities. These abilities cannot be recovered by mortal magic, not even via <i>miracle </i>or <i>wish</i>.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter6runninganoccultgame\">^Running an Occult Game</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter7occultrewards\">Occult Rewards</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"u0xyvtoRBes68dQ4"}

Though most spiritualists harbor phantoms, others instead command different powers gained from their extraplanar connections.</p><h1>ECTOPLASMATIST (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Instead of calling upon a phantom from the Ethereal Plane, an ectoplasmatist infuses herself with the mysterious substance called ectoplasm.</p><p><b>Ectoplasmic Lash (Su)</b>: At 1st level, as a full-round action an ectoplasmatist can manifest one or two lashes of ectoplasm tethered to her by wispy, ectoplasmic tendrils. If she manifests two lashes, she can wield them both as light melee weapons, each dealing 1d6 points of slashing damage (1d4 if the ectoplasmatist is Small) with a critical threat range and multiplier of 19-20/x2. If the ectoplasmatist manifests only one lash, she can manifest it either as a single one-handed melee weapon that deals 1d8 points of slashing damage (1d6 if the ectoplasmatist is Small) with a critical threat range and multiplier of 19-20/x2, or as a two-handed melee weapon that deals 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage (1d10 if the ectoplasmatist is Small) with a critical multiplier of x2. Only the ectoplasmatist can wield or use these lashes. Dismissing any or all manifested lashes is a free action.</p><p>At 2nd level, the ectoplasmatist's lashes gain a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, and are treated as magic weapons.</p><p>At 4th level, the ectoplasmatist can use her lashes as reach weapons or use them to manipulate objects from a distance. When used as weapons, the lashes gain an additional 5 feet of reach. Unlike most other weapons with reach, the lashes can be used to attack foes anywhere within the ectoplasmatist's reach (including adjacent foes). Attacks with the lashes' extended reach provoke attacks of opportunity just as if the ectoplasmatist were attacking with a ranged weapon. When the lashes are used to manipulate items, they have the same manual dexterity as the ectoplasmatist's hands. Using the lashes to manipulate items always provokes attacks of opportunity, even if the action the ectoplasmatist is taking normally wouldn't.</p><p>At 6th level, the lashes' enhancement bonus increases to +2, and they are treated as having the ectoplasmatist's alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p>At 8th level, the ectoplasmatist's lashes become <i>ghost touch </i>weapons and their reach increases by another 5 feet (for a total increase of 10 feet). Additionally, attacks with the lashes against nonadjacent foes no longer provoke attacks of opportunity. Using the lashes to manipulate objects from a distance still provokes attacks of opportunity, but only if the action the ectoplasmatist is taking would normally provoke such attacks (instead of always provoking).</p><p>At 10th level, the lashes' enhancement bonus increases to +3.</p><p>At 12th level, the ectoplasmatist chooses a single emotional focus (anger, dedication, despair, fear, hatred, jealousy, or zeal). The ectoplasmatist's lashes gain a special weapon ability as if affected by a <i>spirit-bound blade </i>spell (see page 187) matching the emotional energy of the focus the ectoplasmatist has chosen.</p><p>At 14th level, the lashes' enhancement bonus increases to +4.</p><p>At 16th level, the ectoplasmatist chooses a second emotional focus, and her lashes gain the special weapon abilities as if affected by a <i>spirit-bound blade </i>spell with the special weapon ability of both of the ectoplasmatist's chosen emotional foci.</p><p>At 18th level, the lashes' enhancement bonus increases to +5.</p><p>This ability replaces etheric tether, phantom, shared consciousness, fused consciousness, spiritual bond, and empowered consciousness.</p><p><b>Spiritual Combat (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, as a full-round action, an ectoplasmatist can make all of her attacks with a single light or one-handed ectoplasmic lash wielded in one hand, and also cast a single spiritualist spell with a casting time of one standard action as a free action either before or after making the ectoplasmic lash attacks. The ectoplasmatist takes a -2 penalty on her attack rolls when using spiritual combat. If she decides to cast the spell defensively, she can choose to take an additional penalty on her attack rolls up to her Wisdom bonus, and add the same amount as a circumstance bonus on her concentration check. If the concentration check fails, the spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty.</p><p>Also, when the ectoplasmatist casts a spiritualist spell with a range of touch, she can deliver the spell through one of her ectoplasmic lashes. Instead of making the free melee touch attack she would normally use to deliver the spell, the ectoplasmatist can choose to make a free ectoplasmic lash attack at her highest base attack bonus. A successful lash attack deals damage normally and imparts the spell's effects. The ectoplasmatist can't hold the charge if her lash attack misses.</p><p>This ability replaces bonded manifestation, phantom recall, and dual bond.</p><p><b>Ectoplasmic Armor (Su)</b>: At 4th level when an ectoplasmatist manifests her spiritual lash ability, tendrils of ectoplasmic material envelop her body, granting her a +4 armor bonus to AC.</p><p>At 12th level, the ectoplasmatist's armor bonus to AC increases to +6 and is treated as <i>ghost touch </i>armor.</p><p>This ability replaces spiritual interference and greater spiritual interference.</p><h1>FRACTURED MIND (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Most spiritualists harbor the spirits of the deceased in their psyches, but a small number of them-known as fractured minds-draw their powers instead from a fraction of their own souls that resonates with extremely powerful emotions. These spiritualists' phantoms are not spiritual allies, but rather extensions of the fractured minds' own inner thoughts and emotions.</p><p><b>Emotional Spellcasting</b>: A fractured mind's ability to cast spells is tied to the force of her own spirit rather than her connection to the spirit world. As a result, she uses her Charisma score rather than her Wisdom score to determine the highest spell level she can cast, the saving throw DCs of spells she casts, and her bonus spells per day. This ability alters spellcasting.</p><p><b>Emotional Power (Sp)</b>: The fractured mind gains a number of spell-like abilities, which are tied to her phantom's emotional focus. She gains one spell-like ability at 5th level, a second at 7th level, a third at 9th level, and a fourth at 16th level. A fractured mind can use each of these abilities once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 4 spiritualist levels she possesses beyond the level at which she gained the spell-like ability. The saving throw DCs for these spell-like abilities are equal to 10 + 1/2 the fractured mind's spiritualist class level + the fractured mind's Charisma modifier, rather than being based on the spell's level. The spell-like abilities granted by each emotional focus are listed below.</p><p><i>Anger</i>: <i>Enlarge person </i>(5th), <i>rage </i>(7th), <i>longstrider </i>(9th), <i>shout </i>(16th).</p><p><i>Dedication</i>: <i>Command </i>(5th), <i>spiritual weapon </i>(7th), <i>bless </i>(9th), <i>death ward </i>(16th).</p><p><i>Despair</i>: <i>Bungle</i>(UM) (5th), <i>stricken heart</i>(ACG) (7th), <i>doom </i>(9th), <i>crushing despair </i>(16th).</p><p><i>Fear</i>: <i>Bane </i>(5th), <i>mad hallucination</i>(UM) (7th), <i>doom </i>(9th), <i>phantasmal killer </i>(16th).</p><p><i>Hatred</i>: <i>Doom </i>(5th), <i>inflict moderate wounds </i>(7th), <i>bane </i>(9th), <i>bestow curse </i>(16th).</p><p><i>Jealousy</i>: <i>Sanctuary </i>(5th), <i>resist energy </i>(7th), <i>entropic shield </i>(9th), <i>spell immunity </i>(16th).</p><p><i>Zeal</i>: <i>Bless </i>(5th), <i>spiritual weapon </i>(7th), <i>divine favor </i>(9th), <i>freedom of movement </i>(16th).</p><p>This ability replaces <i>detect undead</i>, <i>calm spirit</i>, <i>see invisibility</i>, and <i>call spirit</i>.</p><h1>GEIST CHANNELER (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Some phantoms retain less of their personalities and memories than others. Though most phantoms maintain some semblance of their former selves, others of their kind, known as geists, came close to being lost forever before they became phantoms. Incapable of manifesting in ectoplasmic form and devoid of human emotions, these strange entities are much closer to ghosts than most other phantoms. The spiritualists who work with them, known as geist channelers, are able to call on them in unique ways.</p><p><b>Geistform Phantom (Su)</b>: A geist channeler's phantom can't manifest in ectoplasmic form, and is limited to manifesting in incorporeal form. As a result, the phantom has no Strength score, and has a starting Wisdom score of 12. Instead of gaining two slam attacks, it gains only a single slam attack that deals 1d8 points of damage. The slam attack's damage increases to 1d10 points at 5th level, to 2d6 at 10th level, to 2d8 at 15th level, and 2d10 at 20th level (assuming the phantom is Medium). The phantom does not gain the magic attacks ability at 4th level.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>While manifested incorporeally, a geist channeler's phantom can attack only other incorporeal creatures. Because the phantom is incorporeal, the damage it deals to such creatures is not reduced as a result of them being incorporeal. At 5th level, the phantom can take a swift action to infuse itself with trace amounts of ectoplasm so it can attack corporeal creatures for 1 round. During that time, it deals half damage to corporeal creatures with its slam, and corporeal creatures with nonmagical weapons deal half damage to the phantom. At 10th level, when the phantom infuses itself, its attacks deal normal damage to corporeal creatures.</p><p>This ability alters the phantom.</p><p><b>Emotionless (Su)</b>: A geist channeler's phantom doesn't have an emotional focus; instead, it is cold and devoid of emotions. The phantom gains a number of ranks in Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (religion) equal to its Hit Dice. While confined in the geist channeler's consciousness, the phantom grants the geist channeler Skill Focus in each of these skills. The phantom has good Reflex and Will saves, and gains Iron Will as a bonus feat, as well as the following abilities.</p><p><i>Unnerving Touch (Su)</i>: As a standard action, a geist channeler's phantom can make a melee touch attack against a living creature, even if that creature is corporeal. If the attack hits, the target is shaken for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier) negates this effect. At 5th level, when the phantom can damage corporeal creatures with its slam attack, its slam attacks against living corporeal creatures gain this ability. Multiple attacks against the same creature don't cause the creature to become frightened. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p><p><i>Poltergeist's Knack (Sp)</i>: At 7th level, a geist channeler's phantom can use <i>telekinesis </i>as a spell-like ability. It can use only the sustained force and violent thrust versions of this spell. The phantom can use this ability three times per day, plus one additional time at 10th level and every 3 levels thereafter (maximum seven times per day at 19th level). Its caster level for this spell-like ability is equal to the phantom's Hit Dice.</p><p><i>Spectral Protection (Su)</i>: At 12th level as a standard action, while a geist channeler's phantom is confined within his psyche, he can call upon its power to project an aura of spectral energy that prevents incorporeal creatures from approaching him. This takes the form of a 30-foot-radius emanation centered on the geist channeler. Any incorporeal creature attempting to enter this area must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the geist channeler's spiritualist class level + the geist channeler's Wisdom modifier) or be unable to do so. This ability can be used only defensively, not aggressively; forcing the aura against an incorporeal creature collapses the aura. The geist channeler can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to his spiritualist level. The minutes don't need to be continuous, but must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p><p><i>Malevolent Possession (Sp)</i>: At 17th level, a geist channeler's phantom can invade the bodies of other creatures. This functions as <i>possession </i>(see page 181)<i>. </i>To use this ability, the phantom must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the effect with a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier). The phantom can use this ability once per day.</p><p>This ability modifies the phantom and replaces the phantom's emotional focus.</p><p><b>Spiritual Manifestation (Su)</b>: Because of the nature of her phantom, a geist channeler can use the bonded manifestation ability to manifest his phantom only in incorporeal form. This ability alters bonded manifestation.</p><h1>HAUNTED (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>The haunted are a dangerous breed of spellcasters bound to temperamental and unpredictable phantoms that leech power from their spiritualists.</p><p><b>Usurp Manifestation (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, the haunted's phantom begins to subtly subvert the relationship with its master, gaining rather than granting power from the connection. When fully manifested in ectoplasmic form, the phantom can use its usurp manifestation ability to draw upon the haunted's body to strengthen its ectoplasmic might, temporarily weakening the spiritualist in order to increase its own power. The phantom must activate this ability as an immediate action at the start of the spiritualist's turn, and it can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + the haunted's spiritualist level. The rounds don't need to be consecutive, and the phantom can dismiss the effects of a usurped manifestation as a free action on its turn. While this ability is in effect, the haunted's features become sunken and withdrawn, and she gains the nauseated condition until the effect ends. Conversely, the phantom surges in size and power, becoming one size category larger (as if affected by an <i>enlarge person </i>spell) and increasing its natural armor bonus to AC by 2 for the effect's duration. If the spiritualist prevents or mitigates the nauseated condition, the phantom is unable to siphon energy and doesn't gain the benefits of usurp manifestation.</p><p>At 8th level and every 5 levels thereafter (13th and 18th levels), the phantom gains new abilities while using usurp manifestation.</p><p><i>Usurp Spell</i>: At 8th level, while using usurp manifestation, the phantom can leech spell slots from the haunted to increase its own power. The phantom can reach through the etheric tether as a swift action to drain the nauseated haunted's psychic spell energy, effectively taking any touch spell or spell with a target of \"you\" that the haunted knows and casting it on itself (assuming the haunted has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell's level). This ability consumes two of the haunted's spell slots of the appropriate level and otherwise follows the rules for the share spells and deliver touch spells abilities.</p><p><i>Teleplasmic Surge</i>: At 13th level, when using usurp manifestation, the phantom gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.</p><p><i>Ferocious Phantom</i>: At 18th level, when using usurp manifestation the phantom gains DR 10/slashing and spell resistance equal to 11 + the haunted's spiritualist level (this spell resistance doesn't apply to spells originating from the spiritualist or from the usurp spell ability).</p><p>This ability replaces bonded manifestation.</p><p><b>Usurped Bond (Su)</b>: At 17th level, the haunted's phantom can use usurp manifestation for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + double the haunted's spiritualist level. This ability replaces dual bond.</p><h1>ONMYOJI (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Though most spiritualists are chosen by their phantoms, others deliberately call phantoms to them through years of careful preparation and study in obscure divine traditions. These spiritualists, known as onmyoji, form close bonds with their phantoms, as any other spiritualist does, but see the phantoms as partners and tools in their work. Onmyoji serve as emissaries between the mundane world and the spiritual one, either working to ensure that troubles in the spiritual world do not spill over into the world of mortals, or stirring up spiritual trouble in order to achieve their ends among the living.</p><p><b>Divine Spellcasting</b>: An onmyoji's spellcasting ability comes from divine rather than psychic power. As a divine caster, the onmyoji's spells use verbal components instead of thought components, and somatic components instead of emotional components, and she uses an ofuda as a divine focus. Ofudas are scrolls with holy writings written on parchment, cloth, or wood (having the same cost as a wooden holy symbol) or metal (having the same cost as a silver holy symbol). This ability alters spellcasting.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Spiritual Resistance (Su)</b>: An onmyoji's phantom provides her with protection from supernatural forces. While the phantom is confined within the onmyoji's consciousness (not stranded on the Ethereal Plane or fully manifested), it grants her a +2 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey, outsiders, and incorporeal undead. At 6th level and every 6 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 18th level). This ability replaces shared consciousness and fused consciousness.</p><p><b>Divine Teachings (Su)</b>: An onmyoji gains the ability to call upon her phantom to help her cast spells she normally couldn't. At 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, an onmyoji can choose a single spell from the cleric spell list with a spell level she is currently able to cast, and add that spell to her list of spells known, at the same spell level as it appears on the cleric spell list. Because the onmyoji relies on her phantom's influence in order to cast these spells, she can cast spells added in this way only while the phantom is confined within her consciousness (not stranded on the Ethereal Plane or fully manifested). This ability replaces spiritual interference and greater spiritual interference.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypes\">^Archetypes</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"wRpU6ZfqqNOXsOiv"}
{"name":"Feat Descriptions","permission":{"default":0,"JgpLZkPryhl1EFab":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_n5g2cd5n3xj","path":"Pathfinder RPG - Occult Adventures Reference Library#/CF_SEP/Occult Adventures#/CF_SEP/CHAPTER 3: FEATS","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\"></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>The feats in this chapter are summarized on Table 3-1: Feats on pages 130-131. Note that the prerequisites and benefits of the feats listed in this table are abbreviated for ease of reference. See the feats' descriptions for full details.</p><p>The following format is used for all feat descriptions.</p><p><b>Feat Name</b>: The name entry indicates the feat's name as well as what type, if any, the feat belongs to, and is followed by a basic description of what the feat does.</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b>: This entry gives the required minimum ability score, other feats, minimum base attack bonus, minimum number of ranks in one or more skills, or anything else required in order to take the feat. This entry is absent if a feat has no prerequisites. A feat can have more than one prerequisite. Many prerequisites-such as classes, class abilities, and feats-can be found elsewhere in this book.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: This entry describes what a feat enables the character (\"you\" in the feat description) to do. If a character takes the same feat more than once, its benefits don't stack unless indicated otherwise in the description.</p><p><b>Normal</b>: This entry states what a character who doesn't have this feat is limited to or restricted from doing. It is typically included when a feat interacts with rules systems in an unusual way.</p><p><b>Special</b>: Additional unusual facts about the feat, if any, appear here</p><h1>Alter Binary Mindscape</h1><p>You can shift and change a binary mindscape to your advantage during a psychic duel.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Int 13, ability to cast <i>instigate psychic duel</i>.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: When you cast <i>instigate psychic duel </i>and create a binary mindscape (see page 235), the arena you create puts your enemy at a disadvantage. Your opponent must spend 1 more manifestation point than normal when creating any defensive manifestations.</p><h1>Bleeding Stare (Combat, Stare)</h1><p>Your stare causes your foe to bleed out of its eyes.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Mesmerist level 5th, painful stare class feature.</p><p><b>Benefits</b>: When you trigger your painful stare, the target takes an amount of bleed damage equal to 1/3 your mesmerist level. Bleed damage from multiple uses of Bleeding Stare doesn't stack.</p><h1>Chakra Adept</h1><p>Your body and soul have grown more accustomed to kundalini energy.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Chakra Initiate, ability to awaken the heart chakra.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: Your pool of serpent-fire ki increases to 4 points. When you maintain your chakras as a swift action without opening a new chakra, you can choose to attempt either the Fortitude save or the Will save instead of both.</p><p>In addition, after you stop spending ki to maintain your chakras, the kundalini energy lingers in your body. On the first round during which you spend no ki to maintain your chakras, your highest chakra closes and you can spend a swift action to use any one of the abilities of your remaining open chakras. On the next round after that, all of your chakras close, and you must spend 1 point of ki and a swift action to start again from your root chakra.</p><h1>Chakra Initiate</h1><p>You have an extra wellspring of kundalini energy that you can use to open your chakras.</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Ability to awaken the root chakra.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain a pool that holds 3 points of serpent-fire ki, which you can use only to open or maintain chakras. These serpent-fire ki points are replenished at the same time you replenish the points in your regular ki pool.</p><h1>Chakra Master</h1><p>You have mastered all seven chakras, and use your ki to pull more power from the kundalini flow.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Chakra Adept, Chakra Initiate, ability to awaken the crown chakra.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: Your pool of serpent-fire ki increases to 5 points. You can spend 3 ki points instead of 1 when you open or maintain a chakra to gain the benefits of two chakras instead of one in that round. If you are opening or maintaining your crown chakra, this stacks with the crown chakra's special power, allowing you to gain the benefits of three chakras in a round.</p><h1>Compounded Pain (Combat)</h1><p>Your painful stare causes two additional effects.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Mesmerist level 13th, painful stare class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: You can apply the effects of two stare feats to your painful stares.</p><p><b>Normal</b>: You can apply the effects of only one stare feat to a given painful stare.</p><h1>Delay Blast</h1><p>You can delay your kinetic blasts.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Base attack bonus +3, kinetic blast class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: When you use a kinetic blast, you can specify a number of rounds between 1 and 5. When that number of rounds has passed, the kinetic blast takes effect at the beginning of your turn. In the interim, you can take a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity to cause the blast to take effect earlier than you initially selected. If you delay another blast while you already have a delayed blast pending, the previous delayed blast dissipates harmlessly.</p><p>You must make any decisions you would make about the delayed blast-including designating target positions, choosing infusions, and determining or shaping the area-when you first use the blast. The blast originates from your position at the time you used the blast, not your current position when the blast takes effect, and it targets the position or area you had specified (which may or may not include any targets). A delayed blast radiates an aura of magic appropriate for its spell level even while it is delayed, and during that time, it can be dispelled by <i>dispel magic</i>.</p><h1>Demoralizing Stare (Combat, Stare)</h1><p>Your painful stare inspires fear in your foes.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Mesmerist level 9th, painful stare class feature.</p><p><b>Benefits</b>: When you trigger your painful stare, the target must succeed at a Will Save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your mesmerist level + your Charisma modifier) or become shaken for 1 round. This can't cause the target to become frightened, even if the target is already shaken.</p><h1>Disciplinary Devotee</h1><p>Your careful study of mental magic grants you mastery in your discipline.</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Psychic discipline class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain a +1 bonus on caster level checks and concentration checks when casting spells from your psychic discipline, and you gain a +1 insight bonus on saving throws against spells from your discipline.</p><h1>Distant Delivery</h1><p>Your phantom can deliver spells at a greater range than usual.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Phantom class feature, phantom with the deliver touch spells ability.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: The distance from you at which your phantom can deliver touch spells increases by 20 feet.</p><h1>Efficient Focus Shift</h1><p>You are more adept than most at shifting mental focus between your implements.</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Occultist level 7th.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: Twice per day when you shift mental focus from one implement to another, you can add the same number of points to the latter implement that you removed from the former.</p><p><b>Normal</b>: By removing points of mental focus from one implement, you can add the same amount - 1 to another.</p><p><b>Special</b>: You can take this feat multiple times. Its effects stack.</p><h1>Elongated Cranium</h1><p>You have undergone the painful and ancient art of cranial binding, deforming your skull to unlock the hidden potential of your psychic self.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: Your cranium has been tightly bound with boards and wrappings to change its shape and attune your mind to your psychic discipline. If you take this feat after 1st level, you must undergo a painful 6-month regimen of increased tightening and head binding, during which you take a -1 penalty on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks and on Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based skill checks. Once the binding is completed, your skull takes on one of three shapes of your choosing, each with a specific benefit. Once chosen, this shape cannot be changed.</p><p><i>Fronto-Occipital Elongation</i>: Your head slopes severely in a high conical shape, tapering from your brow to the crown of your head. You take a -1 penalty on Intelligence and Wisdom checks and on Intelligence- and Wisdom-based skill checks, but gain a +2 bonus on Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks. In addition, once per day, you can extend the duration of a psychic spell you cast by 50% (minimum 0 additional rounds). The increased duration doesn't stack with the increase granted by the Extend Spell feat.</p><p><i>Ovoid Compression</i>: Your head takes on a larger, more bulbous appearance than normal. You take a -1 penalty on Charisma and Wisdom checks and on Wisdom- and Charisma-based skill checks, but gain a +2 bonus on Intelligence checks and Intelligence-based skill checks. In addition, once per day you can cast one psychic magic spell you know with a +1 bonus to its caster level.</p><p><i>Sagittal Elongation: </i>Your head slopes back in a gentle, elongated curve. You take a -1 penalty on Intelligence and Charisma checks and on Intelligence- and Charisma-based skill checks, but gain a +2 bonus on Wisdom checks and Wisdom-based skill checks. In addition, once per day, you can increase the DC of a psychic spell you cast by 1.</p><h1>Emotional Conduit</h1><p>The deep emotional resonance you share with your phantom enables you to master the emotions of others.</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Shared consciousness class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain familiarity with a number of additional spells based on the emotional focus of your phantom. These spells are added to both your class spell list (if not already on that list) and your list of spells known; they are in addition to the normal number of spells known for your level. The spells you gain are as follows (spells marked with a dagger [X] can be found in Chapter 4: Psychic Magic):</p><p><i>Anger</i>: 1st-<i>burst of adrenaline</i>(X), 2nd-<i>rage</i>, 3rd-<i>howling agony</i>(UM), 4th-<i>telekinetic charge</i>(UC), 5th-<i>vengeful outrage</i>(UM), 6th-<i>transformation</i>.</p><p><i>Despair</i>: 1st-<i>touch of gracelessness</i>(APG), 2nd-<i>death knell</i>, 3rd-<i>ray of exhaustion</i>, 4th-<i>crushing despair</i>, 5th- <i>suffocation</i>(APG), 6th-<i>eyebite</i>.</p><p><i>Devotion</i>: 1st-<i>invisibility alarm</i>(ACG), 2nd-<i>spiritual weapon</i>, 3rd-<i>cure light wounds</i>, 4th-<i>spell immunity</i>, 5th-<i>vampiric shadow shield</i>(ACG), 6th-<i>greater heroism</i>.</p><p><i>Fear</i>: 1st-<i>heightened awareness</i>(ACG), 2nd-<i>scare</i>, 3rd-<i>fear</i>, 4th-<i>feast on fear</i>(ACG), 5th-<i>nightmare</i>, 6th-<i>frightful aspect</i>(UC).</p><p><i>Hatred</i>: 1st-<i>murderous command</i>(UM), 2nd-<i>disfiguring touch</i>(UM), 3rd-<i>bestow curse</i>, 4th-<i>debilitating portent</i>(UC), 5th- <i>foster hatred</i>(X), 6th-<i>phantasmal revenge</i>(APG).</p><p><i>Jealousy</i>: 1st-<i>compel hostility</i>(UC), 2nd-<i>life pact</i>(ACG), 3rd- <i>ectoplasmic snare</i>(X), 4th-<i>entrap spirit</i>(X), 5th-<i>dominate person</i>, 6th-<i>unwilling shield</i>(APG).</p><p><i>Zeal</i>: 1st-<i>delusional pride</i>(UM), 2nd-<i>false life</i>, 3rd-<i>heroism</i>, 4th-<i>freedom of movement</i>, 5th-<i>joyful rapture</i>(UM), 6th-<i>greater heroism</i>.</p><h1>Empath</h1><p>You have learned how to psychically sense an individual's mood or altered mental state.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Psychic Sensitivity or ability to cast psychic spells, Perception 1 rank or Sense Motive 1 rank.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: You can use either Perception or Sense Motive when reading an emotion aura with the read aura occult skill unlock. Reading a creature's emotion aura takes you only a full-round action instead of 10 minutes, and if you succeed at your check, you also determine whether that creature is currently affected by a fear or mind-affecting effect and the relative strength of that effect (minor, moderate, strong, as defined in <i>detect magic</i>). You don't learn the source of the effect or the actual effect.</p><p>You can also use the read aura occult skill unlock to read emotion auras more than once per day by opening your innate mental defenses. For 1 minute after you use this feat, you take a -4 penalty on saving throws against fear and mind-affecting effects (regardless of whether you succeeded at the check). During this time, you're also unable to attempt to read emotion auras. Using this feat doesn't use up your one daily use of the read aura unlock, which you can still use either to read another type of aura or to read an emotion aura without taking the penalty associated with this feat.</p><h1>Excoriating Stare (Combat, Stare)</h1><p>Your painful stare burns through your opponents.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Mesmerist level 11th, painful stare class feature.</p><p><b>Benefits</b>: Whenever you trigger a painful stare, the target must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your mesmerist level + your Charisma modifier) or become sickened by the pain for 1 round.</p><h1>Expanded Phrenic Pool</h1><p>Your reservoir of mental energy is greater than normal.</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Phrenic pool class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: Your phrenic pool total increases by 2 points.</p><h1>Extend Resonant Power</h1><p>You can share the benefits of your resonant focus powers with nearby allies.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Caster level 7th, mental focus class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: Select an implement school. When you place mental focus points into an implement of that school, you can choose to gain benefits from the resonant power as if you had placed only half as many points of mental focus into the implement. If you do, you can extend the same benefits to one additional ally within 30 feet at the time you invest mental focus. If the ally moves outside of the extended power's range, the power is suppressed, but it resumes functioning once the ally moves within range again. You can spend 1 point of mental focus from your implement to pass the effect to a new target, so long as both the original target and the new one are within 30 feet. This feat can affect only one implement from a given school at a time, even if you have selected the same implement school more than once.</p><p><b>Special</b>: You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, select a different implement school.</p><h1>Extended Stare</h1><p>Your hypnotic stare has greater reach than normal.</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Hypnotic stare class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: The range of your hypnotic stare increases by 10 feet.</p><p><b>Special</b>: You can take this feat multiple times. Its effects stack.</p><h1>Extra Amplification</h1><p>You are a master at manipulating your mental energies to produce amplified effects.</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Phrenic amplification class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain one additional phrenic amplification. This can't be a major amplification.</p><p><b>Special</b>: You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, you gain another phrenic amplification.</p><h1>Extra Focus Power</h1><p>You gain an additional focus power from your implements.</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Focus power class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain one additional focus power from among those available from your chosen implement schools. You must select a power for which you normally qualify.</p><p><b>Special</b>: You can choose this feat once for every implement school you know, up to a maximum of seven times at 18th level. Each time you do, you must choose a different focus power. If you have selected the same implement school more than once, you can select a focus power from that school once for each time you selected that school.</p><h1>Extra Mental Focus</h1><p>You possess increased mental focus.</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Mental focus class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain 2 additional points of mental focus.</p><h1>Extra Mesmerist Tricks</h1><p>You can use your mesmerist tricks more often.</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Mesmerist trick class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: You can implant two additional mesmerist tricks per day.</p><p><b>Special</b>: You can gain Extra Mesmerist Tricks multiple times. Its effects stack.</p><h1>Extra Touch Treatment</h1><p>You can use your touch treatment more often.</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Touch treatment class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: You can use touch treatment two additional times per day.</p><h1>Extra Wild Talent</h1><p>You gain an additional wild talent.</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Kineticist level 6th.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain a wild talent that's at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level wild talent you can currently use. You can select an infusion or a non-infusion wild talent, but not a blast or defense wild talent. If you have the expanded element class feature, you can select a wild talent from any of your elements that's at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level wild talent from your primary element that you can currently use.</p><p><b>Special</b>: You can take this feat multiple times. Each time, you must choose a different wild talent.</p><h1>Fatiguing Stare (Combat, Stare)</h1><p>Your painful stare fatigues your opponent.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Mesmerist level 7th, painful stare class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: When a target takes damage from your painful stare, it must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your mesmerist level + your Charisma modifier) or become fatigued for 1 round. This can't cause the target to become exhausted, even if the target is already fatigued.</p><h1>Fearsome Spell (Metamagic)</h1><p>Your spells inspire great fear in those harmed by them.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: When a creature takes damage from a fearsome spell, if that creature failed its save against the spell, it becomes shaken for a number of rounds equal to the spell's original level. If the spell doesn't allow a save, creatures harmed by it can attempt a Will save (against the same DC the spell would have if it did allow a save) to negate the shaken effect. If the spell effect already causes creatures to become shaken, on a failed save, add the duration of this metamagic effect to the duration of the shaken condition imposed by the spell. A fearsome spell can't cause a creature to become frightened, even if that creature is already shaken. A fearsome spell uses up a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell's actual level.</p><h1>Focused Phantom</h1><p>Your close bond with your phantom helps you to focus your concentration .</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Spiritual interference class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: While you are adjacent to your phantom or your phantom is within your consciousness, you receive a +4 bonus on concentration checks.</p><h1>Furious Spell (Metamagic)</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Your spells seethe with the ferocious intensity of your blood-red rage.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: A furious spell that deals hit point damage adds twice the spell's original level to the amount of damage dealt by the spell. Spells that affect multiple targets deal the extra damage once to each target, regardless of whether the spell deals its damage all at once or in multiple hits (in the latter case, add the extra damage to the first hit against each target). In addition, a furious spell can be cast while the caster is enraged, including during a barbarian rage or while affected by a <i>rage </i>spell. Even a furious spell that requires an emotion component can be cast while enraged. The caster gains a +2 circumstance bonus on concentration checks and caster level checks related to casting a furious spell if she is enraged. A furious spell uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Greater Mesmerizing Feint (Combat)</h1><p>You can feint against nearly any creature.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Mesmerizing Feint, Bluff 10 ranks, hypnotic stare class feature, psychic inception bold stare.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: You can feint against mindless creatures at a -4 penalty. Such a creature must be a subject of your hypnotic stare, and the creature has a 50% chance of ignoring the effects of your feint.</p><p><b>Normal</b>: Feinting against a creature that is mindless is impossible.</p><h1>Hidden Presence</h1><p>You are adept at hiding within your host.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Int or Cha 17, ability to cast <i>possession </i>or <i>greater possession. </i></p><p><b>Benefit</b>: While possessing another creature, you can hide yourself from divinations and pass through wards such as <i>magic circle against evil </i>or the effects of a <i>forbiddance </i>spell. You must attempt a Will save against the spell (even if it doesn't normally allow a saving throw). If you succeed, the spell treats you as if you were your host (for instance, divinations would reveal only the host's alignment, and <i>forbiddance </i>keyed to the host's alignment wouldn't damage you). If your saving throw fails, the spell functions against you as normal; if the spell normally allows a save, your previous failure doesn't count as a failed save against the spell's normal effects.</p><h1>Implement Focus</h1><p>You are more adept at spending generic focus on focus powers from your chosen school.</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Occultist level 3rd.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: Select one of your implement schools. When you spend generic focus to activate focus powers with one of that school's implements, the focus powers cost their listed amount of mental focus.</p><p><b>Normal</b>: Any focus power activated with generic focus costs twice as much focus to use and maintain.</p><p><b>Special</b>: You can take this feat multiple times. Each time, you must select a different implement school.</p><h1>Intense Pain (Combat, Stare)</h1><p>You deal additional damage when using your painful stare.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Mesmerist level 7th, painful stare class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: When you use your painful stare ability to increase your own damage, you deal an additional 1d6 points of damage. This damage increases to 2d6 at mesmerist level 12th and to 3d6 at mesmerist level 18th. When you use painful stare to augment an ally's damage, the target of the painful stare takes 1 additional point of damage for every 4 mesmerist levels you possess.</p><h1>Interweave Composite Blast (Combat, Teamwork)</h1></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>You can combine your blasts with those of another kineticist.</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Kinetic blast class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: Whenever you are within 15 feet of another character who has this feat, you can ready an action to activate a simple blast of your choice. When that character unleashes a simple blast, yours is triggered, creating a composite blast for which the two simple blasts meet the prerequisites. The composite blast's caster level is equal to the average of the caster levels of both participants and deals damage as the appropriate composite blast created by a kineticist of that level (for example, if a 10th-level pyrokineticist and a 6th-level hydrokineticist worked together to create a steam blast, its base damage would be 4d6+4 points of fire damage and 4d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage).</p><p>One participant can provide a form infusion appropriate for the composite blast, and the other can provide an appropriate substance infusion. Each participant accepts the burn cost for the infusion she provided. The participant who didn't take the special ready action can apply a metakinesis to the blast, and she is the only one who can gather power to reduce the blast's cost (since only she has a move action to take prior to the blast). However, whatever metakinesis she applies affects the entire composite blast.</p><p>If the two participants aren't adjacent to each other, the origin point of cones, lines, and other effects that normally originate from a character's square instead originate from a point in the square located halfway between the two participants in a straight line (where the two simple blasts meet and form the composite blast).</p><p>The blast uses the Constitution modifier of whoever provided the substance infusion and the Dexterity modifier of whoever provided the form infusion. If the blast includes only one infusion, the blast uses the Constitution or Dexterity modifier of the kineticist who supplied that infusion, as appropriate for the infusion provided. If no infusions are used, the two kineticists choose one of them to provide the Dexterity modifier, and the other provides the Constitution modifier.</p><h1>Intimidating Glance (Combat)</h1><p>Your gaze strikes fear into your enemies.</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Hypnotic stare class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: You can attempt to demoralize the target of your hypnotic stare as a swift action.</p><p><b>Normal</b>: Attempting to demoralize an opponent is a standard action.</p><h1>Intrusive Presence</h1><p>You can rifle through the thoughts and memories of your host.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Int or Cha 21, Hidden Presence, Manipulative Presence, ability to cast <i>possession </i>or <i>greater possession</i>.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: You can use <i>detect thoughts </i>at will as a spell-like ability against a host creature you possess. The host receives no saving throw, and the effect functions as if you had concentrated for 3 rounds. You can also use <i>seek thoughts </i>on your host as a spell-like ability once during the possession. The host can attempt a Will save with a DC equal to the DC of the original possession effect. If the host succeeds, the effect fails and the host become aware of the possession if it wasn't already.</p><h1>Intuitive Spell (Metamagic)</h1><p>You can avoid the need for thought components by trusting your instincts.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: An intuitive spell can be cast with no thought components. Spells without thought components are not affected. An intuitive spell uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.</p><h1>Kinetic Counter</h1></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>You can use your kinetic blast to counter your enemy's opposing elemental abilities.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Cold simple blast, fire simple blast, or water simple blast; kinetic blast class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: You can ready an action to use your blast to counter an opponent's elemental abilities. If you ready a fire simple blast, you can counter any spell or activated extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like ability that has the water or ice descriptor, and if you ready a cold or water simple blast, you can counter any spell or activated extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like ability that has the fire descriptor. In order to successfully counter the effect, you must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to either 11 + the opponent's caster level (for spells and spell-like abilities) or 11 + the opponent's Hit Dice (for extraordinary and supernatural abilities). Against spells and spell-like abilities, treat a success as if you had counterspelled the effect using <i>dispel magic</i>. Against activated supernatural and extraordinary abilities, a successful kinetic counter negates the ability's effect entirely while still expending the ability. For example, if a pyrokineticist succeeds at her caster level check against a white dragon's breath weapon, she negates the breath weapon's effect in the entire area, and the dragon must wait 1d4 rounds to use its breath weapon again.</p><h1>Kinetic Leap</h1><p>Kinetic energy propels you when you jump.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Acrobatics 3 ranks, kinetic blast class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: Once per day as a swift action, you can conjure a burst of energy from your kinetic blast to help you jump a long distance, adding a +10 bonus on your Acrobatics check to jump; if you have at least 10 ranks in Acrobatics, the bonus increases to +20.

If you are killed at any point before your burn is removed, your body instantly erupts in an explosion that deals an amount of damage equal to that of your simple blast to all creatures in a 5-foot radius.

These temporary hit points last for 1 hour. Psychic healing doesn't require a healer's kit. A creature can benefit from psychic healing only once per day, and can't benefit from both this ability and treat deadly wounds in the same day.</p><h1>Psychic Maestro</h1><p>You can use two occult skill unlocks more often.</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Psychic Sensitivity or the ability to cast psychic spells.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: Choose two occult skill unlocks.

This is in addition to the normal daily use of read aura (which still takes 10 minutes).

Each time the target fails its save, it must save again the following night or be affected by another <i>nightmare</i>, though the save DC decreases by 2 each night after the first. This metamagic feat can be applied only to spells with the emotion or fear descriptor. A traumatic spell uses up a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell's actual level.</p><h1>Vigilant Phantom</h1><p>Your phantom is highly observant, and its link with you increases your own watchfulness.</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Phantom class feature.</p><p><b>Benefit</b>: While your phantom is within your reach, you gain a +4 bonus on Perception checks.

The number of spirits is countless, and each has its own idiosyncrasies that make it distinct. Nonetheless, all spirits arise from one of the following six legends: archmage, champion, guardian, hierophant, marshal, or trickster.</p><h1>Archmage</h1><p>An archmage spirit is a font of knowledge and arcane power.</p><p><b>Spirit Bonus</b>: When you channel an archmage, your spirit bonus applies on concentration checks, Intelligence checks, and Intelligence-based skill checks.</p><p><b>Seance Boon</b>: Your damaging spells deal an additional 2 points of damage of the same type that they would normally deal to each target.</p><p><b>Favored Locations</b>: Arcane redoubts, areas of unusual magic, libraries, schools.</p><p><b>Influence Penalty</b>: Your body begins to respond as if you were a frail, aged scholar. You take a penalty equal to your spirit bonus on Strength checks, Strength-based skill checks, Constitution checks, attack rolls, and non-spell damage rolls.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Taboos</b>: Choose one: You eschew all faith in the divine, so you must not be the willing target of divine spells or abilities and you must attempt a Will saving throw against even harmless divine spells and abilities; you must not pass up the opportunity to learn something new and significant (a nontrivial piece of information with a Knowledge check of DC 20 or higher) when that opportunity is directly present; you must use your own magical solution to a challenge if you can, even if a mundane solution that would require fewer resources is available.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Archmage Arcana (Lesser, Su)</b>: Instead of your normal spells per day for your medium level, you use the spells per day from Table 1-4: Mesmerist. For each level of spell you can now cast (including level 0), each time you channel an archmage spirit, select a single spell of that level from the sorcerer/wizard spell list to add to your medium spell list and spells known until you lose contact with the archmage. When you cast these spells, they count as arcane (though not for the purpose of fulfilling prerequisites), and thus you must provide verbal and somatic components instead of thought and emotion components (see page 144).</p><p><b>Arcane Surge (Intermediate, Su)</b>: You can allow the archmage spirit to gain 1 point of influence over you in order to cast one of your medium spells known without expending a spell slot. When you do so, the caster level and DC of the spell increase by 1, and you can't apply metamagic to the spell.</p><p><b>Wild Arcana (Greater, Su)</b>: You can allow the archmage spirit to gain 1 point of influence over you in order to cast any sorcerer/wizard spell of a level you can cast. You must expend a spell slot of the appropriate level, and you can't apply metamagic to the spell.</p><p><b>Legendary Archmage (Supreme, Su)</b>: Once per day, you can cast any spell on the sorcerer/wizard spell list as if using the wild arcana ability, except the archmage doesn't gain 1 point of influence over you, the spell doesn't require a spell slot, and you can select a spell of any level.</p><h1>Champion</h1><p>A champion spirit is a paragon of skill at arms.</p><p><b>Spirit Bonus</b>: When you channel a champion, your spirit bonus applies on attack rolls, non-spell damage rolls, Strength checks, Strength-based skill checks, and Fortitude saves.</p><p><b>Seance Boon</b>: You gain a +2 bonus on all non-spell damage rolls.</p><p><b>Favored Locations</b>: Arenas, battlefields, places of violence, practice yards.</p><p><b>Influence Penalty</b>: You are quick to violence and prefer a weapon to spells or contemplation. You take a penalty equal to your spirit bonus on Intelligence checks and Intelligence-based skill checks, and to your caster level (to a minimum of caster level 0); as usual, a reduced caster level may render you unable to cast spells. You can't benefit from effects that increase your caster level.</p><p><b>Taboos</b>: Choose one: you are superstitious about arcane spellcasting, so you must not be the willing target of arcane spells or abilities and you must attempt a Will saving throw against even harmless arcane spells and abilities; you may not make an attack with any weapon except a specific manufactured weapon (such as \"my father's <i>+2 falchion</i>\") that you choose when you take the taboo, and you may not choose unarmed strike for this taboo; you must accept any challenge to prove your prowess in battle, including challenges to single combat-if you or an ally breaks the rules of the challenge, you break this taboo.</p><p><b>Champion's Prowess (Lesser, Su)</b>: You gain proficiency in all martial weapons and in one exotic weapon of your choice, which you choose each time you channel a champion spirit.</p><p><b>Sudden Attack (Intermediate, Su)</b>: Whenever you take a full-attack action, you gain one additional attack at your highest base attack bonus. This ability stacks with the extra attack from <i>haste</i>, but it doesn't stack with special actions that grant extra attacks, such as flurry of blows or spell combat. Sudden attack works as normal with full-attack options such as two-weapon fighting.</p><p><b>Fleet Charge (Greater, Su)</b>: You can take a swift action and a full-round action to move up to your speed and then make a full attack. This special action doesn't combine with sudden attack, but works as normal with effects such as <i>haste </i>and two-weapon fighting. As soon as you begin moving, you are considered to have begun the full-round action, even if circumstances prevent you from attacking at the end of your movement.</p><p><b>Legendary Champion (Supreme, Su)</b>: You gain two combat feats of your choice, and you can choose different feats each time you channel a champion spirit. You can treat your base attack bonus from your medium levels as equal to your medium level for the purposes of qualifying for combat feats and determining their effects, and you can count your medium levels as levels of one other class whose base attack bonus equals its class level (such as fighter, barbarian, or slayer) for the purpose of qualifying for the two new combat feats.</p><h1>Guardian</h1><p>A guardian spirit is an exemplar of protection and defense.</p><p><b>Spirit Bonus</b>: When you channel a guardian, your spirit bonus applies to AC and on Constitution checks, Fortitude saves, and Reflex saves.</p><p><b>Seance Boon</b>: You gain a +1 bonus to CMD.</p><p><b>Favored Locations</b>: City walls, forts, gates, keeps.</p><p><b>Influence Penalty</b>: You are incredibly cautious and guarded in all things, and your caution sometimes gets in the way. When attacking, you always fight defensively, and when casting a spell, you always cast defensively. Because of your focus on defense, you take a penalty on damage rolls equal to your spirit bonus.</p><p><b>Taboos</b>: Choose one: you must always protect others from danger when you can (including defeated enemies, but not enemies that are an active threat to you and others); you must keep your body in fit physical condition, and you break this taboo every time you drop below half your maximum hit points; you must speak no words and use no abilities with the sonic descriptor, and you break this taboo if you become enraged, frightened, or panicked.</p><p><b>Guardian's Shield (Lesser, Su)</b>: You gain proficiency in heavy armors and shields (including tower shields).</p><p><b>Absorb Blow (Intermediate, Su)</b>: You gain DR/- and resistance to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic equal to 1/2 your medium level. Add <i>paladin's sacrifice</i>(APG) to your medium spells known as a 2nd-level spell.</p><p><b>Sudden Block (Greater, Su)</b>: After an enemy's attack would hit you or an adjacent creature, you can use spirit surge to increase the victim's AC, possibly causing the attack to fail, by rolling your spirit surge die and adding it to the chosen character's AC. You must not be flat-footed, and you must be aware of the attack. If use of this ability causes the enemy's attack to miss, you can make an attack at your highest base attack bonus against that enemy as an immediate action.</p><p><b>Legendary Guardian (Supreme, Su)</b>: Once per day as an immediate action, you can ignore the effects of a single attack against you, including enemy spells targeting you or whose area or effect includes you. The attack affects other creatures as normal.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Hierophant</h1><p>A hierophant spirit is a being of true and pure faith.</p><p><b>Spirit Bonus</b>: When you channel a hierophant, your spirit bonus applies on Wisdom checks, Wisdom-based skill checks, and Will saves.</p><p><b>Seance Boon</b>: Your healing spells and abilities heal an additional 2 points of damage to each target. This does not affect healing conferred by magic items, nor does it add to fast healing or similar effects.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Favored Locations</b>: Altars, churches, sacred groves, shrines.</p><p><b>Influence Penalty</b>: Whether the spirit hopes to offer a chance for redemption or to sacrifice foes later on a dark altar, you must strike for nonlethal damage in combat whenever possible. You take a penalty equal to your spirit bonus on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks involving worshipers of faiths other than the spirit's, except checks to convince others to convert to the spirit's faith.</p><p><b>Taboos</b>: Choose one: you must strongly revere nature and may not wear metal armor or shields; you must follow a paladin or antipaladin code as appropriate for the spirit's deity; you may not deliberately speak any lies, including bluffing, exaggerating, stating half-truths with intent to deceive, lies by omission, and so on, and if you know the answer to a question that someone asks you, you must give the answer.</p><p><b>Divine Surge (Lesser, Su)</b>: This power functions as the archmage arcana spirit power, except that you add spells from the cleric/oracle list instead of the sorcerer/ wizard list (these spells count as divine), and you need a divine focus if the spell requires one.</p><p><b>Energy Font (Intermediate, Su)</b>: You can channel energy a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. Choose whether you channel positive or negative energy each time you contact a hierophant spirit; this choice must match the spirit's faith. If you choose positive energy, add <i>cure </i>spells of each level you can cast from the cleric list to your medium spell list and spells known. Otherwise, add <i>inflict </i>spells in the same way. These spells count as divine, as in the divine surge spirit power.</p><p><b>Overflowing Grace (Greater, Su)</b>: When you heal a creature to full hit points or a creature already at full hit points with your positive or negative energy, that creature gains a +1 sacred bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws for 1 round. The bonus is sacred if you use positive energy and profane if you use negative energy. If you destroy or kill one or more creatures with positive or negative energy, you gain a +1 bonus of the same type on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws for 1 round.</p><p><b>Legendary Hierophant (Supreme, Su)</b>: Once per day, you can request a minor miracle. This request must be in line with the options for <i>miracle </i>that don't cost powdered diamond. As usual for a <i>miracle</i>, the deity or other being the spirit worships can choose whether or not to grant the request at its whim.</p><h1>Marshal</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>A marshal spirit is a towering presence and an inspiration to others.</p><p><b>Spirit Bonus</b>: When you channel a marshal, your spirit bonus applies on Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks, as well as on spirit surge rolls. This allows the bonus to apply twice to the total result if you use a spirit surge on a Charisma check or on a Charisma-based skill check.</p><p><b>Seance Boon</b>: Choose a seance boon from any of the other legends to benefit from. When using the shared seance class feature, each participant can choose a different boon.</p><p><b>Favored Locations</b>: Council rooms, stages, theaters, throne rooms.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Influence Penalty</b>: The time you spend concentrating on your allies prevents you from attending to other important matters. You take a penalty equal to your spirit bonus on Wisdom checks and Wisdom-based skill checks. Additionally, if you are not at least nominally in charge of your present allies, you lose the marshal's spirit bonus and seance boon.</p><p><b>Taboos</b>: Choose one: you may not allow yourself or your allies to prevent a fleeing enemy from escaping, since an at-large villain makes a better tale (this applies only to enemies seeking to escape, not to those retreating to alert others or fight again from a better position); you may never leave an ally behind or allow yourself or your allies to sacrifice another ally, even a summoned creature; you must embrace any opportunity to spread the legend of yourself and your allies, even when a low profile would be helpful.</p><p><b>Marshal's Order (Lesser, Su)</b>: You can use your spirit surge on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, concentration checks, and skill checks rolled by you or any allies who participated in your seance as long as you have line of sight and line of effect, and are within 30 feet of the chosen ally. You can still use spirit surge only once per round.</p><p><b>Inspiring Call (Intermediate, Su)</b>: As a standard action, you can grant all allies who can see and hear you a competence bonus equal to your spirit bonus on either saving throws or attack and damage rolls. You choose which bonus to grant each time you use inspiring call. This ability lasts for 1 round. If you have the decisive strike greater spirit power, you can use inspiring call as a move action. If you have the legendary marshal supreme spirit power, you can use inspiring call as a swift action.</p><p><b>Decisive Strike (Greater, Su)</b>: You can allow the marshal to gain 1 point of influence over you as a swift action to allow an ally within 30 feet who can see and hear you to make a single melee or ranged attack during your turn. You can use this ability as a standard action to instead allow the ally to perform any standard action.</p><p><b>Legendary Marshal (Supreme, Su)</b>: You can use a lesser spirit surge without incurring influence. This lesser surge adds a maximum of 1d6 to the roll and does not apply your spirit bonus, regardless of other effects or abilities you have that alter your spirit surge. A lesser surge still counts as a spirit surge for the purpose of the limit of one spirit surge per round, but it does not consume any free uses of spirit surge you may have from effects such as taboo.</p><h1>Trickster</h1><p>A trickster spirit is a savvy and manipulative master of skills.</p><p><b>Spirit Bonus</b>: When you channel a trickster, your spirit bonus applies on Dexterity checks, skill checks, and Reflex saves.</p><p><b>Seance Boon</b>: Choose one skill when you gain this seance boon. You gain a +1 bonus on skill checks using that skill, and that skill counts as a class skill for you.</p><p><b>Favored Locations</b>: Alleys, mazes, taverns, trap-filled locations.</p><p><b>Influence Penalty</b>: The trickster within you is a protean manipulator, and you begin to see the possibility that everyone around you might have ulterior motives as well. You never count as an ally for the purpose of gaining benefits from another creature's abilities, nor do you count as a willing target for spells. Anyone attempting to target you with a touch range spell, even a beneficial spell, must succeed at a melee touch attack, though you need not attempt saving throws against harmless spells. You gain no benefit from another creature's aid another attempts, as you are too busy making sure they aren't secretly tricking or sabotaging you.</p><p><b>Taboos</b>: Choose one: you can't abide revealing your true identity, and you break this taboo when anyone pierces your disguise, even your own allies; you can never tell the truth; you can never pass up a more lucrative offer, even if it causes you to switch sides.</p><p><b>Trickster's Edge (Lesser, Su)</b>: Choose any two skills. These skills count as class skills for you, and you are treated as if you had an additional number of ranks in those skills equal to your medium level (to a maximum of your character level).</p><p><b>Surprise Strike (Intermediate, Su)</b>: When you attack an opponent that's denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, you deal 1d6 points of extra precision damage for every 3 medium levels. Your target counts as flat-footed against the first attack you make against that target in a day, regardless of abilities like uncanny dodge. After your first attack, that target is immune to being made flat-footed by your surprise strike for 24 hours.</p><p><b>Transfer Magic (Greater, Su)</b>: You can allow the trickster to gain 1 point of influence over you to make a melee touch attack against another creature as a standard action. If the attack succeeds, you randomly steal one of the harmless spells of the highest spell level active on that creature, ending the effect for the original creature and gaining all remaining duration for yourself. This ability does not work on personal-range or instantaneous- or permanent-duration spells.</p><p><b>Legendary Trickster (Supreme, Su)</b>: Once per day, instead of rolling for a skill check, you can choose your d20 result. Additionally, you gain the ability to change form at will as if using <i>greater polymorph</i>, except that you can mimic the form of a specific individual.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1occultclasses\">^Occult Classes</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypes\">Archetypes</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"xJQwjdwp4C0zgC2A"}

When a creature dies, its spirit flees its body and begins the next stage of its existence. Debilitating emotional attachments during life and other psychic corruptions cause some spirits to drift into the Ethereal Plane and descend toward the Negative Energy Plane. Some of these spirits are able to escape the pull of undeath and make their way back to the Material Plane, seeking refuge in a psychically attuned mind. Such a fusing of consciousnesses creates a spiritualist-the master of a single powerful phantom whom the spiritualist can manifest to do her bidding.</p><p><b>Role</b>: The spiritualist seeks the occult and esoteric truth about life, death, and the passage beyond, using her phantom as a guide and tool.

           <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>CLASS FEATURES</h1><p>The following are the class features of the spiritualist.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: A spiritualist is proficient with all simple weapons, kukris, saps, and scythes, as well as with light armor.</p><p><b>Spells</b>: A spiritualist casts psychic spells drawn from the spiritualist spell list (see page 76). She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell's level. To learn or cast a spell, a spiritualist must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a spiritualist's spell equals 10 + the spell level + the spiritualist's Wisdom modifier.</p><p>A spiritualist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-9: Spiritualist. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 on page 17 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>).</p><p>A spiritualist's selection of spells is limited. A spiritualist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the spiritualist's choice. At each new spiritualist level, she learns one or more new spells as indicated on Table 1-10: Spiritualist Spells Known. Unlike her number of spells per day, the number of spells a spiritualist knows does not affect her Wisdom score. The numbers on Table 1-10 are fixed.</p><p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third spiritualist level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a spiritualist can learn a single new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the spiritualist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spiritualist spell she can cast. A spiritualist can swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level.</p><p><b>Knacks</b>: A spiritualist learns a number of knacks, or 0-level psychic spells, as noted on Table 1-10 under Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they can be cast any number of times per day. Knacks prepared using another spell slot, because of metamagic feats applied to them, for example, consume spell slots as normal.</p><p><b>Phantom</b>: A spiritualist begins play with the aid of a powerful and versatile spirit entity called a phantom. The phantom forms a link with the spiritualist, who forever after can either harbor the creature within her consciousness or manifest it as an ectoplasmic or incorporeal entity. A phantom has the same alignment as the spiritualist, and it can speak all the languages its master can. A spiritualist can harbor her phantom in her consciousness (see the shared consciousness class feature on page 73), manifest it partially (see the bonded manifestation class feature on page 74), or fully manifest it. A fully manifested phantom is treated as a summoned creature from the Ethereal Plane, except it is not sent back to the Ethereal Plane until it is reduced to a negative amount of hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score.</p><p>A spiritualist can fully manifest her phantom through a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When the phantom is fully manifested, the spiritualist can change the form of the phantom's manifestation (either from ectoplasmic to incorporeal or vice versa) as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. When the phantom manifests, its hit points are unchanged from the last time it manifested, unless the phantom was slain and returned to the Ethereal Plane; in this case, the phantom manifests with half its maximum number of hit points.</p><p>The phantom does not heal naturally, and can be healed only with magic or by being tended to with the Heal skill while fully manifested in ectoplasmic form. The phantom stays fully manifested until it is either returned to the spiritualist's consciousness (a standard action) or banished to the Ethereal Plane. If the phantom is banished to the Ethereal Plane, it can't return to the spiritualist's consciousness or manifest again for 24 hours.</p><p>While fully manifested, a phantom can't be returned to the Ethereal Plane by means of <i>dispel magic</i>, but spells such as <i>dismissal </i>and <i>banishment </i>work normally. Whenever the spiritualist is unconscious or asleep, the phantom immediately returns to the spiritualist's consciousness. If the spiritualist dies, the phantom is returned to the Ethereal Plane, and can't return to the spiritualist's consciousness until 24 hours after the spiritualist is brought back to life. A phantom can't be dismissed or banished (by a spell or any other similar effect) while it resides in the spiritualist's consciousness, as the phantom is protected from such effects by the power of the spiritualist's psyche.</p><p>Fully manifested phantoms can wear armor and use items (though not wield weapons) appropriate to their forms. Any items worn, carried, or held by a phantom are dropped when the phantom returns to the spiritualist's consciousness, and must be retrieved and donned anew if the phantom wishes to use them when it fully manifests in the future.</p><p>Phantoms are self-involved, even jealous, creatures that do not play well with other summoned companions. A phantom refuses to manifest (either fully or as part of a bonded manifestation; see Bonded Manifestation on page 74) in the presence of an eidolon or shadow summoned by the phantom's master. Furthermore, if a phantom is manifested when such a creature is summoned, it immediately retreats into its spiritualist's consciousness, and will not manifest again until the eidolon or shadow is dismissed.</p><p>A fully manifested phantom's abilities, feats, Hit Dice, saving throws, and skills are tied to the spiritualist's class level and increase as the spiritualist gains levels. See the Phantoms section starting on page 78 for more information.</p><p><b>Shared Consciousness (Su)</b>: At 1st level, while a phantom is confined in a spiritualist's consciousness (but not while it's fully manifested or banished to the Ethereal Plane), it grants the spiritualist the Skill Focus feat in two skills determined by the phantom's emotional focus, unless the spiritualist already has Skill Focus in those skills. It also grants a +4 bonus on saving throws against all mind-affecting effects; at 12th level, this bonus increases to +8. Lastly, once per day, when the spiritualist fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, as an immediate action she can shunt that effect into the phantom's section of her consciousness instead. When she does so, she is not affected by the mind-affecting effect, but for the normal duration of that effect, the spiritualist loses the bonuses on saving throws against mind-affecting effects and the Skill Focus effects granted by her phantom, and can't use this ability to shunt a mind-affecting effect into the phantom's consciousness or manifest her phantom in any way. When a mind-affecting effect is shunted into the phantom's consciousness, spells such as <i>dispel magic </i>and <i>break enchantment </i>can be cast on the spiritualist to end the effect's duration as if the spiritualist were affected by the mind-affecting effect.</p><p><b>Etheric Tether (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a spiritualist can force the phantom to manifest in an area around her by pushing the phantom's consciousness though the veil of ethereal essence, allowing it to fully manifest in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form. Whenever her manifested phantom takes enough damage to send it back to the Ethereal Plane, as a reaction to the damage, the spiritualist can sacrifice any number of her hit points without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to the phantom. This can prevent the phantom from being sent back to the Ethereal Plane.</p><p>This tether is limited. When the phantom is fully manifested, it and the spiritualist must remain within 50 feet of one another for the phantom's manifestation to stay stable with little to no concentration on the part of the spiritualist. The spiritualist can stretch the limited tether, but only when the phantom is in ectoplasmic form. When a spiritualist starts her turn and her ectoplasmic phantom is more than 50 feet away from her (but closer than 100 feet), the spiritualist must concentrate on the link as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity or the ectoplasmic phantom immediately returns to the Ethereal Plane and cannot be summoned from that plane for 24 hours. This concentration can be interrupted as if it were a spell. Treat this effect's spell level as equal to 1 + 1 per 10 feet farther than 50 feet that the phantom is from the spiritualist (maximum spell level 6th). If the tether is interrupted or the check fails, the phantom immediately snaps back into the consciousness of its spiritualist master.</p><p>If the ectoplasmic phantom is ever more than 100 feet away from its spiritualist, or the incorporeal phantom is ever 50 feet away from the spiritualist or outside of line of effect from the spiritualist for more than 1 round per spiritualist level the spiritualist possesses, the tether is automatically broken; the phantom immediately returns to the Ethereal Plane and can't be summoned from that plane for 24 hours.</p><p>See the Phantoms section starting on page 78 for more information.</p><p><b>Bonded Senses (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, as a standard action, a spiritualist can share the senses of her manifested phantom, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and feeling everything her phantom does. She can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to her spiritualist level, but those rounds do not need to be consecutive. There is no maximum range for this effect, but the phantom and the spiritualist must be on the same plane. The spiritualist can end this effect as a free action.</p><p><b>Bonded Manifestation (Su)</b>: At 3rd level, as a swift action, a spiritualist can pull on the consciousness of her phantom and the substance of the Ethereal Plane to partially manifest aspects of both in her own body. When she does, she uses this bonded manifestation to enhance her own abilities while the phantom is still bound to her consciousness. For the spiritualist to use this ability, the phantom must be confined in the spiritualist's consciousness; it can't be manifested in any other way.</p><p>During a bonded manifestation, the phantom can't be damaged, dismissed, or banished. A spiritualist can use bonded manifestation a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + her spiritualist level. The rounds need not be consecutive. She can dismiss the effects of a bonded manifestation as a free action, but even if she dismisses a bonded manifestation on the same round that she used it, it counts as 1 round of use.</p><p>When a spiritualist uses this ability, she must choose either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form. When she makes this choice, she gains all of the abilities based on the form she chooses and her spiritualist level.</p><p><i>Ectoplasmic Bonded Manifestation</i>: When a spiritualist uses this ability and chooses ectoplasmic form, she gains an ectoplasmic shield that protects her without restricting her movement or actions. She gains a +4 shield bonus to Armor Class; this bonus applies to incorporeal touch attacks. The ectoplasmic shield has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance. At 8th level, the spiritualist also sprouts a pair of ectoplasmic tendrils from her body. Once per round as either a swift or a standard action (spiritualist's choice), the spiritualist can use one or both tendrils to attack creatures within her melee reach (using the attack bonus and damage dice of her ectoplasmic manifested phantom) or to manipulate objects. She can even use that action to have one tendril make an attack and the other manipulate an object, as long as that object can be manipulated with one hand. At 13th level, the phantom's ectoplasm clings to the spiritualist like a suit of armor. This grants the spiritualist a +6 armor bonus to AC without imposing an armor check penalty, an arcane spell failure chance, or any reduction in speed. At 18th level, the spiritualist can take a full-round action to attack all creatures within her melee reach with her tendrils (using the attack bonus and damage dice of her ectoplasmic manifested phantom). When she does, she rolls the attack roll twice, takes the better of the two results, and uses that as her attack roll result against all creatures within her melee reach. If the better attack roll threatens a critical hit, the spiritualist chooses one target that she hit to confirm the critical hit against. The other attacks that hit are considered normal hits rather than critical threats.</p><p><i>Incorporeal Bonded Manifestation</i>: When a spiritualist uses this ability and chooses incorporeal form, she becomes shrouded in a haze of insubstantial mist, granting her concealment against ranged attacks. At 8th level, the spiritualist can better affect incorporeal creatures with melee attacks; her unarmed strikes and melee weapon attacks are treated as if they had the <i>ghost touch </i>magic weapon special ability. At 13th level, the spiritualist can take a standard action to become invisible (as the <i>invisibility </i>spell) until the start of her next turn. At 18th level, the spiritualist gains the incorporeal subtype and a fly speed of 30 feet (good) while using this form of bonded manifestation.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Phantoms</h1><p>A phantom was once a sentient, living creature that experienced great turmoil in life or during death. The power of its emotional trauma ripped it from the flow of spirits rushing toward the Astral Plane and the fates beyond, pulling it through the Ethereal Plane and toward the Negative Energy Plane. During the decent to nothingness and undeath, the spirit was able to break free, and made its way back to the Material Plane to find shelter within the consciousness of a powerful psychic spellcaster. That fusion created a spiritualist.</p><p>Phantoms may retain some of their memories from life, but not many. Some phantoms wish to unburden themselves of their emotional shackles, while others just wish to continue existing while avoiding the corruption of undeath. Others still wish nothing more than to inflict their torment upon the living-taking their revenge on life for the horrors they faced during and after death.</p><p>Phantoms are powerful beings, but they are far more emotional than they are rational. Phantoms are still shackled by the emotions that created them, and spiritualists must maintain strong control over their phantoms to keep the phantom's often-violent emotions in check.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Spiritual Interference (Ex or Su)</b>: At 4th level, whenever a spiritualist is within the reach of her ectoplasmic manifested phantom, she gains a +2 shield bonus to her Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on her saving throws. She doesn't gain these bonuses when the ectoplasmic manifested phantom is grappled, helpless, or unconscious. A spiritualist within 30 feet of her incorporeally manifested phantom receives a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. This bonus is a supernatural ability and does not apply if the phantom is unconscious.</p><p><b>Detect Undead (Sp)</b>: At 5th level, a spiritualist's connection with the Ethereal Plane becomes so strong that she can use <i>detect undead </i>at will as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to her spiritualist level.</p><p><b>Phantom Recall (Su)</b>: At 6th level, as either a swift or an immediate action, a spiritualist can call her manifested phantom to her side or back into her consciousness. This ability functions as <i>dimension door</i>, using the spiritualist's class level as the caster level. When the spiritualist calls the phantom in this way, the phantom appears adjacent to the spiritualist (or as close as possible, if all adjacent spaces are occupied).</p><p>When the spiritualist uses this ability to call the phantom back to her consciousness, she can activate bonded manifestation as part of that action, but doing so costs 1 extra round of bonded manifestation.</p><p>The spiritualist can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 spiritualist levels she possesses beyond 6th.</p><p><b>Calm Spirit (Sp)</b>: At 7th level, a spiritualist gains the ability to use <i>calm spirit </i>(see page 160) as a spell-like ability once per day. At 11th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the spiritualist can use this ability an additional time per day (to a maximum of 4 times per day at 19th level).</p><p><b>See Invisibility (Sp)</b>: At 9th level, a spiritualist gains the ability to see many things normally hidden from sight. She gains the ability to use <i>see invisibility </i>as a spell-like ability once per day, with a duration of 10 minutes.</p><p><b>Fused Consciousness (Su)</b>: At 10th level, a spiritualist always gains the benefits of bonded senses when her phantom is manifested. She also gains the skill ranks and bonus to mind-affecting spells granted by the spirit's emotional focus (see page 80), even when her phantom is manifested. Lastly, she can shunt the effect of a mind-affecting effect into the consciousness of her phantom as the shared consciousness ability even when the phantom is manifested, but doing so causes the phantom to immediately retreat back into the spiritualist's consciousness.</p><p><b>Greater Spiritual Interference (Ex or Su)</b>: At 12th level, whenever allies are within the phantom's reach, as long as the manifested phantom is in ectoplasmic form, each ally gains a +2 shield bonus to its Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on its saving throws. For the spiritualist, these bonuses increase to +4. The spiritualist and allies within range don't gain this bonus if the manifested phantom is grappled, helpless, or unconscious. While the phantom is incorporeally manifested, allies within 30 feet of the phantom receive a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. For the spiritualist, this bonus increases to +4. This bonus doesn't apply if the phantom is unconscious.</p><p><b>Spiritual Bond (Su)</b>: At 14th level, a spiritualist's life force becomes intrinsically linked with the phantom's spiritual essence. As long as the phantom has 1 or more hit points, when the spiritualist takes damage that would reduce her to fewer than 0 hit points, those points of damage are transferred to the phantom instead. This transfer stops after the phantom takes all the points of damage or the phantom is reduced to a negative amount of hit points equal to its Constitution score. In the latter case, points of damage dealt in excess of this limit are dealt to the spiritualist. This ability affects only effects that deal hit point damage.</p><p><b>Call Spirit (Sp)</b>: At 16th level, a spiritualist gains the ability to use <i>call spirit </i>(see page 160) as a spell-like ability once per day.</p><p><b>Dual Bond (Su)</b>: At 17th level, the spiritualist can use her bonded manifestation ability a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + twice her spiritualist level.</p><p><b>Empowered Consciousness (Su)</b>: At 20th level, while a spiritualist's phantom is confined in her consciousness, she is immune to mind-affecting effects and spells and effects that involve possession, such as <i>magic jar </i>and <i>possession </i>(see page 181).</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1occultclasses\">^Occult Classes</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypes\">Archetypes</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"z6qXi7IEHh26yONZ"}

This effect counts as a 6th-level spell with the light descriptor.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Burning Infusion</h1><p><b>Element </b>fire; <b>Type </b>substance infusion; <b>Level </b>1; <b>Burn </b>1</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>blue flame, fire, magma, plasma</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Reflex negates</p><p>Your kinetic blast ignites your foes. Whenever an infused blast hits a foe and penetrates its spell resistance, that foe catches on fire, regardless of whether it takes damage. A foe that catches fire takes 1d6 points of fire damage each round until the fire is extinguished. Against a creature on fire from this infusion, any fire kinetic blasts gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls, to DCs, and on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Chain</h1><p><b>Element </b>air; <b>Type </b>form infusion; <b>Level </b>5; <b>Burn </b>3</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>electric</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none</p><p>Your electric blast leaps from target to target. When you hit a target with your infused blast, you can attempt a ranged touch attack against an additional target that is within 30 feet of the first. Each additional attack originates from the previous target, which could alter cover and other conditions. Each additional target takes 1d6 fewer points of damage than the last (for example, 3d6 becomes 2d6), and you can't chain the blast back to a previous target. You can continue chaining your blasts until a blast misses or fails to deal damage, or until your blast is reduced to a single damage die.</p><h1>Chilling Infusion</h1><p><b>Element </b>water; <b>Type </b>substance infusion; <b>Level </b>5; <b>Burn </b>3</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>blizzard, cold, ice</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Fortitude negates</p><p>Your kinetic blast chills your foes to the bone, making their movements sluggish.

You can center this 20-foot-radius spread anywhere within 120 feet of you. All creatures and objects within the cloud when you create it automatically take 1/4 the normal amount of damage from your blast with no saving throw. Any time a creature enters the cloud, it takes half the normal amount of damage from your blast, as do creatures that end their turns in the cloud. Your cloud obscures vision as <i>obscuring mist</i>. It lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier or until you use the cloud infusion again.</p><h1>Cyclone</h1><p><b>Element </b>air; <b>Type </b>form infusion; <b>Level </b>4; <b>Burn </b>3</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>air, blizzard, sandstorm, thunderstorm</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Reflex half</p><p>You create a circular rush of wind. All creatures and objects within a 20-foot-radius burst centered on you take half your blast's normal amount of damage. The saving throw DC is Dexterity-based.</p><h1>Deadly Earth</h1><p><b>Element </b>earth; <b>Type </b>form infusion; <b>Level </b>6; <b>Burn </b>4</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>extended range</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>earth, magma, metal, mud</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none</p><p>You infuse the ground in a 20-foot radius anywhere within 120 feet of you on an earthen surface (if you are using a metal blast, this infusion affects a metal surface instead). The ground roils and buckles beneath the affected area. All creatures and objects in contact with the ground within the area when you create it automatically take 1/4 of the normal damage from your blast with no saving throw. Any time a creature enters the area, it takes half the normal damage from your blast, as do creatures that end their turns in the area. The entire area counts as difficult terrain. This infusion lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier or until you use it again.</p><h1>Disintegrating Infusion</h1><p><b>Element </b>aether; <b>Type </b>substance infusion; <b>Level </b>6; <b>Burn </b>4</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>force</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Fortitude partial; see text</p><p>You can use force to rip your targets apart. Against creatures, your kinetic blast deals double its normal amount of damage, but targets receive a saving throw to reduce the damage to half the blast's normal amount of damage (for a total of 1/4 of the blast's increased damage). Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by the blast is disintegrated, as the spell <i>disintegrate</i>. You can use the infused blast to destroy force effects or objects as <i>disintegrate</i>, but for each force effect or 10-foot cube of nonliving matter you destroy in this way, you must accept 1 point of burn, which can't be reduced by effects such as infusion specialization or gather power.</p><h1>Draining Infusion</h1><p><b>Element </b>universal; <b>Type </b>substance infusion; <b>Level </b>1; <b>Burn </b>1</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>any simple</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Fortitude partial; see text</p><p>You can drain elemental energy and matter from your foes to strengthen your next attack. When you use this infusion, your kinetic blast affects only creatures with a subtype matching your kinetic blast's element (for instance, a fire blast would damage only creatures of the fire subtype). Against such creatures, your blast targets touch AC (if it requires an attack roll) and always allows spell resistance. Because you are draining energy from the target, your blast doesn't apply your elemental overflow bonuses or Constitution modifier. The target can attempt a Fortitude save to take 1/4 the normal amount of damage. Draining infusion ignores any damage reduction, resistances, and immunities the creature might possess. If at least one creature fails its saving throw against your draining infusion, you can reduce the total burn cost of any one blast wild talent used before the end of your next turn by 1, or by 2 if you have the supercharge ability. If you use draining infusion again before applying this reduction, you still deal the damage from that draining infusion, but the burn reductions don't stack.</p><h1>Entangling Infusion</h1><p><b>Element </b>earth or water; <b>Type </b>substance infusion; <b>Level </b>2; <b>Burn </b>2</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>blizzard, cold, earth, ice, magma, metal, mud, sandstorm</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Reflex negates</p><p>Your kinetic blast surrounds your foes in elemental matter. Whenever a blast with this infusion deals damage to a foe, that foe becomes entangled for 1 minute. The foe can remove this condition as a standard action with a successful Escape Artist or Strength check (with the same DC as for saves against your kinetic blast) or by dealing an amount of damage to the entangling matter equal to double your kineticist level (the matter has hardness 0). If the foe was already entangled by this infusion and fails its save against a second instance of this infusion, the increased amount of elemental matter fuses to the ground, causing the foe to be rooted in place as though anchored to an immobile object.</p><h1>Eruption</h1><p><b>Element </b>fire; <b>Type </b>form infusion; <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>2</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>extended range</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>blue flame, fire, magma, steam</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Reflex half</p><p>Your kinetic blast erupts from the ground in a pillar centered anywhere within 120 feet of you. The pillar affects all creatures and objects in a 10-foot-radius cylinder that extends 40 feet above the ground. An energy blast infused with eruption deals its normal damage to each target, while a physical blast deals half its normal amount of damage. The saving throw DC is Dexterity-based.</p><h1>Explosion</h1><p><b>Element </b>fire; <b>Type </b>form infusion; <b>Level </b>7; <b>Burn </b>4</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>extended range</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>blue flame, fire</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Reflex half</p><p>You focus your energy on a point in space and create a controlled explosion. You can center the explosion anywhere within 120 feet of you, and you can choose the radius of the spread to be 5, 10, 15, or 20 feet. All creatures and objects within the explosion take your blast's damage. The saving throw DC is Dexterity-based.</p><h1>Extended Range</h1><p><b>Element </b>universal; <b>Type </b>form infusion; <b>Level </b>1; <b>Burn </b>1</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>any</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none</p><p>Your kinetic blast can strike any target within 120 feet.</p><h1>Extreme Range</h1><p><b>Element </b>universal; <b>Type </b>form infusion; <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>2</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>extended range</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>any</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none</p><p>Your kinetic blast can strike any target within 480 feet.</p><h1>Fan Of Flames</h1><p><b>Element </b>fire; <b>Type </b>form infusion; <b>Level </b>1; <b>Burn </b>1</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>blue flame, fire</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Reflex half</p><p>Your kinetic blast extends in a fan of flames, damaging all creatures and objects in a 15-foot cone. The saving throw DC is Dexterity-based.</p><h1>Flash Infusion</h1><p><b>Element </b>fire; <b>Type </b>substance infusion; <b>Level </b>4; <b>Burn </b>3</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>blue flame, fire, plasma</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates</p><p>Your kinetic blast is so bright that it blinds your foes. Whenever an infused blast hits a foe and penetrates its spell resistance, that foe must succeed at a Will save or be blinded for 1 round, regardless of whether it takes damage from the blast. You can reduce the blast's damage by half to increase the DC of this save by 2.</p><h1>Flurry Of Blasts</h1><p><b>Element </b>universal; <b>Type </b>form infusion; <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>2</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>extended range</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>any</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none</p><p>Instead of a single kinetic blast, you shoot two kinetic blasts at targets within 120 feet that each deal damage as if your kineticist level were 1st (effects or abilities that increase your kinetic blast's damage don't apply). At 10th level, you can shoot three blasts with flurry of blasts; this increases to four blasts at 16th level and to five blasts at 20th level. If you are under the effect of <i>haste </i>or similar magic that increases your number of attacks in a full-attack action, the number of kinetic blasts in your flurry of blasts increases by 1.</p><p>No two targets can be more than 30 feet apart. You must assign the targets of all your blasts before rolling any of the attacks. Any blast beyond the first that hits the same target adds 1d6 points of damage; bonuses and penalties to damage don't apply. If you are using a substance infusion that requires a saving throw, a target attempts its save only once (even if it was hit multiple times), but it takes a penalty on the save equal to the number of times it was hit beyond the first. If you are using a substance infusion that requires a caster level check or combat maneuver check, you roll the check only once against each target, but you gain a bonus on the check equal to the number of times that target was hit beyond the first. If you are using the pushing substance infusion, the maximum distance of the push increases by 5 feet for each time the target was hit beyond the first.</p><h1>Foe Throw</h1><p><b>Element </b>aether; <b>Type </b>form infusion; <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>2</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>telekinetic</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Fortitude negates; see text</p><p>Your telekinetic blast can throw a Large or smaller creature instead of an unattended object; you can increase the burn cost by 1 to affect a creature of a larger size. If the creature you attempt to throw succeeds at a Fortitude save, it negates the blast entirely. Otherwise, if your blast hits, both the thrown creature and the target take the full amount of damage from your telekinetic blast, and the thrown creature falls prone in the last unoccupied space along its path. If your blast misses, the thrown creature can choose to occupy any space within 30 feet of the target, it doesn't fall prone, and it takes half the normal amount of damage from your blast. The movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.</p><h1>Force Hook</h1><p><b>Element </b>aether; <b>Type </b>form infusion; <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>2</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>force</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none</p><p>Your force blast hooks onto its target and drags you adjacent to it. This effect functions as <i>force hook charge(</i>UM), except with the range and damage of your force blast.</p><h1>Fragmentation</h1><p><b>Element </b>earth or water; <b>Type </b>form infusion; <b>Level </b>7; <b>Burn </b>4</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>extended range</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>earth, ice, metal</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none or Reflex half; see text</p><p>You throw a volatile sphere of solid matter that shatters into countless shards. Attempt a ranged attack roll against a target within 120 feet. If you hit, the target takes your kinetic blast damage with no saving throw. All other creatures and objects within a 20-foot burst take half the normal amount of damage and can attempt a Reflex save to reduce that damage by half again. If the attack misses its target, the blast has no effect. The saving throw DC is Dexterity-based.</p><h1>Grappling Infusion</h1><p><b>Element </b>universal; <b>Type </b>substance infusion; <b>Level </b>5; <b>Burn </b>3</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>any</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none</p><p>Your cloud, deadly earth, or wall blast grows tendrils that hold your enemies in place. Whenever a creature takes damage from the infused blast, you can attempt a combat maneuver check to have the blast grapple that opponent. Your bonus on this check is equal to 2 + your kineticist level + your Constitution modifier (treat the blast as a Huge creature). The blast only grapples opponents; it can't perform other functions of grapple maneuvers such as pinning or moving the opponent. If the blast is already grappling an opponent, it receives a +5 bonus on its combat maneuver check to maintain the grapple, as normal. You can use this infusion only if you also use the cloud, deadly earth, or wall form infusion.</p><h1>Gusting Infusion</h1><p><b>Element </b>air; <b>Type </b>substance infusion; <b>Level </b>1; <b>Burn </b>1</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>air, blizzard, sandstorm, thunderstorm</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Fortitude negates</p><p>The wind from your infusion causes your blast to act as an instantaneous <i>gust of wind</i>. If your blast has a clear path, you can accept 2 additional points of burn or reduce the damage to 0 in order to cause the <i>gust of wind </i>effect to persist for 1 round along that path.</p><h1>Impale</h1><p><b>Element </b>earth or water; <b>Type </b>form infusion; <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>2</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>earth, ice, metal</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none</p><p>You extend a long, sharp spike of elemental matter along a line, impaling multiple foes. Make a single attack roll against each creature or object in a 30-foot line, starting with the closest target. If the result is a critical threat, roll to confirm against only the first target you hit. Calculate damage against each target you hit, starting from the closest. If your attack hits a target but fails to deal physical damage to that target, the spike fails to penetrate and the infused blast doesn't continue. A blast with the impale infusion can penetrate solid barriers, but it must deal enough damage to destroy the barrier in order to continue through. Infused earth and metal blasts always deal piercing damage.</p><h1>Kinetic Blade</h1><p><b>Element </b>universal; <b>Type </b>form infusion; <b>Level </b>1; <b>Burn </b>1</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>any</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none</p><p>You form a weapon using your kinetic abilities. You create a non-reach, light or one-handed weapon in your hand formed of pure energy or elemental matter. (If you're a telekineticist, you instead transfer the power of your kinetic blast to any object held in one hand.) The kinetic blade's shape is purely cosmetic and doesn't affect the damage dice, critical threat range, or critical multiplier of the kinetic blade, nor does it grant the kinetic blade any weapon special features. The object held by a telekineticist for this form infusion doesn't prevent her from using gather power.</p><p>You can use this form infusion once as part of an attack action, a charge action, or a full-attack action in order to make melee attacks with your kinetic blade. Since it's part of another action (and isn't an action itself), using this wild talent doesn't provoke any additional attacks of opportunity. The kinetic blade deals your kinetic blast damage on each hit (applying any modifiers to your kinetic blast's damage as normal, but not your Strength modifier). The blade disappears at the end of your turn. The weapon deals the same damage type that your kinetic blast deals, and it interacts with Armor Class and spell resistance as normal for a blast of its type. Even if a telekineticist uses this power on a magic weapon or another unusual object, the attack doesn't use any of the magic weapon's bonuses or effects and simply deals the telekineticist's blast damage. The kinetic blade doesn't add the damage bonus from elemental overflow.</p><h1>Kinetic Fist</h1><p><b>Element </b>universal; <b>Type </b>form infusion; <b>Level </b>1; <b>Burn </b>1</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>any</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none</p><p>You surround your body with energy or elemental matter from your kinetic abilities. You can use this form infusion as part of an attack action, a charge action, or a full-attack action to add damage to each of your natural attacks and unarmed strikes until the beginning of your next turn. Since kinetic fist is part of another action, using this wild talent doesn't provoke any additional attack of opportunity. You deal an additional 1d6 points of damage per 3 dice of your kinetic blast's damage (minimum 1d6), and this damage is of the same type as your kinetic blast's damage. This extra damage ignores spell resistance and doesn't apply any modifiers to your kinetic blast's damage, such as your Constitution modifier.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Kinetic Whip</h1><p><b>Element </b>universal; <b>Type </b>form infusion; <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>2</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>kinetic blade</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>any</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none</p><p>You form a long tendril of energy or elemental matter. This functions as kinetic blade but counts as a reach weapon appropriate for your size. Unlike most reach weapons, the kinetic whip can also attack nearby creatures. The kinetic whip disappears at the beginning of your next turn, but in the intervening time, it threatens all squares within its reach, allowing you to make attacks of opportunity that deal the whip's usual damage.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>Magnetic Infusion</h1><p><b>Element </b>air or earth; <b>Type </b>substance infusion; <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>2</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>charged water, electric, metal, plasma, thunderstorm</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none</p><p>Your kinetic blast causes your foes to become mildly magnetic. Whenever an infused blast deals damage to a foe, attacks made with metal weapons (including metal kinetic blasts) against that foe receive a +4 bonus until the end of your next turn, and the foe takes a -4 penalty on Reflex saving throws to avoid metallic objects.</p><h1>Many Throw</h1><p><b>Element </b>aether; <b>Type </b>form infusion; <b>Level </b>8; <b>Burn </b>4</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>extended range</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>telekinesis</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none</p><p>You grab a large number of objects and throw them all at once. You can use your telekinetic blast to make attack rolls against a number of targets equal to your kineticist level within 120 feet, but no two targets can be more than 30 feet apart.</p><h1>Mobile Blast</h1><p><b>Element </b>universal; <b>Type </b>form infusion; <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>2</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>any</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>Reflex negates</p><p>You send an elemental mass, energy ball, or object into a particular square within 30 feet, dealing 1/4 the normal amount of damage (or half the normal amount of damage, for an energy blast) to all creatures in that square. The mobile blast lasts until you dismiss it as a free action, lose consciousness, or move farther than 30 feet from it. Each round on your turn as a move action, you can move the mobile blast to another square within range; either way, it continues to deal damage to all creatures in its final square each round if they fail their saving throws. You can have only a single mobile blast in existence at a time. If the mobile blast's total burn cost before applying any reduction for gather power is 0, it has no maximum duration. Otherwise, it lasts for a maximum number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier, and afterward you can't create another mobile blast for a number of minutes equal to the number of rounds it existed. A mobile blast is always extremely loud and visible. The saving throw DC is Dexterity-based.</p><h1>Pure Flame Infusion</h1><p><b>Element </b>fire; <b>Type </b>substance infusion; <b>Level </b>7; <b>Burn </b>4</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>blue flame</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none</p><p>You open a direct conduit to the purest elemental fire and send it surging forth.

Attempt a bull rush combat maneuver check against each target damaged by your infused blast, using your Constitution modifier instead of your Strength modifier to determine your bonus. This infusion can push a foe back by a maximum of 5 feet. You can increase the burn cost of this infusion to increase the maximum distance pushed by 5 feet per additional point of burn accepted. You can't use this infusion with a form infusion such as cloud that causes your kinetic blast to lack a clear direction to push.</p><h1>Quenching Infusion</h1><p><b>Element </b>water; <b>Type </b>substance infusion; <b>Level </b>1; <b>Burn </b>1</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>charged water, water</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none</p><p>Your blast puts out nonmagical fires as if they had been touched by a water elemental.

The metal you create with this infusion crumbles away shortly thereafter and has no gp value.</p><h1>Snake</h1><p><b>Element </b>universal; <b>Type </b>form infusion; <b>Level </b>3; <b>Burn </b>2</p><p><b>Prerequisite </b>extended range</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>any</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none</p><p>You have fine control over your kinetic blast, allowing you to alter its path to avoid obstacles.

Whenever your infused blast hits a foe and penetrates its spell resistance, you can attempt a caster level check as if using a targeted <i>dispel magic </i>before determining whether the foe takes damage from the blast. You can choose to reduce the blast's damage by half to increase your bonus on the caster level check by 2. If you don't choose a specific spell effect to attempt to dispel, you automatically attempt to dispel effects that would protect the target from fire damage before other spells.</p><h1>Wall</h1><p><b>Element </b>universal; <b>Type </b>form infusion; <b>Level </b>5; <b>Burn </b>3</p><p><b>Associated Blasts </b>any</p><p><b>Saving Throw </b>none</p><p>You create a wall of churning elements, flensing debris, or roiling energy.

All creatures and objects in one of the wall's squares when you create it take 1/4 the normal damage from your blast with no saving throw (or half the normal damage for an energy blast). Anytime a creature crosses the wall, it takes half the normal damage from your blast (or full damage for an energy blast). The wall is not completely solid, but it does provide cover against attacks from the other side of the wall. The wall lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier or until you use a wall infusion again.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter1occultclasses\">^Occult Classes</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypes\">Archetypes</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"zC1pX7mkurAuhQMp"}
