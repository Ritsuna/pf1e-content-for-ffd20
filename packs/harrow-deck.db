Select the nine cards with that ability.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Conduct a choosing. Have each player draw a role card from the nine cards. Record the character names and their role cards on the back of a Harrowing Chronicle, as shown on the sample Chronicle card. Make notes of several events in the adventure where a player's role card suggests an appropriate effect.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Shuffle all of the cards and conduct a spread. Use the front of the Harrowing Chronicle to record the cards you drew. When a card of import (a role card or a match) appears, select an encounter in which it will be meaningful, and write this on the Chronicle. Note if true (T), partial (P), or opposite (O) matches occur. You don't need to record an encounter for every card. When you begin one of the chosen encounters, apply the effects of that encounter's card to the encounter. You can download extra Harrowing Chronicles at <b>paizo.com.</b></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>A Sample Adventure:</b> Take a look at the filled-in sample Chronicle card. The GM is running an adventure in which his players are defending a castle from orc invaders. On the back of the Chronicle, the GM noted that Harsk's player drew The Keep, and the GM decided that Harsk gains an advantage when defending the walls of the castle. While conducting the spread, The Avalanche appeared in the lower left corner (a true match), so the GM has decided that card will affect an upcoming battle at a drawbridge - he notes to himself that the bridge will collapse while the characters are defending it. The Forge, Seelah's role, is an opposite match, so something big awaits Seelah at an armory the PCs will visit.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<linklist>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>@JournalEntry[Jm023RHyMAAvDRNt]Art: Sample Cronicle Card\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></linklist>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</text>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"worlds/Tyrants-Grasp/Harrow%20Deck%20Deluxe/images/Sample.jpg\"/><text type=\"formattedtext\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Making the Harrow Work for You</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Consider these two notes when using the Harrow in your game.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Reading the Cards for Evil Characters:</b> When doing readings for evil folks, you might want to do a \"reverse reading.\" In this type of reading, you interpret negative cards as being bad for the evil character's foes, and positive cards as positive for the character's foes.

Others waste their time gambling with the cards. A select few actually know the art of reading the Harrow deck.

This merely scratches the surface of how to use the deck, but it will allow you to use the deck to glean important information about yourself and those you encounter.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Before you conduct a reading, set the stage for a dramatic encounter. Clear the table, and place the deck in front of you.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The reading is conducted in two parts: first you'll perform the choosing, and then you'll perform the spread.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h1>The Choosing</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Ask your subjects - those who come to you for a reading - what they seek. Phrase the request in the form of a single question, then decide which of the six following abilities best suits that question. For example, a question of health might indicate the Constitution cards, while a question regarding love might indicate the Charisma cards. Ultimately, it is up to you to choose which ability most fits.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</text>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"worlds/Tyrants-Grasp/Harrow%20Deck%20Deluxe/images/Abilities.jpg\"/><text type=\"formattedtext\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<linklist>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>@JournalEntry[WWTuSrRmcxkhhnAA]Art: Abilities\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></linklist>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Remove the nine cards of the ability you have chosen from the Harrow deck and shuffle those nine. Spread the cards you chose facedown in front of you. Have your subjects each pick one card. The chosen card has a message for that person about his current place in the world and in relation to the question at hand. Using the descriptions on pages 17-28, interpret each card to define that subject's role for the upcoming series of events.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If this card should appear in the spread that follows, it applies most strongly to the person who chose that role and should be interpreted accordingly.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h1>The Spread</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Once each person knows his or her role, shuffle all the cards together (including those just chosen) and then lay out a spread <i>facedown.</i> The spread is laid out in a threeby three grid of nine cards.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>When interpreting the cards, each one's placement in the spread determines whether it relates to the past, present, or future. The placement also tells the harrower if the card should be interpreted in a positive, unclear, or negative light. The following table shows the placements and their alignments and meanings:</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<table>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td></td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td><b>Lawful</b></td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td><b>Neutral</b></td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td><b>Chaotic</b></td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td><b>Good</b></td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>positive past</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>positive present</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>positive future</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td><b>Neutral</b></td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>unclear past</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>unclear present</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>unclear future</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td><b>Evil</b></td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>negative past</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>negative present</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>negative future</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</table>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Any cards in the top (good) row are interpreted in a positive light, while cards in the middle (neutral) row are unclear, and cards in the bottom (evil) row are interpreted negatively. Likewise, the lawful column represents the past, the neutral column denotes the present, and the chaotic column signifies the future.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>For example, a card in the upper left placement refers to something in the past that was positive. A card in the lower middle placement indicates something negative in the present.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Reading the Cards</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Turn over and read the cards one column at a time. Each column relates to a different period in the subjects' lives.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Placement:</b> The left column refers to past actions or events that affect the current situation. The middle column refers to actions or events that might happen now or in the very near future that affect the current situation. The right column refers to actions or events in the future that might happen to the subjects. The future can change, of course, but the results can give insight into what might be.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Turn all of the cards in the past column faceup first. Examine the cards according to the rules below, selecting one or more cards to interpret. After you finish with the past, turn the cards over in the present column. When you finish with the present, go on to the column representing the future. Select the cards to interpret in each column by looking for role cards and cards that relate to their placement in one of three ways, called matches.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Role Cards:</b> Whenever a role card that was chosen by one of the subjects appears in a spread, it must be interpreted, because it is of great import to that subject.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>True Matches:</b> A true match occurs whenever a card appears in its \"correct\" placement in the spread (that is, in the placement corresponding to the position of its alignment symbol on the card). For example, if the lawful good card The Paladin is in the upper left corner of the spread, that's a true match. Interpret the card based on its general meaning (see pages 16-28).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Opposite Matches:</b> An opposite match occurs when a card is in the placement diametrically opposed to its alignment. Thus, if The Juggler (chaotic good) is in the lower left placement (lawful evil), that's an opposite match. Interpret the card based on the opposite of its general meaning.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Partial Matches:</b> A partial match occurs if a card matches only the correct row or column, but not both. So if The Cricket (neutral good) is found in the upper right placement (chaotic good), it is a partial match (matching good only). Interpret the card based on its general meaning, but with some aspect of its meaning altered (at your discretion).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Selecting Cards to Interpret:</b> You can interpret any number of cards in a column, but you must interpret at least one per column. All role cards, true matches, and opposite matches are always interpreted. If none of those appear in the column, look for a partial match. If that doesn't appear, then choose any one card in the column.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Cards in Misaligned Placements:</b> If a good card, such as The Trumpet, appears in the bottom row, you should interpret it in its most negative light (see card descriptions for more details). Likewise, if an evil card, such as The Beating, appears in the top row, it should be given a positive interpretation. These cards are considered misaligned. (Cards which are neither good nor evil are never misaligned.)</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>When cards appear in the middle row, interpret them normally, unless the context of the reading suggests you should treat them as misaligned. Once you've interpreted each column, the reading is over.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</text>\n\t\t\t\t\t"}

Riana thinks on what type of question this is, and decides that it best fits Charisma.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>She takes the nine Charisma cards out of the deck and carefully shuffles them for the choosing. She then spreads them out, facedown, in front of her. Kyra takes one and turns it over - it is The Empty Throne. Riana tells Kyra that this role card represents her place in relation to the question. Kyra is a link to the past, a connection to her mother's former husband - Kyra's father. He was lost in a war some years earlier, but his body was never found.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>With that done, Riana puts all of the Charisma cards back into the deck and shuffles. She then deals out nine cards, facedown, in the three-by-three pattern of the spread. Riana starts by turning over the three cards in the left column - those that represent the past. The cards revealed are, from top to bottom, The Owl, The Marriage, and The Cricket.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Riana checks to see if there are any true matches in this column. There is one: appropriately enough, The Marriage. It is a lawful neutral card in the lawful neutral placement in the spread. Riana contemplates the meaning of this card to the question. Since Kyra's question is about a wedding, the card is especially meaningful. Riana tells Kyra that this card represents her mother's first marriage to her father. Although her father is gone, that relationship has a powerful effect on the one her mother is now forming with her new fiance. Since there are no other true matches, Riana moves on.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>She turns over the three cards in the middle column, representing the present. Top to bottom, she sees The Unicorn, The Dance, and The Tangled Briar. None of the cards are true matches or opposite matches. Thus, Riana looks for partial matches to read. She finds two. The Unicorn matches the good aspect of the top middle space, while The Tangled Briar matches the evil in the lower middle space. Riana looks at The Unicorn and tells Kyra that the marriage has the potential of bringing her mother great happiness. The Tangled Briar says that someone very important to the marriage has a secret that must come out, though. If it doesn't, the secret might eventually ruin the marriage.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>With that, Riana turns over the final three cards in the spread, those representing the future. Here she finds, top to bottom, The Tyrant, The Mute Hag, and The Keep. She finds no true matches, but there is one exact opposite: The Tyrant, a lawful evil card in the chaotic good placement. The Tyrant in this placement is misaligned, and indicates a tyrant overthrown. In this case, Riana believes it means that Kyra and her mother will likely be able to get past their grief for her father and make the most of the new marriage, but only if the poisonous secret indicated by The Tangled Briar in the present is cleared up.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKyra vows to find out this secret and release its poison. Riana smiles.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</text>\n\t\t\t\t\t"}
