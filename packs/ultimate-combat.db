Because duels are always planned and expected, there is never a surprise round. Alternatively, some duels start off with each side facing off, waiting for the other to flinch or break resolve. In such cases, substitute a Bluff, Intimidate, or Sense Motive check in place of the standard initiative check. The skill used is decided by the individual participants and is reflective of their approach to the duel.</p><p>At the beginning of each round, the participants check the status of the duel (the GM may want to mark the beginning of each round in some way during initiative tracking as a reminder to check this status). So long as all participants agree to continue dueling, the duel goes on. If any one of the participants withdraws from the duel, the duel immediately ends for all participants, even those who would see it continue. The participant or side that ended the duel is considered the loser of the duel. The duel's remaining participants can, among themselves, agree to resume the duel, but this is considered a separate duel from the previous one and does not involve those who withdrew from the duel.</p><p>Each participant in a duel can act normally on his turn, but his actions must target or affect either himself or one of the other duel participants (either an ally or an opponent). For example, a warrior might make an attack with his bow against anyone participating in the duel, or he might administer a potion to a wounded ally also involved in the duel, but he could not attack anyone other than a participant. Similarly a dueling wizard could not cast haste on allies outside the duel while excluding himself, but he could cast it on his allies if he was among the targets. The same goes for offensive spells, such as fireball-the dueling caster must include one of his opponents in the duel among the targets of the spell, and could not affect some nearby creatures to the exclusion of his opponent.</p><p>In addition to his normal actions, each participant in a duel may use one of a number of special immediate actions, available only to characters participating in a duel.

The following are the rules for how a vehicle acts in the combat round.</p><p><b>Initiative:</b> A vehicle moves on its driver's initiative. If a driver delays or readies an action, the vehicle goes out of control, and does nothing except take the uncontrolled action until it stops or someone becomes its new driver.</p><p><b>Movement:</b> At the start of the driver's turn, she makes a driving check to control the vehicle as detailed in the Driving Vehicles section. When doing so, she takes whatever action is required before doing anything else that turn.</p><p>Vehicles usually ignore difficult terrain due to rubble and foliage, but treat steep inclines as difficult terrain, and depending on the vehicle type and GM judgment, they may be affected by other difficult terrain types as well.</p><p>Vehicles and creatures that occupy vehicles can enter the spaces of other vehicles and creatures, though doing so usually provokes a vehicular overrun or ramming maneuver (see Vehicle Combat Maneuvers on page 177). A vehicle can even end its turn in the space of a creature or another vehicle.</p><p><b>Threatening:</b> Vehicles cannot threaten areas, but their non-crew occupants can. A character driving a vehicle still threatens the squares around her, though she may have limited options for attack depending on the requirements of the device used to drive the vehicle. Creatures used as propulsion do not threaten areas, and are treated as part of the vehicle for purposes of vehicular combat maneuvers.</p><p><b>Line of Sight and Cover:</b> Vehicles typically grant their occupants partial cover (+2 to AC and +1 on Reflex saving throws) against those outside the vehicle, and may grant partial cover against opponents within the vehicles as well. Vehicles with more protection or internal chambers can offer greater cover and can even block line of sight.</p><p><b>Jumping On or Off a Vehicle:</b> Jumping on a vehicle is a normal jump of its distance assuming the vehicle has a deck or handholds within the character's height from the ground. Increase the DC of the Acrobatics check by 5 for every 30 feet of the vehicle's current speed. If the jumping creature is on a moving vehicle, calculate the increase in the Acrobatics skill check DC by calculating the difference between the current speeds of the two vehicles. For every difference of 30 feet (round up), the DC increases by 5.</p><p>For example, jumping onto a vehicle with a current speed of 90 feet increases the DC by 15 if the jumper is not also on a moving vehicle. If the jumper is on a moving vehicle, and that vehicle is moving at the same current speed as the vehicle the jumper wants to jump to, there is no increase to the DC. If the difference between their speeds is less than 30 feet, the DC of the Acrobatics check increases by 5. If it's between 30 and 60, it increases by 10, and so on.</p><p>Jumping off a vehicle onto the ground is considered a fall, and treated as if the fall were an additional 10 feet farther for every 30 feet of the vehicle's movement for the purposes of determining damage. Acrobatics can be used to soften this fall, and magic abilities such as feather fall can be used to negate the effects of jumping off a vehicle.</p><p><b>Taking Control of a Vehicle:</b> If a vehicle has no driver, any creature can take control of the vehicle as long as the creature is within the driving space of the vehicle and makes a driving check as a free action. The vehicle's driver can always give over control to another adjacent creature that is within the driving space of the vehicle as a free action. When a new creature becomes the driver, the vehicle moves on the new driver's turn, but not on the new driver's first turn after taking control of the vehicle.</p><p>If a creature wants to take control of a vehicle from another forcefully, it must pull the driver off the controls as part of a grapple and take over the driving device as part of a pin. When a creature successfully pins a vehicle's driver, it can choose to end the grapple immediately. When it does, the creature moves the current driver 5 feet to any unoccupied space within the vehicle (this movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity) and becomes the vehicle's new driver.</p><p><b>Attacks against Vehicles:</b> A vehicle has a base Armor Class based on its size and other defenses the vehicle has. To calculate the vehicle's actual AC, add the current driver's driving skill modifier (or Wisdom modifier, if it is using that ability to drive the vehicle) to the vehicle's base AC. Touch attacks against a vehicle ignore its driver's driving skill or ability modifier; thus a vehicle's base AC is its touch AC. A vehicle is never considered flat-footed.</p><p>A vehicle has a base saving throw listed in its stat block. This determines its base Fortitude and Reflex saving throw. A vehicle is immune to effects that require a Will saving throw (though drivers, crew members, passengers, and creatures providing muscle propulsion typically are not). To determine the vehicle's actual Fortitude and Reflex saving throws, add half the driver's driving skill modifier (or half the driver's Wisdom modifier) to the vehicle's base saving throw.</p><p>Vehicles have hit points, but do not have ability scores, and are immune to ability score damage or drain. They are also immune to bleed damage. A vehicle that takes damage in excess of half its total hit points gains the broken condition. When a vehicle reaches 0 or fewer hit points, but has not yet reached negative hit points equal to the number of squares of its space, it is wrecked. When a vehicle reaches a negative number of hit points equal to the number of squares it takes up, it is destroyed (see Damaging a Vehicle on page 179).</p><p>Unlike other objects, vehicles do not take half damage from energy attacks, but do take half damage from all ranged weapons except siege weapons.</p><p>When attacking a vehicle, you can attack the vehicle's structure, occupant, propulsion, driving device, or conveyance (if any).</p><p><i>Attacking the Structure:</i> This is an attack against the vehicle itself. If successful, the vehicle takes damage normally.</p><p><i>Attacking an Occupant:</i> This is a normal attack against an occupant creature. Occupants get partial cover or greater if the attack is coming from outside of the vehicle. Grappling the driver is one method for taking control of the vehicle.</p><p><i>Attacking Propulsion:</i> Propulsion often has its own set of statistics, while creatures propelling a vehicle use their own statistics. Other types of propulsion have hit points and hardness determined by multiplying the values listed in the Propulsion Devices sidebar by the vehicle's total number of squares of that type. Individual vehicle stat blocks also detail their propulsion.</p><p>If a vehicle is being pulled by creatures, and any of those creatures is killed, dazed, stunned, or becomes unconscious, the vehicle comes to a sudden stop (see Sudden Stops on page 180). If a vehicle has a crew, and half or more of that crew is killed, dazed, stunned, or rendered unconscious, the vehicle can no longer be controlled.</p><p><i>Attacking the Driving Device:</i> A driving device is its own object with its own statistics. When a driving device gains the broken condition or is disabled, all driving checks are increased by 10. When a driving device is destroyed, the vehicle can no longer be driven. Driving devices are typically objects with object immunities and resistances.</p><p><i>Attacking Conveyance:</i> An attack against wheels, rudders, or similar forms of conveyance takes a -10 penalty on the attack roll, but does maximum damage to the vehicle (no roll necessary). If the attack is a critical hit, multiply this maximum damage by the critical multiplier of the attack. Conveyances are typically objects with object immunities and resistances.</p><h1>TABLE: DRIVING DEVICES</h1><p>The following are some of the typical driving devices for vehicles, plus their usual Armor Class, hit points, and hardness. A broken driving device increases the driving check of the vehicle by 10. When a driving device is destroyed, a vehicle cannot be driven until the driving device is repaired.</p><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Driving Device</b></td><td><b>AC</b></td><td><b>Hit Points</b></td><td><b>Hardness</b></td></tr><tr><td>Reins</td><td>14</td><td>10</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Rigging</td><td>9</td><td>5 per square of sail</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Steering Wheel</td><td>10</td><td>25</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Throttle</td><td>12</td><td>15</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Rudder</td><td>10</td><td>25</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Magically Treated</td><td>-</td><td>×2</td><td>×2</td></tr></table><p><b>Vehicle Combat Maneuvers:</b> Vehicles typically don't have attacks, though some can be fitted with siege weapons (see page 177). A vehicle can make, and is often required to make, a vehicular bull rush, vehicular overrun, or ramming maneuver as part of its movement. Unlike creatures, a vehicle can enter the space of creatures or objects smaller than it, and when it does, it makes either a vehicular overrun or vehicular bull rush. When a vehicle hits a creature or a vehicle that is its size or larger, or it hits a solid object (a wall or structure that is immobile and has a hardness of 5 or more), it makes a ramming maneuver.</p></text>\n            <img src=\"worlds/Fresh/Pathfinder%20Ultimate%20Combat/images/Aerial%20Attack.jpg\"/><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><i>Vehicular Overrun:</i> Any time any part of a vehicle (including any creatures used as propulsion) enters the space of a creature or vehicle smaller than it, the driver must make a vehicular overrun combat maneuver against the creature or vehicle. This may require the driver to make vehicular overrun checks against the same creature numerous times as new parts of the vehicle enter its square.</p><p>When performing a vehicular overrun, the driver uses the base CMB of the vehicle plus her driving skill modifier (or Wisdom skill modifier if she is using that ability to drive the vehicle) as the CMB of the vehicular overrun. If the driver has feats that improve her CMB when overrunning, like the Improved Overrun feat, she may also add those modifiers and benefits to the vehicular overrun. Like a normal overrun, this action provokes an attack of opportunity from the creature being overrun, unless the driver has the Improved Overrun feat. The creature being overrun can make this attack of opportunity on any part of the vehicle that is within reach.</p><p>When a vehicular overrun is attempted, the target of the overrun may choose to avoid the vehicle, allowing the vehicle to pass through its space without requiring a vehicular overrun maneuver check. The creature or vehicle cannot avoid a maneuver check if the driver has the Improved Overrun feat, the vehicle is two or more size categories larger than the target, or the target creature is confused, dazed, entangled, flat-footed, helpless, paralyzed, prone, or stunned. If the target does not avoid the vehicle, make the combat maneuver check as normal. If the maneuver is successful, the vehicle moves through the target's space, and the target of the overrun takes the vehicle's ramming damage (see Table 4-3 for base ramming damage by size, and individual vehicle stat blocks for their own ramming damage). If the driver's combat maneuver check exceeds the target's CMD by 5 or more, the target takes twice the vehicle's ramming damage. If the target is a creature, it is also knocked prone. If the target has more than two legs, it gets a +2 bonus to its CMD for each additional leg it has. Vehicles that are overrun are knocked prone if the opposing driver's combat maneuver check result exceeds the vehicle's CMD by 10 or more. A vehicle that is knocked prone makes a sudden stop (see Sudden Stops on page 180).</p><p>It takes at least 5 full-round actions and a DC 25 Strength check from creatures adjacent to the vehicle to push a Large land or water vehicle up from being prone. For every size category that the vehicle is larger than size Large, increase the number of full-round actions by three and the Strength check DC by 5.</p><p>The driver of a prone air vehicle must succeed at a DC 25 Fly check immediately to avoid falling.</p><p>A vehicle equipped with a ram deals +2d8 points of damage with a vehicular overrun.</p><p><i>Vehicular Bull Rush:</i> As a swift action, taken when the driver takes all but the \"uncontrolled\" action while driving the vehicle, a driver can choose to substitute all or some of her vehicular overruns with vehicular bull rush maneuvers until the end of the vehicle's movement that turn. A vehicular bull rush pushes a creature or a vehicle away without doing harm. If the driver does not have the Improved Bull Rush feat or a similar ability, initiating a vehicular bull rush provokes an attack of opportunity from the creature being bull rushed with the vehicle.</p><p>If the bull rush is successful, the target of the bull rush is pushed 5 feet away from the vehicle. If you succeed at the check for the vehicular bull rush by 5 or more, you can deal the vehicle's ramming damage to the creature. For every 5 by which your attack exceeds your opponent's CMD, you push the target an additional 5 feet away. A creature being moved by a vehicular bull rush does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless the driver possesses the Greater Bull Rush feat. You cannot bull rush a creature or vehicle into a square that is occupied by an object (including a vehicle). If there is another creature in the way of a bull rush, the driver must immediately make a combat maneuver check to bull rush that creature, taking a -4 penalty on this check for each creature being pushed beyond the first. If successful, the driver can continue to push the creature or vehicle a distance equal to the lesser result.</p><p><i>Ramming:</i> Any time any part of a vehicle (including any creatures used as propulsion) enters the space of a creature or vehicle of its size or larger, or the space of a solid sturdy object (like a wall or a building) no matter the size of that object, it makes a ramming maneuver against that creature or object. There is no maneuver check for a ramming maneuver; its effects happen automatically. When a vehicle makes a ramming maneuver against a creature or an object, the vehicle deals its ramming damage to the creature or object, and the vehicle takes half that damage. The base amount of damage that a ramming vehicle does and takes is determined by its size (see Table 4-3).</p><p>When a vehicle makes a ramming maneuver against a solid object, to determine how much damage both the solid object and the vehicle take, allow the vehicle to enter the solid object's space. The vehicle will only travel through that space if the damage is enough to destroy the solid object; in all other cases the vehicle takes the damage and then comes to a sudden stop directly in front of the solid object.</p><p>When a vehicle makes a ramming maneuver against a creature, a nonsolid object, or another vehicle, it can enter the space of the object or the creature, and even end its move within that space.</p><p>A vehicle can have a ram or similar ramming device on its forward facing. If it does, it ignores the damage for the first square it enters of a solid object, and all squares for other objects and creatures. A ram can be added to a Large vehicle for 50 gp, a Huge vehicle for 100 gp, a Gargantuan vehicle for 200 gp, and a Colossal vehicle for 400 gp. A vehicle cannot have a ram if it uses muscle propulsion (pulled).</p><p>If a vehicle is being pulled by a creature or creatures when the vehicle takes damage due to a ramming maneuver, the creatures that are pulling it are damaged as well, and are knocked prone. A successful Reflex saving throw (DC 10 + 1 for every 10 feet of the speed the vehicle was moving when it hit the vehicle, structure, or creature) halves the damage and the creatures pulling it are not knocked prone.</p><p>If the vehicle making the ramming maneuver is a muscle-propelled (pulled) vehicle, the creatures pulling the vehicle attempt to avoid making a ramming maneuver. If a ramming maneuver is imminent, those creatures decelerate at a rate of up to twice their acceleration as an immediate action or attempt to swerve out of the way (automatically moving diagonally to avoid the vehicle or structure even if they were not driven to do so), avoiding the vehicle or structure if possible. The driver chooses which of these options occurs. A skilled driver can attempt to force the creature to continue the ramming maneuver, but doing so requires a DC 30 Handle Animal, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check, depending on the type and intelligence of the creature. The driver makes this check as an immediate action when the creature tries to decelerate or swerve out of the way.</p><h1>TABLE 4-3: RAMMING DAMAGE BY SIZE</h1><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Vehicle Size</b></td><td><b>Damage</b></td></tr><tr><td>Large vehicle</td><td>1d8</td></tr><tr><td>Huge vehicle</td><td>2d8</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan vehicle</td><td>4d8</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal vehicle</td><td>8d8</td></tr></table><p><b>Damaging a Vehicle:</b> Vehicles have hit points and hardness based on their primary components. Most vehicles are made of wood. Heavier construction materials are possible, but they at least double the number of squares of propulsion a vehicle requires. Materials like stone or heavy metals quadruple the number of squares of propulsion needed.</p><p>A vehicle has a total number of hit points equal to its base material hit point value times its vehicle's number of squares (see Table 4-4). When it is reduced to below half hit points, it becomes broken. When it reaches 0 hit points, it becomes wrecked. When it reaches negative hit points equal to its number of squares, it is destroyed-it is so damaged it cannot even be used for scrap material.</p><h1>TABLE 4-4: VEHICLE HIT POINTS BY MATERIAL</h1><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Material</b></td><td><b>Hit Points per Square</b></td><td><b>Hardness</b></td></tr><tr><td>Leather</td><td>10</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Wood</td><td>15</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Stone</td><td>20</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Metal</td><td>20</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Magically treated</td><td>×2</td><td>×2</td></tr></table><p><i>Broken Condition:</i> Vehicles, and sometimes their methods of propulsion, are objects, and like any other object, when they take damage in excess of half their hit points, they gain the broken condition. When a vehicle gains the broken condition, it takes a -2 penalty to AC, on saving throws, and on combat maneuver checks, and the DC to drive the vehicle increases by 2. If a vehicle or its means of propulsion becomes broken, both the maximum speed and the acceleration of the vehicle are halved until repaired. If the vehicle is in motion, and is traveling faster than its new maximum speed, it automatically decelerates to its new maximum speed.</p><p><i>Wrecked Condition:</i> A vehicle gains the wrecked condition if its hit points are reduced to 0 or fewer. A wrecked vehicle cannot be driven and gains the sinking condition (if in the water) or falls (if in the air). An air vehicle that begins to fall does so at a rate of half its maximum speed each round.</p><p>If a means of propulsion is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it does not gain the wrecked condition. It is instead destroyed.</p><p><i>Sinking:</i> A water vehicle that is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points or a vehicle that is not seaworthy that is plunged into water gains the sinking condition. For a water vehicle, this condition ends when a vehicle is brought to 1 or more hit points, but other vehicles must be removed from the water. A sinking ship fully sinks and is destroyed 10 rounds after gaining the sinking condition. Each additional hit on a sinking ship reduces the remaining time for it to sink by 1 round. Alternatively, when a water vehicle is reduced to a negative number of hit points equal to its number of squares, it sinks immediately.</p><p><i>Destroyed:</i> A vehicle is destroyed when it is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its number of squares. A destroyed vehicle cannot be repaired, and is nothing more than junk.</p><p>If a vehicle's means of propulsion is an object, it is destroyed when it reaches 0 hit points.</p><p>If either the means of propulsion or the vehicle is destroyed, it comes to a sudden stop if it is not stopped already. Water vehicles sink and drop to the bottom of the body of water. Air vehicles fall.</p><p><b>Sudden Stops:</b> When a vehicle comes to a sudden stop-its movement is reduced to 0 in some way other than the driver using a drive action to slow the vehicle-both creatures and items on the vehicle are violently pushed toward the vehicle's forward facing a number of squares equal to 1/2 the vehicle's current speed before it came to the sudden stop. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. At the end of this movement, creatures and objects take 1d6 points of damage, and creatures must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex saving throw or be knocked prone. If the movement pushes creatures or objects into solid objects, that creature or object takes an additional 1d6 points of damage for each 5-foot square the push was reduced by the solid object.</p><p>For instance, if a vehicle with a movement of 60 feet makes a sudden stop due to hitting a brick wall, its driver is thrown 30 feet toward the brick wall. If the brick wall was only 5 feet away from the driver at the point of impact, the driver moves forward 5 feet, hits the wall, and takes 5d6 points of damage. She then takes the original 1d6 points of damage, after which she makes a Reflex saving throw to see if she falls prone for the sudden stop.</p><p><b>Repairing a Vehicle:</b> The fastest and easiest way to repair a vehicle is with the mending and make whole spells, but more mundane methods can also be used. Craft (carpentry) can be used to repair most vehicles made of wood; because of their specialized construction, water vehicles require Craft (ships) to repair. Depending on the nature of the damage, such skills like Craft (cloth), Craft (alchemy), Knowledge (engineering), and even various professions can be used to repair vehicles, if the GM approves. In general, a day's worth of work by a single person using the appropriate skill to repair a vehicle requires 10 gp of raw material and a DC 10 skill check, and repairs 10 points of damage on a success, or 5 hit points on a failure.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"0V37BbrYgS8K1P3c"}

To perform this trick, the companion must be able to fly, and it must be outdoors or someplace with enough room for the bird to fly great distances in (a grand cathedral may have enough room, but dungeons usually do not). It spends a full-round action flying to a high vantage point, and on the next round makes a charge attack upon an enemy the falconer designates. If that charge attack hits, the bird deals 2d4 points of damage instead of 1d4 with its bite and gains a ×4 critical modifier when making the attack. If the bird hits, the target is staggered for 1 round.</p><p>This ability replaces the combat style feat the ranger gains at 6th level.</p></text>\n            <img src=\"worlds/Fresh/Pathfinder%20Ultimate%20Combat/images/Falconer.jpg\"/>","_id":"27tuM1e7YKaaJbFL"}

The smaller or better guarded the area, the more difficult the called shot. A called shot is a single attack made as a full-round action, and thus can't be combined with a charge, feats like Vital Shot, or multiple attacks with a full-attack action.</p><p>Called shots are divided into three basic difficulty groups: easy, tricky, and challenging. Easy called shots represent large areas of the body, and are made at a -2 penalty. They have relatively minor effects unless a critical hit is scored or massive damage is dealt. Tricky called shots represent either smaller areas, like a hand, or areas a creature protects well, like its head. Tricky shots receive a -5 penalty, and inflict more serious consequences. Challenging called shots represent very small areas like eyes, fingers, or creatures' necks. They receive a -10 penalty, and successful hits cause significant short-term impairment. Beyond these challenging ratings lie almost impossible called shots that receive a -20 penalty. For called shots against non-humanoid creatures, use common sense and the categories above as guidelines. For example, a flying creature's wings are treated as arms.</p><p><b>Range and Reach:</b> Called shots work best at close range. Melee called shots are at a -2 penalty if the target isn't adjacent to its attacker. For called shots made at range, all range penalties due to range increment are doubled, with a minimum penalty of -2 for any called shot against a target that's not within 30 feet.</p><p><b>Critical Hits and Critical Threats:</b> A called shot has the normal chance for a critical hit, and inflicts an extra effect if one is confirmed. The exact effects of a successful critical hit depend on where the target was hit, and are described under Called Shot Effects.</p><h1>Table 5-4: Called Shot Locations</h1><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td colspan=\"3\"><b>Location</b></td><td colspan=\"3\"><b>Type</b></td><td colspan=\"3\"><b>Penalty</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Head</td><td colspan=\"3\">Tricky</td><td colspan=\"3\">-5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">Ear</td><td colspan=\"3\">Challenging</td><td colspan=\"3\">-10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">Eye</td><td colspan=\"3\">Challenging</td><td colspan=\"3\">-10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">Neck</td><td colspan=\"3\">Challenging</td><td colspan=\"3\">-10</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Chest</td><td colspan=\"3\">Easy</td><td colspan=\"3\">-2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">Heart</td><td colspan=\"3\">Challenging</td><td colspan=\"3\">-10</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Vitals</td><td colspan=\"3\">Tricky</td><td colspan=\"3\">-5</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Arm</td><td colspan=\"3\">Easy</td><td colspan=\"3\">-2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\">Hand</td><td colspan=\"3\">Tricky</td><td colspan=\"3\">-5</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Leg</td><td colspan=\"3\">Easy</td><td colspan=\"3\">-2</td></tr></table></text>\n            ","_id":"2Ou0SN91VaNOrs7y"}

Called shots to the leg are easy (-2 penalty).</p><p><b>Called Shot:</b> A called shot to a leg lowers the target creature's speed by 10 feet for 1d4 rounds if it has two or fewer legs, and by 5 feet if it has three or four legs. In either case, the creature's speed cannot be reduced below 5 feet per round. Called shots to the leg have no effect on creatures with five or more legs. Hitting the same leg more than once has no extra effect, but the speed penalty for hits on different legs stack. Additionally, any skill or ability checks involving movement (such as Acrobatics or Swim checks) take a -2 penalty for 1d4 rounds.</p><p><b>Critical Called Shot:</b> A critical hit to the leg deals 1d4 points of Dexterity damage and knocks the target prone. A successful Fortitude save keeps the creature from falling prone. The creature also suffers the effects of a called shot to the leg for 1d4 minutes.</p><p><b>Debilitating Blow:</b> A debilitating blow to the leg knocks the creature prone. The blow renders the leg entirely useless until healed unless the target succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the leg is severed or otherwise mangled such that only regeneration or similar effects can repair it. If the save succeeds, the target is instead lamed and moves at half speed until the leg is healed, or until it receives a successful DC 20 Heal check. A creature with a useless or severed leg moves at half speed if it still has more than half of its legs usable; otherwise, it cannot stand up and must crawl to move.

The audience can bolster or demoralize the competitors with their enthusiasm or scorn for what they see on the battlefield, with serious results.</p><p>A crowd's attitude is similar to a nonplayer character's attitude when a character uses the Diplomacy skill. The DC of performance combat checks to improve crowd reaction is tied to the crowd's starting or current attitude. Each time the combatants do something spectacular on the battlefield, they have the opportunity to parlay that success into a better crowd reaction, but missteps can also create contempt among the crowd.</p><p>During performance combat, it is important for the GM to keep track of the crowd's attitude toward each side of the combat. Given that a crowd is filled with many people shouting, clapping, booing, hissing, or otherwise showing their pleasure or displeasure, the exact crowd reaction changes from moment to moment based on events on the battlefield, but groups of combatants always have a reasonable idea of what the crowd thinks of their performance at any given time.</p><p>The following are the general categories of crowd reaction and attitude. They are listed from lowest regard to highest.</p><p><b>Hostile:</b> The crowd does not like what it is seeing. Hostile crowds demoralize combatants in a performance combat. In these battles, while the crowd is hostile toward a given side, those combatants take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p><p>If the crowd is hostile toward a side of the combat and a member of that side fails a performance combat check by 5 or more, that side automatically loses the performance part of the combat. This can be important for the story of the game, or if the PCs are participating in serialized performance combats.</p><p><b>Unfriendly:</b> While still biased against a side, the crowd reserves its most vocal disdain for failed performance combat checks. Unfriendly crowds demoralize combatants in a performance combat. In these battles, while the crowd is unfriendly toward a given side, those combatants take a -1 penalty on all attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p><p><b>Indifferent:</b> The crowd is waiting for something exciting to happen. Audience members show little emotion other than anticipation and a desire for daring feats of combat to occur.</p><p><b>Friendly:</b> The crowd is beginning to be swayed toward one side in the fray. Audience members cheer when that side achieves some impressive feat in the combat, and their reaction grants a +1 morale bonus on all attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws for their chosen side. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p><p><b>Helpful:</b> The crowd loves what it is seeing from a given side. Audience members stand up, chant, cheer, and scream for the combatants to push on toward ultimate success. A helpful crowd grants its chosen champions a +2 morale bonus on all attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p><p>If the crowd is helpful toward one side of the combat and a member of that side succeeds at a performance combat check, that side gains a victory point.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"4BsXUlA9VpuQvlLX"}

In the case of effects like the heal spell, where a spell or effect heals 10 hit points per caster level, the creature heals its caster level in wound points.</p><p>For instance, if a 12th-level cleric uses her channel positive energy power to replenish wound points to living creatures, she would typically heal 6 wound points for all living creatures with her channel energy burst. If she casts the heal spell, she would restore 12 wound points to the creature touched.</p><p><b>Rest:</b> When a creature has a full night's rest (8 hours of sleep or more), that creature regains all its vigor points and 1 wound point. If there is a significant interruption during a rest, the creature regains neither wound points nor vigor points. If a creature undergoes complete bed rest for an entire day, it regains half its level in wound points and all its vigor points.</p><p><b>Restoration and Similar Effects:</b> When a creature regains Constitution points by way of the restoration spell or a similar effect, that creature regains 2 wound points for every Constitution point regained. Relieving a Constitution penalty or Constitution drain regains any wound points that were lost from that penalty or drain.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"4e4TXWa139aybQMN"}

Creatures pull chariots and wagons. Boats and ships are propelled by water currents, wind, muscle, or all three forces. Fantastical airships are held aloft by a variety of propulsion sources, both magical and mundane. The method of propulsion typically affects the speed and maneuverability of a vehicle, but more importantly, a vehicle's propulsion determines the required skill needed to control a vehicle. The following are the general methods of vehicle propulsion, along with what skills are typically needed to drive such vehicles.</p><p><b>Alchemical:</b> Rarely, an alchemical engine may propel a vehicle. Powered by steam or more volatile gases and reagents, a vehicle with an alchemical engine requires either a Knowledge (arcana) or Craft (alchemy) check to be driven. The base DC to drive an alchemical vehicle is 10 higher than normal. Alchemical engines can be extremely powerful, with the ability to propel vehicles hundreds of times their size. They can also be very fickle when driven by creatures uninitiated in the secrets of alchemy.</p><p>When a driver makes a driving check to control an alchemically propelled vehicle with a Wisdom check or a skill she is not trained in and rolls a natural 1, the vehicle's alchemical engine gains the broken condition. When it gains the broken condition, the vehicle's maximum speed and acceleration are both halved, and if the vehicle is currently moving at a rate faster than its new maximum speed, it immediately slows to that speed.</p><p><b>Current:</b> From canoes and large ships to winged gliders, vehicles propelled by currents typically manipulate an already existing power source within or outside of nature- an air current, a water current, or more exotic currents, like conduits of magical energy. Usually, manipulating a current-propelled vehicle requires a skill like Fly, Knowledge (nature), Profession (sailor), Survival, or even Acrobatics or Knowledge (arcana), depending on the nature or makeup of the vehicle and the current the vehicle is manipulating.</p><p><i>Water Current:</i> Vehicles that only rely on currents of water for their propulsion are somewhat limited. These vehicles can only move in the direction and at the speed of a current unless they also employ some other means of propulsion or manipulation, and thus often have an additional form of propulsion, such as muscle in the case of a canoe, and wind in the case of a galley. A current-driven ship such as a river barge with a crew of two or more creatures requires either a Profession (sailor) or Knowledge (nature) check for the driving check, as ships require precision, discipline, and knowledge of the natural world. Smaller water-current vehicles, like canoes, use the Survival skill as the drive skill, as reading the terrain is a very important aspect of maintaining control over those types of vehicles.</p><p>If it moves with the current, a water-current vehicle's maximum speed depends on the speed of the current (often as high as 120 feet). The acceleration of a water-current vehicle is 30 feet.</p><p><i>Air Current:</i> Air-current vehicles are rather diverse. They can be sailing ships, airships, land ships, or even gliders. A vehicle propelled by air with a crew of two or more creatures requires a Profession (sailor) or Knowledge (nature) check as its driving check. Because of their complexity, air-current vehicles always have their driving check DCs increased by 10. Smaller air-current vehicles, such as gliders and wind sleds, use Acrobatics or Fly instead. Much of their control depends on knowledge of flight or proper movements of the body to control the vehicle.</p><p>Smaller vehicles (size Large or smaller) can move at a speed of 60 feet, can move at twice that amount when they are moving with the air current, and have an acceleration of 30 feet. Larger vehicles can move at a speed of 90 feet, or twice that amount when they are moving with the air current, and have an acceleration of 30 feet.</p><p><i>Weird Current:</i> Navigating currents of magical energy, burning magma, or the murky rivers of the Shadow Plane could use a number of skills, but likely use skills similar to those needed to operate water-current and air-current vehicles. Weird-current vehicles always have their driving check DCs increased by 10, and sometimes by 15 in more exotic locales and conditions.</p><p>Weird-current vehicles typically move at the speed of water or air currents, depending on their nature, but have been known to move twice or even triple those speeds.</p><p><b>Magic:</b> Magic provides some of the most powerful and easy-to-use methods of propelling a vehicle, such as an elemental-powered juggernaut or an airship with an arcane device at its heart. Often simply identifying the properties of the magic item providing propulsion gives a creature the ability to use it, but sometimes more complicated magical devices require Spellcraft or Use Magic Device to drive properly.</p><p><b>Muscle:</b> From a chariot to a slave ship filled with captive rowers, moving a vehicle powered by muscle is all about getting a creature or creatures to push, pull, or otherwise propel the vehicle. Based on the type and intelligence of the creatures moving the vehicle, checks for driving muscle-propelled vehicles can use a diverse number of skills, including, but not limited to, Diplomacy, Handle Animal, Intimidate, and Profession (driver).</p><p>Muscle-propelled vehicles come in two forms: pulled and pushed.</p><p><i>Pulled:</i> This type of propulsion involves one or more creature pulling a vehicle. Unless the creature pulling the vehicle is intelligent (Intelligence score of 3 or higher), either Handle Animal or Profession (driver) is used for the driving check (driver's choice). Intelligent creatures must be convinced with a Diplomacy check (decrease the driving check by 5 if the creature or creatures have the helpful attitude), or forced with an Intimidate check. Forcing an intelligent creature to pull a vehicle increases the DC by 20.</p><p>A creature can pull a number of vehicle squares equal to the number of squares in the creature's space to a top speed equal to twice the creature's speed. It can accelerate its space in vehicle squares up to its speed. For instance, a single horse takes up 4 squares, and can pull a 4-square cart 100 feet each round with an acceleration of 50 feet.</p><p><i>Pushed:</i> Pushed vehicles are the exact opposite of pulled vehicles-vehicles that are pushed by muscle, usually using some form of device manipulated by crew members. Aquatic vehicles are the most likely to be pushed. Lines of rowers use their oars to push the vehicle forward, or a pair of cloud giants may churn a propeller at the aft end of a dirigible. Driving checks for pushed vehicles tend to be Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Handle Animal, depending on the intelligence and attitude of the creatures supplying the muscle for the propulsion.</p><p>For intelligent creatures, use Diplomacy if the creatures providing the propulsion have an attitude of indifferent, friendly, or helpful (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 94). Decrease the Diplomacy driving check by 5 if the creatures providing the propulsion are friendly. Intimidate is used for intelligent creatures with an attitude of unfriendly or hostile. Handle Animal is used if the creatures providing the propulsion are not intelligent.</p><p>A creature that is pushing a vehicle with the proper mechanical help can push between 5 times to 20 times its space in vehicle squares.</p><p>The maximum speed and acceleration of a muscle-propelled vehicle depends on the mechanism used to assist the pushing-see the sample vehicle statistics for examples.</p><p><b>Mixed Methods of Propulsion:</b> Large and complicated vehicles, such as large sailing ships, often use multiple forms of propulsion. Sometimes multiple methods add flexibility, but often they work in concert to create faster movement. A vehicle with multiple methods of propulsion often requires a large crew to get it going and keep it moving. If a vehicle has two methods of propulsion, it uses its fastest speed and acceleration and then adds half the speed and acceleration of the second-fastest propulsion.

They tend to move in the direction of their forward facing, and do so quickly.</p><p><b>Facing:</b> Unlike creatures, most vehicles have a forward facing. The facing of the vehicle determines its best path of propulsion. Vehicles are very good at moving in the direction of their forward facing, but it takes time and skill to move them in other directions. A horse-pulled wagon moves forward quickly and with ease, but turning a corner requires proper timing and a crack of the whip. A ship propelled by an air current can take a great deal of effort to stop, especially once it has reached top speed. Vehicle facing represents the effect of inertia on vehicles.</p><p>When driven correctly, vehicles can move straight ahead, diagonally, or a mix of both within the same movement. Skilled drivers can make a vehicle zigzag in a forward direction with ease.</p><p><b>Movement:</b> Vehicles have a maximum speed and an acceleration listing. The speed is the fastest rate the vehicle can travel. When a creature or creatures pull a vehicle, the vehicle's maximum speed is equal to twice the speed of the creature providing the propulsion, and its acceleration is the creature's speed. (Teams of mixed creature types use the slowest creature's speed.) A vehicle cannot start at its maximum speed, unless it has some form of high-level magic propulsion. Each round, the driver can attempt to accelerate the vehicle or decelerate it by a rate equal to its acceleration (see Driving Vehicles below). The rate at which a vehicle is currently moving is called its current speed.</p></text>\n            <img src=\"worlds/Fresh/Pathfinder%20Ultimate%20Combat/images/Maneuvering%20a%20Vehicle.jpg\"/>","_id":"6fcBW7TlHLQYeHrf"}

Early firearms are muzzle-loaded, requiring a bullet and powder (or other special alchemical substances) to be shoved down the barrel before the weapon is fired. Early firearm ammunition can be loaded from a cartridge, but that cartridge is made of soft material (like paper or cloth) that is torn open so that the contents may be shoved down the barrel.</p><p><b>Blunderbuss:</b> This weapon fires pellets or a bullet from its trumpet-shaped barrel, making it an effective fowling weapon or close-fighting personal defense weapon. The blunderbuss fires in a 15-foot cone when firing pellets, and has a 10-foot range increment when firing a bullet. A blunderbuss uses a bullet or pellets and a single dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition.</p><p><b>Buckler Gun:</b> The front of this buckler is fitted with a small, double-barreled gun that can be shot while wearing the buckler. Unlike with a double-barreled pistol, you can only shoot one barrel at a time. You must remove the buckler to reload the gun. Each barrel of a buckler gun uses a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. Because of its awkward construction, a buckler gun is always considered an off-handed weapon.</p><p><b>Culverin (Hand Bombard):</b> The culverin, also known as a hand bombard, consists of a simple smoothbore tube, sealed at one end except for a small hole used to ignite a gunpowder charge. A wooden stock partially encases the barrel, allowing the wielder to hold it under his arm with relative ease when carrying it. Firing a culverin without support (such as a wall, a window, or a stand) imparts a -4 penalty on the attack rolls, and the wielder is knocked prone. A culverin uses 4 doses of black powder and grapeshot. Note that these statistics simulate only the original, hand-held culverins-their larger descendants are considered cannons and are dealt with in the section on siege weapons.</p><p><b>Double Hackbut:</b> This double-length rifle uses a pair of trunnions to mount its barrel into a swiveling mechanism fastened to a lightweight, two-wheeled carriage. It takes a full-round action to set up the carriage. The carriage has a hind leg, allowing the wielder to wheel the device about and immediately prop it for stability during combat. Unlike other two-handed firearms, you must fire the double hackbut while it is mounted, or else firing it imparts a -4 penalty on attack rolls and the recoil knocks the wielder prone. A Large or larger creature can fire a double hackbut one size smaller than it is without its mounting as a normal two-handed weapon and without the danger of being knocked prone, but takes the normal penalty for firing an inappropriately sized weapon.</p><p><b>Fire Lance:</b> This primitive firearm is nothing more than a long tube that, when ignited, propels a short gout of flame and a javelin. Unlike other firearms, the fire lance is wildly imprecise, and targets AC rather than touch AC. A fire lance is always treated as having the broken condition for the purpose of determining the effects of a misfire. A fire lances uses a javelin and 2 doses of black powder as ammunition.</p><p><b>Musket:</b> This long-barreled firearm has a much greater range than a pistol. A musket uses either a bullet and a single dose of black powder or an alchemical cartridge as its ammunition.</p><p><b>Musket, Axe:</b> This musket features an axe blade at the end of its barrel. It can be used as both a musket and a battleaxe. It is considered a double weapon for purposes of creating masterwork or magical versions of this weapon. If this firearm gains the broken condition, both the firearm component and the axe are considered broken. An axe musket uses either a bullet and a single dose of black powder or an alchemical cartridge as ammunition.</p><p><b>Musket, Double-Barreled:</b> This musket has two parallel barrels; each barrel can be shot independently as a separate action, or both can be fired at once as the same attack. If both barrels are fired at once, they must both target the same creature or object, and the gun becomes wildly inaccurate, taking a -4 penalty on each shot. Each barrel of a double-barreled musket uses either a bullet and a single dose of black powder or an alchemical cartridge as ammunition.</p><p><b>Musket, Warhammer:</b> This musket has a warhammer head at the end of its barrel, which allows it to be used as both a musket and a warhammer. It is considered a double weapon for purposes of creating masterwork or magical versions of this weapon. If this firearm gains the broken condition, both the firearm component and the warhammer are considered broken. A warhammer musket uses either a bullet and a single dose of black powder or an alchemical cartridge as ammunition.</p><p><b>Pepperbox:</b> This pistol has six barrels instead of one. The entire barrel housing can be quickly rotated by hand between shots (a free action requiring one free hand), allowing all six bullets to be fired before the weapon must be reloaded. Each barrel of a pepperbox uses either a bullet and a single dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition.</p><p><b>Pistol:</b> The single-shot pistol is one of the most common firearms, although in most campaigns it is still rare enough to be an object of envy or curiosity to most. A pistol uses either a bullet and a singe dose of black powder or an alchemical cartridge as ammunition.</p><p><b>Pistol, Coat:</b> Less powerful than other firearms, this pistol is small enough to be easily concealed in a jacket or coat. You get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal a coat pistol on your body. A coat pistol uses either a bullet and a single dose of black powder or an alchemical cartridge as ammunition.</p><p><b>Pistol, Dagger:</b> A combination of a coat pistol and a blade, the dagger pistol can be used as both weapons. The awkwardness of the configuration means you do not gain the bonus on Sleight of Hand checks that either of those stand-alone weapons grants. The dagger pistol is considered a double weapon for the purpose of creating masterwork or magical versions of this weapon. If this firearm gains the broken condition, both the firearm component and the dagger component are considered broken. A dagger pistol uses either a bullet and a single dose of black powder or an alchemical cartridge as ammunition.</p><p><b>Pistol, Double-Barreled:</b> This pistol has two parallel barrels; each barrel can be fired independently as a separate action, or both can be shot at once with the same action. If both barrels are shot at once, they must both target the same creature or object, and the pistol becomes wildly inaccurate, imparting a -4 penalty on each shot.</p><p><b>Pistol, Dragon:</b> Like a miniature blunderbuss, the dragon pistol fires pellets or a bullet from its flared barrel. The dragon pistol fires in a 15-foot cone when firing pellets, and has a 10-foot range increment when firing a bullet. For ammunition, a dragon pistol uses a bullet or group of pellets and a single dose of black powder, or else a single alchemical cartridge (with either bullets or pellets) as ammunition.</p><p><b>Pistol, Sword Cane:</b> A combination weapon, this gun mixes a coat pistol with a sword cane (Advanced Player's Guide 179). The sword cane pistol is considered a double weapon for the purpose of creating masterwork or magical versions of this weapon. The pistol attachment makes the nature of the weapon a little more difficult to hide. An observer must make a DC 15 Perception check to realize that an undrawn sword cane pistol is a weapon rather than a walking stick; the DC decreases to 5 if the observer is able to handle the weapon. A sword cane pistol uses either a bullet and a single dose of black powder or an alchemical cartridge as ammunition. The sword part of the weapon must be drawn in order to load the pistol part of the weapon.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"7IK034Ia1MAdHxrD"}

It is further modified by the base attack bonus of the attacking creature, how many critical feats the attacking creature has (if any; 10 maximum), and a bonus relationship between the size of the attacking creature and the target of the critical hit, if the attacking creature is larger than the creature it attacked.</p><p><b>Critical defense DC = critical hit roll + 1/2 attacker's base attack bonus + 1 for each critical feat + 1 for each size category larger attacker is than target</b></p><p>For instance, if a Medium creature is hit with a crossbow fired by a Medium 6th-level fighter with two critical feats, and the critical threat attack roll is a 19, the target of the potential critical hit makes a critical defense check with a DC of 24 to reduce the critical hit to a normal hit. If the target is wearing +1 leather armor, has a Dexterity of 18, and is using a +1 buckler, that target would have a +9 bonus on the critical defense check to reduce the critical hit to a normal hit. On a roll of 15 or higher, the critical hit is reduced to a normal hit, and the target takes normal damage for the hit (which is reduced by its DR). If the creature firing the crossbow had rolled a 20, the target of the critical hit would need to roll a 16 or higher on its critical defense check to reduce the impact of the critical hit, making it a normal hit.</p><p>On a failed critical defense check, the target of the critical hit takes the damage for the critical hit. That damage is still reduced by the target of the critical hit's DR.</p><p><b>Fortification Special Armor Quality:</b> The fortification special armor quality acts in concert with the check, coming into play if the armor check fails.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"7jhqMtAMq1lUSav6"}

While the name derives from ubiquitous stone tools such as flint spear points and basalt grinding stones, items crafted of clay, animal hides, wood, antlers, and other natural materials abound. Metals are limited to small silver, gold, copper, and tin deposits, as well as fabulously rare meteoric iron, all worked through beating and shaping. Metal items in a Stone Age campaign are as prized as magic items in a standard campaign.</p><p>Within the broad ranges of the Stone Age, considerable degrees of technological sophistication exist. At the low end, some areas might barely scrape together hide clothing, flint knives, and cooking fires, while at the higher end, more sophisticated craftsmanship like wooden armor, fired pottery, and quarried stone makes an appearance. Once the smelting of ore into metal appears, however, the culture moves into the Bronze Age or beyond.</p><p>Stone Age cultures tend to exist in a pre-currency condition, relying on barter, communalism, or the taking resources by force. However, Stone Age cultures that exist long enough often develop currencies based on materials other than metal coins, including cowries (smalls shells), carved stone money, and wooden tokens. Nearly all of these currencies represent some other item of value (such as grain or cattle), rather than having intrinsic value.</p><p>For the sake of simplicity, when creating a currency for your Stone Age campaign, create a baseline currency and have that currency represent 1 gp. Then create two forms of lesser currency to act as silver pieces and copper pieces. For example, a single cowrie shell could represent 1 gp, a quartz stone could represent 1 silver piece, and a stone arrowhead or simple stone tool could represent 1 copper piece.</p><p><b>Stone Age Weapons and Armor:</b> Stone Age campaigns feature standard weapons and armor made of bone, obsidian, and stone. Leather, hide, padded, and wooden armor (see pages 179-180 of the Advanced Player's Guide) and wooden shields are also available.</p><p>The following weapons are also available in Stone Age campaigns.</p><p><b>Atlatl:</b> An atlatl is a thin piece of wood or antler used as a lever to hurl a specially fitted dart. An atlatl gives much greater range to a dart, but must be loaded like a projectile weapon. Your Strength modifier applies to damage rolls when you use an atlatl, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire-but not load-an atlatl with one hand. Loading an atlatl is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity. The Rapid Reload feat can be taken for atlatls, allowing you to load a dart as a free action. Atlatl darts are the size of javelins but have fletching, and can be used as javelins without an atlatl.</p><p><b>Mere Club:</b> Traditionally made of sturdy carved stone, a mere (MEH-reh) is a short, flat-sided, sharp-pointed club.</p><p><b>Taiaha:</b> A taiaha is a long, heavy stick, club-shaped at one end and tipped with a wooden or metal spear point at the other. You wield it with a combination of solid strikes with the club and fending motions with the spear. A taiaha can be wielded as a martial weapon that deals 1d8/×2 bludgeoning damage.</p><p><b>Tepoztopilli:</b> The head of this wooden polearm is edged with jagged bits obsidian, glass, teeth, or similar materials. The wide head serves well for both piercing and slashing attacks.</p><p><b>Terbutje:</b> This length of tempered wood, also called a macuahuitl, has bits of shark teeth, obsidian, glass, or similar materials studded all along its length.</p><p><b>Terbutje, great:</b> This 4-foot-long version of the terbutje is too large to use in one hand without special training; thus it is an exotic weapon. A character can use a great terbutje two-handed as a martial weapon.</p><p><b>Wahaika:</b> This short and broad club is made of hardened wood or bone. It has a notch on one side that is used for catching weapons. If you are proficient, you use the notch in the wahaika to disarm your foes. Otherwise, treat this weapon as a club. Feats and abilities that affect clubs apply to the wahaika.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"87snPZRJoLna2m3n"}

This ability replaces divine grace.</p><p><b>Celestial Heart (Su):</b> As an empyreal knight advances, her ties with the celestial realms grant her a portion of the abilities and defenses of true angels. At 3rd level, she gains resistance 5 against acid, cold, and electricity. At 6th level, she gains a +4 racial bonus on saves against poison. At 9th level, her defenses improve to resistance 10 against acid, cold, and electricity. At 12th level, she gains immunity to petrification.</p><p>At 15th level, she gains truespeech, the ability to speak with any creature that has a language as though using a tongues spell. This ability functions with a caster level equal to her character level, and is always active.</p><p>At 18th level, as a swift action, the empyreal knight can manifest a protective aura against evil. Against abilities or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of her. It otherwise functions as a magic circle against evil. She can use this ability for a maximum of 1 round per day per paladin level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. These abilities replace mercy.</p><p><b>Celestial Ally (Sp):</b> At 4th level, an empyreal knight can summon a celestial ally as a full-round action. This functions as summon monster I, except it can only be used to summon celestial creatures, archons, and angels. At 6th level, this improves to summon monster II, increasing by one spell level for every two levels thereafter, to a maximum of summon monster IX at 20th level. This ability can be used a number of times per day equal to the empyreal knight's Charisma modifier (minimum 1), but only one ally can be summoned at a time. This ability replaces lay on hands and channel positive energy.</p><p><b>Divine Bond (Su):</b> At 5th level, an empyreal knight forms a bond with a mount, as the standard paladin ability. Her mount gains the celestial template at 8th level. At 12th level, her mount sprouts wings if it cannot already fly, and gains a fly speed of twice its land speed and good maneuverability. If the mount could already fly, its fly speed and maneuverability improve to at least this level. This ability otherwise functions as the paladin ability of the same name.</p><p><b>Empyreal Champion:</b> At 20th level, an empyreal knight transcends her mortal self. Her DR increases to 10/evil. Her type is treated as outsider for the purposes of spells and magical effects. She gains darkvision 60 feet and low-light vision. As a standard action and a supernatural ability, she can sprout wings that allow her to fly at twice her land speed with average maneuverability. Any armor or clothing reshapes to allow her to fly when she uses this ability. She can retract the wings as a free action. Unlike other outsiders, an empyreal knight can still be brought back from the dead as if she were a member of her previous creature type. This ability replaces holy champion.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"9OLxpWcA7MRpaq0w"}

Presented below is a brief overview of each chapter and a taste of the new material you can expect therein. Additionally, the table of contents on the previous page and the index located at the back of this book should assist you in locating specific topics quickly and easily.</p><h1>CHAPTER 1: CLASSES</h1><p>This chapter is a treasure trove of new information for martially oriented characters of all different types and personalities. First up is not one, but three new classes, all extensively playtested by the gaming community at paizo.com: the gunslinger, the samurai, and the ninja. The gunslinger is a skirmisher who's mastered the strange and mysterious art of black powder to become a blazing champion on the battlefield, dropping foes left and right with well-placed bullets or the sweeping spreads of scatter weapons. Intended to help players and GMs simulate everything from old-west icons to the classic musketeers of medieval history, the gunslinger uses a new \"grit\" mechanic to help her make all sorts of astounding maneuvers and astonishing trick shots in the heat of battle. The gunslinger is a complete, standalone base class that takes characters from 1st level through 20th.</p><p>Next up are two new alternate classes, the samurai and the ninja. Alternate classes are similar to base classes, save that they \"replace\" a preexisting base class for a given character (for more information on different class types, see page 8). The samurai is an alternate version of the cavalier, a master of armored combat who operates with impeccable honor and discipline. Inspired by both history and mythology, a samurai is a fearless paragon of war and greatly respected by the people he protects, dedicating himself to the way of the sword, bow, and horse. The ninja, by contrast, is a classic creature of darkness, slinking stealthily through the shadows and combining mystical abilities with martial arts techniques and specialized weapons to serve as an assassin and infiltrator without compare.</p><p>This chapter also presents a wide array of new rules for many different classes, designed to help them distinguish themselves even more in the frantic press of combat. Most of these rules take the form of archetypes-sets of alternate class abilities organized around particular themes. Archetypes replace existing class features and help players customize and optimize characters toward certain character concepts, such as the barroom brawler or the magical siege mage. Also included are more rogue tricks, barbarian rage powers, alchemist discoveries, and a host of other new tricks and techniques for new or preexisting characters.</p><h1>CHAPTER 2: FEATS</h1><p>This chapter presents a ton of new combat-oriented feats, most of which can be taken by any character. Included as well are such specialized feat types as teamwork feats that help allies work together to cut through their foes' battle lines with ease, style feats that represent specific martial arts approaches, and grit feats that allow gunslingers to perform seemingly impossible deeds with their firearms. This section offers a wealth of opportunity for character customization. Risk your own flesh for an advantage with Death or Glory, keep the pain coming with Impaling Critical, go totally berserk with Raging Brutality, and more!</p><h1>CHAPTER 3: MASTERING COMBAT</h1><p>This chapter focuses on providing GMs and players with exciting new subsystems to help expand the existing combat rules of the game, adding additional customizability and fleshing out fun and interesting corner cases in the rules. First comes Eastern armor and weapons, ranging from the stylized lamellar and terrifying kabuto helmets of the traditionalist samurai to Asian-inspired weapons familiar to most players-such as the legendary katana and wakizashi-plus fun and unique weapons pulled from all corners of Japan, China, India, and beyond. Dazzle your enemies with the bizarre urumi whip-sword, the horned shield known as the madu, or the oddly named yet deadly serious double chicken saber!</p><p>This section is followed by extensive rules for firearms, both primitive muzzle-loaders and more advanced weapons utilizing cartridges. Though devoted gunslingers are best suited to the use of firearms, characters of any class might be seduced by the power and roar of these captivating weapons. From there, the discussion turns to gladiator weapons, unusual items most often used on the bloodied sands of great arenas.</p><p>The primitive armor and weapons section covers specific battle gear from the stone and bronze ages, which experienced adventurers know can prove surprisingly effective in the hands of skilled combatants. In addition, this section presents rules for crafting weapons and armor of gold, obsidian, bone, and other such substances, introducing the new fragile weapon quality. This is followed by a section on duels, which dovetails with the spell dueling rules in Ultimate Magic to create a formalized system of honorable combat, including specialized dueling actions such as the dueling parry. Following this is the new performance combat subsystem, an all-new rules set to cover those fights where what matters most is not triumph or failure, but playing to the crowd and winning over onlookers with fantastic moves and a flair for the dramatic.</p><p>Last but not least come new rules for siege engines of both mechanical and alchemical nature, from familiar and deadly catapults to wall-shattering cannons, plus siege towers, scaling ladders, and everything else PCs might need to assault a fortress and capture it-or smash it to the ground.</p><h1>CHAPTER 4: VEHICLES</h1><p>These new rules provide an in-depth system for vehicles, from sailing ships to carriages, magical conveyances to dirigibles. Though GMs are still welcome to treat vehicles as simple props and scenery around which combat takes place, the challenge of driving (or boarding or disabling) vehicles adds a new zest to such classic encounters as stagecoach robberies and high-seas ship-to-ship combat.</p><h1>CHAPTER 5: VARIANT RULES</h1><p>This section caters to those players and GMs who like to tinker, presenting several wholly optional rules sets that replace existing systems to radically change the way combat works in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. From armor as damage reduction and a new way to track wounds and vigor to called shots and piecemeal armor, this section ensures that you'll never look at combat the same way again.</p><h1>CHAPTER 6: SPELLS</h1><p>This final chapter contains nearly 30 pages of new combat-oriented spells, including spells for every spellcasting class in the game.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"AObWjtFBSkHbT5dq"}

The earliest authors of fantasy and weird fiction often included guns in their stories. Heroes like Burroughs's John Carter or Howard's Solomon Kane carried pistols alongside their swords, and it's hard to imagine a pirate ship without cannons blazing. These authors likely included guns because they are exciting, but also because the guns they chose were primitive ones-relatively unpredictable weapons, prone to misfire and malfunction. This made firearms excellent storytelling devices. Such weapons could cause hero or villain to falter or triumph, changing the action within the tale in a flash or a fizzle. Still, a firearm remains an ominous and terrible weapon in the hands of a skilled gunman.</p><p>This section presents an anachronistic collection of hand-held black powder weapons. Most of them are single-shot muzzle-loaders with highly inefficient triggering mechanisms-traditional sword and sorcery firearms. More advanced firearms are also presented for those brave enough to mix their fantasy with a technology much closer to that of the Old West than the slow and unstable weapons that gave musketeers their name. If you are interested in letting such weapons in your game, do so with the following warning: Advanced guns can substantially change the assumptions of your game world, in the same way that they changed the face of warfare in the real world. If you like your fantasy to be of the more traditional variety, stand clear. Or, better yet, run for cover.</p></text>\n            <img src=\"worlds/Fresh/Pathfinder%20Ultimate%20Combat/images/Collage%20Firearms.jpg\"/>","_id":"AiGVJGwgMA3n6qTn"}

Siege engines hurl massive projectiles in one of two ways: direct fire or indirect fire. Both take a number of actions to load or aim, and the basic rules are described below.</p><p><b>Load Ammunition:</b> In order for a ranged siege engine to fire, it needs to be loaded with ammunition. Loading ammunition takes a number of full-round actions depending on the siege engine (this time can be reduced to move actions if the crew leader has the Master Siege Engineer feat; see page 109).</p><p><b>Aiming a Siege Engine:</b> Ranged siege engines must be aimed in order to attack a desired target (in the case of direct-fire siege engines) or square (in the case of indirect-fire siege engines). Aiming takes a number of full-round actions (or move actions if the crew leader has the Master Siege Engineer feat presented on page 109), with the number depending on the specific siege engine. Aiming a siege engine with a diminished crew doubles the amount of time it takes to aim the siege engine. Each time a new target or square is chosen as the target of a siege engine's attack, that engine must be aimed anew.</p><p><b>Direct-Fire Ranged Siege Engines:</b> Direct-fire weapons launch their projectiles on a relatively flat trajectory, allowing them to more easily target creatures or pummel barriers directly in front of them.</p><p>A direct-fire weapon uses a normal attack roll, with the normal penalty for nonproficient use. In addition, a direct-fire weapon takes a -2 attack roll penalty per size category that the weapon is larger than the creature aiming it. Creatures that have ranks in Knowledge (engineering) or use a targeting platform (see below) are not adversely affected by their size when firing direct-fire ranged siege engines.</p><p>Sheer manpower can also reduce the penalties for size. Increasing the crew of these weapons by 1 or more can reduce the attack roll penalty for creature size: as long as an extra crew member is no smaller than three size categories smaller than the direct-fire weapon, it can reduce the penalty due to the aiming creature's size by 2. For example, a Huge ballista fired by a Medium creature that is part of a crew of two (the creature aiming the ballista and someone to help position it) takes only a -2 penalty on attack rolls.</p><p><b>Indirect-Fire Ranged Siege Engines:</b> Indirect-fire weapons launch projectiles in high arcs toward their targets. They typically lob heavier missiles and payloads than direct-fire weapons, but they are harder to aim accurately. Indirect weapons can bypass many forms of fortification, delivering their payloads of solid shot, scatter shot, or even disease-ridden offal to targets beyond the walls of castles. They can also be used to batter fortifications where they are most vulnerable, arcing down on towers and walls, crushing them with the weight of stone or raining down smaller projectiles on a wall's defenders.</p><p>Indirect-fire weapons use a targeting mechanic similar to that described for catapults in the Core Rulebook, hereafter referred to as an indirect attack. The following is an update to those rules.</p><p><i>Indirect Attack:</i> To fire an indirect-fire ranged siege engine, the crew leader makes a targeting check against the DC of the siege engine. This check uses his base attack bonus, his Intelligence modifier (if not trained in Knowledge [engineering]) or Knowledge (engineering) skill modifier (if trained in that skill), any penalty for not being proficient in the siege engine, and the appropriate modifiers from Table 3-12. If the check succeeds, the ammunition of the indirect attack hits the square the siege engine was aimed at, dealing the indicated damage or effect to any object or creature within the area of its attack. Creatures may get a saving throw to limit the effect of the attack; this is typically based on the type of ammunition used.</p><p>If the attack misses the intended square, roll 1d8 to determine in what direction the shot veers. A roll of 1 indicates the ammunition falls short (toward the siege engine), with rolls of 2 through 8 counting squares clockwise around the target square. Roll 1d4 for every range increment at which the attack was made (1d4 if the target square is within the engine's first range increment, 2d4 if the target square is within the second range increment, and so on). The total is the number of squares by which the attack misses, with the direction in which the squares are counted determined by the d8 roll. The ammunition deals its damage and any other effects in the square it lands on.</p><h1>TABLE 3-12: INDIRECT ATTACK CHECK MODIFIERS</h1><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td colspan=\"2\"><b>Condition</b></td><td><b>Modifier</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">No line of sight to target square</td><td>-6</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Successive shots (crew can see where most recent miss landed)</td><td>Cumulative +2 per previous miss (maximum +10)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Successive shots (crew can't see where most recent missed shot landed, but observer is providing feedback)</td><td>Cumulative +1 per previous miss (maximum +5)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Successive shots after a hit</td><td>+10</td></tr></table></text>\n            ","_id":"Bxyi37NaJzt49q3I"}

At higher levels, magical travel becomes a common occurrence, as does travel by horseback, atop animal companions, or via more exotic mounts. Every so often, travel may involve a vehicle of some sort-the wagons of a caravan, a wind-tossed galley, some fantastic form of aerial transport, or even a planes-hopping device. If you like your games with a dose of weird, such vehicles may be as strange as a crashed space vessel. Whatever the case, vehicles in the Pathfinder RPG are often treated as either mobile terrain or adventure sites in their own right.</p><p>Many of the iconic motifs that inspire roleplaying games touch on vehicular adventures, from the voyages of Jason and the Argonauts to pirate tales, from charioteers in blood-soaked arenas under a drone of cheers to those who would chase and tame dragons. History and fiction are full of interesting vehicles performing death-defying actions. The rules in this chapter allow you to run combats with vehicles in the Pathfinder RPG, rather than just treating them as objects or terrain.</p><p>The following rules attempt to strike a balance between verisimilitude and ease and speed of play during combat. In areas where those two balancing points are conflicted, ease of use should always prevail.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"CkYuhg0lQeklIWw9"}

If this simple system involves too much abstraction, you can have vehicles make wide turns.</p><p>Have the driver make a driving check as usual. If she succeeds at the check, she can turn the vehicle. When a vehicle makes a turn, it has a chance to make a vehicular overrun or ramming maneuver on any creature within the turning area, which is a square with sides equal to the vehicle's length, with one vertex touching the front facing of the vehicle on the side opposite to the direction of the turn. In other words, put the square with one side running along the vehicle's front, perpendicular to its forward facing, and another running the direction of its current forward facing. Place the square so its far corner is within the desired destination of the vehicle. If the turn is successful, the vehicle ends this movement in that area, facing toward the direction of the turn.</p><p>The vehicle then makes either vehicular overruns or vehicular bull rushes (if the driver makes the required swift action) on all creatures and objects within the square that are smaller than it, and makes ramming maneuvers on all creatures and objects that are larger than it, including solid objects. It takes a -10 penalty on the vehicular bull rush and vehicular overrun maneuvers. The driver can choose to make these in any order she likes. She makes them one at a time (even after the vehicle is wrecked or comes to a sudden stop), and all effects are cumulative. If the vehicle is wrecked or comes to a sudden stop, the GM decides the final resting location within the turning area, picking the most plausible location given the effects.</p><p>For instance, if the square has two objects larger than the vehicle and three creatures smaller than it, and the driver decides to make the ramming maneuver on the objects first, and then is wrecked during the ramming maneuver on the second object, the vehicle still makes the vehicular overruns on the other two creatures. It ends in a location of the GM's choosing.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"D0muJ2wev68FfZqz"}

A cord attached to both arms is winched back and a projectile is loaded into a grooved slider for release. Ballistae are direct-fire weapons.</p><p><i>Light:</i> This common type of ballista, also called an arbalest or scorpion, is size Large, maneuverable, and often mounted atop towers or even vehicles. Light ballistae have a hardness of 5 and 50 hit points. Light ballista bolts cost 10 gp each and weigh 10 pounds.</p><p><i>Heavy:</i> These Huge-sized siege engines are commonly used as castle defenses, as well as on large warships. Heavy ballistae have a hardness of 5 and 100 hit points. Heavy ballista bolts cost 30 gp and weigh 20 pounds each.</p><p><i>Gate Breaker:</i> This massive ballista fires specially weighted quarrels with blunt mental tips. These are used as long-range battering rams, shot at walls or the gates of castles. When they hit a wooden structure, they have a critical range of 19-20/×3. Gate breaker ballistae have a hardness of 5 and 200 hit points. Gate breaker ballista bolts cost 50 gp and weigh 30 pounds each.</p><p><b>Bombard:</b> Resembling either large cauldrons or more traditional cannons, these firearms lob their ammunition in an arc in order to deliver their deadly payloads over troops or castle walls. Bombards are normally fired indirectly, but can also be fired as direct-fire siege engines. When they are used for direct fire, they take a -4 penalty on attack rolls and have their range increment halved, but do not have a minimum range. Like all firearms, bombards do not suffer mishaps, but instead have a misfire chance.</p><p><i>Light:</i> These bombards resemble cauldrons attached to swivels. Often they are mounted into the ground or into the stone of castle walls because of the mighty power of their recoil. The targeting DC of a light bombard is 15. A light bombard has a base misfire range of 1-2 (10 feet). Light bombards have a hardness of 10 and 70 hit points. Light bombard balls cost 30 gp each and weigh 25 pounds.</p><p><i>Standard:</i> These bombards feature the greatest diversity of forms. Many take the cauldron shape of the light bombard, but they may also take the forms of more traditional cannons, albeit featuring stabilizing mechanisms that allow them to fire at a much steeper incline. The targeting DC of a standard bombard is 20. A standard bombard has a misfire range of 1-2 (20 feet). Standard bombards have a hardness of 10 and 140 hit points. Standard bombard balls cost 35 gp each and weigh 30 pounds.</p><p><i>Heavy:</i> These massive siege engines are often fixed to positions on high hilltops or atop massive keeps, raining death down on a valley or strait. Often these firearms come in two pieces connected by a screw mechanism. The bombard is unscrewed to be loaded, and then the main part of the muzzle is screwed back on to the barrel section in order to be fired. Heavy bombards are too large and powerful to mount on vehicles. The targeting DC of a heavy bombard is 25. A heavy bombard has a misfire range of 1-2 (30 feet). Heavy bombards have a hardness of 10 and 280 hit points. Heavy bombard balls cost 45 gp each and weigh 50 pounds.</p><p><b>Cannon:</b> Cannons are crafted of metal-some are cast in one piece, others welded with iron bands-and mounted either in the ground or on wooden frames. Cannons use black powder to propel their projectiles with great force. A cannon has a misfire range of 1 (20 feet). Cannons have a hardness of 10 and 70 hit points. Cannon balls cost 30 gp each and weigh 25 pounds.</p><p><b>Catapult:</b> Catapults are stone-throwing siege engines powered by winched arms that run through torsion skeins, and hold their payload in a cup that swings up and over the weapon when released. Catapults can hurl a variety of different types of ammunition (the damage given is for stone projectiles; other types of ammunition can be found later in this chapter). They are indirect-fire siege engines.</p><p><i>Light:</i> These catapults are Large and often mounted on wheels. The targeting DC of a light catapult is 15. Light catapults have a hardness of 5 and 50 hit points. Light catapult stones cost 10 gp and weigh 50 pounds each.</p><p><i>Standard:</i> These Huge siege engines are too large to be transported to the battlefield in one piece, and require assembly. They typically hurl large stones indirectly at a target (targeting DC 20). Standard catapults have a hardness of 5 and 100 hit points. Standard catapult stones cost 15 gp and weigh 75 pounds each.</p><p><i>Heavy:</i> These Gargantuan siege engines are too large to be transported to the battlefield in one piece, and require assembly. They typically hurl large stones indirectly at a target (targeting DC 25). Heavy catapults have a hardness of 5 and 200 hit points. Heavy catapult stones cost 25 gp and weigh 90 pounds each.</p><p><b>Fiend's Mouth Cannon:</b> These massive cannons are usually crafted in multiple pieces, and sometimes feature the heads of demons, devils, or other fiends at their mouths. Like normal canons, they propel their projectiles with great force. A fiend's mouth cannon has a misfire range of 1 (30 ft.). Fiend's mouth canons have a hardness of 10 and 140 hit points. Fiend's mouth cannon balls cost 45 gp and weigh 30 pounds each.</p><p><b>Firedrake:</b> These large siege engines are typically wheeled or attached to vehicles that can transport them to the battlefield. This apparatus fires gouts of alchemist's fire in either a 60-foot line or a 30-foot cone (siege crew leader's choice). Targets in the area take 6d6 points of fire damage (DC 15 Reflex save halves); those who fail their saves also catch on fire. A firedrake with the broken condition that suffers a further mishap explodes, dealing its damage to all creatures within a 20-foot blast (DC 15 Reflex save halves). Firedrakes have a hardness of 10 and 70 hit points. One use of firedrake ammunition costs 200 gp and weighs 20 pounds.</p><p><b>Firewyrm:</b> This siege engine is a larger version of the firedrake. A firewyrm is too large to be transported to the battlefield in one piece and must be assembled once the component parts reach the battlefield. A firewyrm fires its gout of flame in either a 120-foot line or a 60-foot cone (crew leader's choice). Targets in the area take 6d6 points of fire damage (DC 20 Reflex save halves). A firewyrm with the broken condition that suffers a further mishap explodes, dealing its damage to all creatures within a 30-foot blast (DC 20 Reflex save halves). Firewyrms have a hardness of 10 and 140 hit points. One use of firewyrm ammunition costs 400 gp and weighs 40 pounds.</p><p><b>Springal:</b> A springal uses a torsion-cranked composite paddle to strike a firing rack containing multiple arrows or black-powder-propelled rockets, which rain down in an arc over a burst area. Springals are indirect-fire weapons that affect an area centered on the target square.</p><p><i>Arrow:</i> This springal propels a group of arrows that rains down on the targeted square and in a 15-foot burst around that square. One use of arrow springal ammunition costs 20 gp and weighs 10 pounds.</p><p><i>Rocket:</i> This highly volatile springal propels a group of black-powder rockets that rain down on the targeted square and in a 15-foot burst around the area. If the rocket springal misfires, it explodes, dealing its damage in a 20-foot blast around the springal. This explosion destroys the rocket springal. One use of rocket springal ammunition costs 500 gp and weighs 30 pounds.</p><p><b>Trebuchet:</b> Trebuchets are similar in form to catapults, with the payload placed into a basket, cup, or sling at the end of a long lever, and a counterweight (often with crew or animals pulling attached ropes) close to the fulcrum. The leverage imparted by a trebuchet allows it to hurl massive missiles that scatter to a number of squares around the target square based on the size of the trebuchet. Trebuchets are too bulky to move on wheels or vehicles and must be assembled on the battlefield. Trebuchets have a minimum range of 150 feet.</p><p><i>Light:</i> These Large siege engines typically hurl large stones indirectly at a target (targeting DC 15). A light trebuchet's ammunition scatters on contact, dealing full damage to the target square and half its damage to creatures and objects within 5 feet of the target square (creatures can make a DC 15 Reflex save to halve the damage again). Light trebuchets have a hardness of 5 and 50 hit points. One use of light trebuchet stones costs 15 gp and weighs 60 pounds.</p><p><i>Standard:</i> These Huge siege engines typically hurl large stones indirectly at a target (targeting DC 20). A standard trebuchet's ammunition scatters on contact, dealing full damage to the target square and half damage to creatures and objects within 15 feet of the target square (creatures can make a DC 20 Reflex save to halve the damage again). Standard trebuchets have a hardness of 5 and 100 hit points. One use of standard trebuchet stones costs 30 gp and weighs 110 pounds.</p><p><i>Heavy:</i> These Gargantuan siege engines typically hurl large stones indirectly at a target (targeting DC 25). A heavy trebuchet's ammunition scatters on contact, dealing full damage to the target square and half its damage to creatures and objects within 30 feet of the target square (creatures can make a DC 25 Reflex save to halve the damage again). Heavy trebuchets have a hardness of 5 and 200 hit points. One use of heavy trebuchet stones costs 30 gp and weighs 120 pounds.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"DSiC8spBYVWdQu2I"}

They gain power from their truly primitive nature; their bodies and spirits are hardened by the wild and untainted existence far from the pathetic softness of so-called civilization. Even when forced to mingle with civilization, the true primitive stays apart in both traditions and trappings.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> A true primitive is proficient with hide armor and armors made from bone (see page 146). A true primitive is also proficient with bone shields and the following weapons: battleaxe, blowgun, club, greatclub, handaxe, longspear, shortspear, sling, and spear.</p><p><b>Illiteracy:</b> A true primitive cannot read or write, and her superstition about such things leads her to refuse to ever learn to read or write, even if she multiclasses into other classes.</p><p><b>Favored Terrain (Ex):</b> A true primitive has a favored terrain representing her native homeland. This ability functions as the ranger class feature, and the true primitive's bonuses in that terrain improve by +2 at 5th level and every five levels thereafter. However, she does not gain any additional favored terrains. This ability replaces fast movement.</p><p><b>Trophy Fetish (Ex):</b> A true primitive collects teeth, bones, hair, and other trophies from vanquished enemies, representing their power and strength. At 3rd level, a true primitive can attach a trophy fetish to one of the traditional true primitive weapons listed above. When wielding that weapon, the true primitive gains a +1 morale bonus on damage rolls. Furthermore, if that weapon has the fragile property, once per day, the true primitive can ignore the effects of a single natural 1 roll. A trophy fetish can also be attached to a suit of hide armor, granting the true primitive a +1 morale bonus on saving throws. Furthermore, if that armor has the fragile property, once per day, the true primitive can chose not to have the armor break on the confirmation of a critical hit made against her. Every five levels beyond 3rd, a true primitive can use an additional trophy fetish. Multiple trophy fetishes can be attached to the same armor or weapon; their effects stack. A trophy fetish can be sundered (hardness 5, 1 hit point) but is not damaged by area attacks or attacks that do not specifically target it. It has no effect if attached to other types of weapons or armor. This ability replaces trap sense.</p><p><b>Rage Powers:</b> The following rage powers complement the true primitive archetype: animal fury, eater of magic*, ghost hunter*, greater primal scent*, low-light vision, night vision, primal scent*, scent, spell sunder*, sunder enchantment*, superstition, and witch hunter**.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"DhDf7HPzYhLtWljP"}

Some are also devoted to the destruction of proscribed knowledge and are equally zealous in the pursuit of its destruction. Most of these cavaliers believe that the preservation of a written work is more important than a single life, even their own, as it ensures future generations benefit from its wisdom.</p><p><b>Challenge:</b> Whenever an order of the tome cavalier issues a challenge, he receives a +2 bonus on all saving throws against spells or spell-like abilities cast by the subject of his challenge and a +2 bonus on all Bluff and Sense motive checks involving the subject of his challenge.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> An order of the tome cavalier adds Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), and Linguistics to his list of class skills. Furthermore, he can use Linguistics untrained. If he has ranks in Linguistics, he receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1).</p><p><b>Order Abilities:</b> A cavalier belonging to the order of the tome gains the following abilities as he increases in level.</p><p><i>Specialized Knowledge (Ex):</i> At 2nd level, an order of the tome cavalier chooses either Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge (religion). He can make the chosen skill checks untrained. He cannot change his chosen skill later. If he has ranks in his chosen skill, he receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1) as long as that check involves a book, tome, scroll, or any other form of written knowledge.</p><p><i>Powerful Knowledge (Ex):</i> At 8th level, the cavalier gains the ability to read scrolls and cast arcane or divine spells from a scroll as if he had a caster level of his cavalier level -4. He can decipher all scrolls, using his Linguistics skill in place of Spellcraft, and does not need to cast read magic in order to decipher a scroll. Which type of spell the cavalier can cast is based on the Knowledge skill he chose for specialized knowledge. If he chose Knowledge (arcana), he can cast any arcane spells from a scroll. If he chose Knowledge (religion), he can cast any divine spells from a scroll. Furthermore, he gains a +1 bonus to an ability score for purposes of determining the level of spells he can cast from a scroll, and this bonus increases by +1 at 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter (to a maximum of +4 at 20th level). The ability score that gains the bonus is dependent on which skill the cavalier picked for his specialized knowledge ability. If the cavalier picked Knowledge (arcana), he gains the bonus to Intelligence. If he picked Knowledge (religion), he gains the bonus to Wisdom.</p><p><i>Defensive Knowledge (Ex):</i> At 15th level, an order of the tome cavalier can grant nearby allies some of the boons of his cavalier challenge. While allies are adjacent to the cavalier, they gain a +2 bonus on all saving throws against spells or spell-like abilities cast by the subject of the cavalier's challenge. In addition, as an immediate action, a number of times per day equal to the cavalier's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) or Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), the cavalier can allow an ally adjacent to him to reroll a single failed saving throw against a spell or spell-like ability from the target of his challenge. The ally must be able to see and hear the cavalier in order to gain this reroll. The ability score that determines how many times per day a cavalier can use this ability depends on which Knowledge skill the cavalier picked for specialized knowledge. If the cavalier picked Knowledge (arcana), the number of times per day this ability can be used is based on Intelligence. If he picked Knowledge (religion) it is based on Wisdom.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"EGiNvivf9RgGG0P1"}

Combining this emerging technology with their considerable arcane skills, they transform firearms into a powerful focus.</p><p><b>Arcane Gun (Su):</b> The spellslinger gains the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearms) feat, and one or two of his firearms can be arcane guns. Arcane guns are normal one-handed or two-handed firearms in the hands of others, as they were normal firearms before the spellslinger imbued them with magic. In a spellslinger's hands, they both fire projectiles (bullets and pellets) and cast magic. At 1st level, the spellslinger decides whether he wants to have one or two arcane guns at a time. If the spellslinger chooses to have only one arcane gun at a time, spells fired through the arcane gun that require an attack roll have a ×3 critical hit multiplier.</p><p>A spellslinger can cast any ranged touch attack, cone, line, or ray spells through his arcane gun. When he casts through the arcane gun, the gun's enhancement bonus (if any) is a bonus to the spell's attack rolls or to the spell's saving throw DCs. Yet there are dangers inherent to this method. If any of the spells' attack rolls result in a natural 1 (a misfire), or a natural 20 is rolled on any saving throw made against the spell by a target (an overload), the arcane gun gains the broken condition. If the arcane gun already has the broken condition, the gun explodes. When a gun explodes, it lets loose a blast of force, or if the spell has the acid, cold, electricity, or sonic descriptor, it deals that type of energy damage instead. In the case of spells with multiple descriptors, roll randomly among the descriptors to determine the type of damage dealt by the blast. The blast is centered on a single intersection within the spellslinger's space (spellslinger's choice) and deals 1d6 points of the appropriate energy damage or force damage per level of the spell cast. Any creature within the blast other than the spellslinger can make a Reflex saving throw to halve the damage. The Reflex save DC is calculated using the spell level of the spell being sacrificed.</p><p>A spellslinger can attune his arcane guns at the start of each day. That attunement lasts until the spellslinger attunes to a new gun, even if a formally attuned gun is destroyed. This ability replaces arcane bond.</p><p><b>Gunsmith:</b> The spellslinger gains the Gunsmithing feat (see page 103) and a battered gun that is identical to the gun a gunslinger (see page 9) gains at first level. If the spellslinger chooses the ability to attune two arcane guns, he still only starts out with one gun. Like a gunslinger, a spellslinger can use the Gunsmithing feat to restore his battered gun. This ability replaces scribe scroll.</p><p><b>Mage Bullets (Su):</b> A spellslinger is adept at transferring spell energy into his arcane gun attacks. As a swift action, he can sacrifice a spell and transform that energy into a weapon bonus equal to the level of the spell sacrificed on a single barrel of his firearm. With that weapon bonus the spellslinger can apply any of the following to his arcane bond: enhancement bonuses (up to +5) and dancing, defending, distance, flaming, flaming burst, frost, ghost touch, icy burst, merciful, seeking, shock, shocking burst, spell storing, thundering, vicious, and wounding. An arcane gun gains no benefit from having two of the same weapon special abilities on the same barrel. The effect of the mage bullets ability lasts for a number of minutes equal to the level of the spell sacrificed, or until this ability is used again to assign the barrel different enhancements. This ability replaces cantrips, but the spellslinger gains the detect magic and read magic cantrips and places them in his spellbook. He can cast either of these as 1st-level spells.</p><p><b>School of the Gun:</b> The rigor and care required by arcane guns is so great that a spellslinger forsakes four schools of magic. These opposition schools are chosen at 1st level and cannot be changed later. A spellslinger who prepares a spell from his opposition school must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell. In addition, the spellslinger takes a -4 penalty on any skill checks made when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of his opposition schools as a prerequisite. This ability replaces arcane school.</p></text>\n            <img src=\"worlds/Fresh/Pathfinder%20Ultimate%20Combat/images/Spellslinger.jpg\"/>","_id":"EP6Twyx0Rm2jZiJo"}

This ability replaces her Heavy Armor Proficiency.</p><p><b>Shared Precision (Su):</b> At 3rd level, when a divine hunter hits a creature with a ranged attack, she grants her allies within 10 feet of her the benefit of the Precise Shot feat against that target until the start of her next turn.

The lists presented here summarize all of the new spells presented in this book, except for spells that interact with the optional wounds and vitality subsystem presented in Chapter 5. The spells for this subsystem are presented in that chapter.</p><p>An [M] or [F] appearing at the end of a spell's name in the spell list denotes a material or focus component not normally included in a spell component pouch.</p><p><b>Order of Presentation:</b> The first spell lists presented are the lists of spells separated by class and level. These include the spell name and a brief and incomplete description of the spell. Immediately after those lists is a complete list of all spells with full descriptions of those spells listed. Spells in all lists are presented in alphabetical order, except when a spell's name begins with \"communal,\" \"greater,\" \"lesser,\" or \"mass,\" in which case it is alphabetized under the base spell name.</p><p><b>Hit Dice:</b> The term \"Hit Dice\" is used synonymously with \"character levels\" for effects that affect a specific number of Hit Dice of creatures.</p><p><b>Caster Level:</b> A spell's power often depends on caster level, which is defined as the caster's class level for the purposes of casting a particular spell. The word \"level\" in the short spell descriptions that follow always refers to caster level.</p><p><b>Creatures and Characters:</b> The words \"Creature\" and \"character\" are used synonymously in the short descriptions.</p><p><b>Communal Spells:</b> Communal spells function like other spells, except they allow you to divide the duration among multiple targets, treating each target as a subject of the spell. When you divide the duration, you must divide it as evenly as possible among the targets. Furthermore, unless the communal spell's description indicates otherwise, no target can receive a duration increment smaller than the smallest increment of duration listed in the spell description. For example, if you are 5th level, your communal spell's duration is 10 minutes per level, and you have four targets, each target must receive 10 minutes of duration. The extra 10 minute duration can go to one of the four targets or it is wasted.</p><p><i>A Note on Alchemists:</i> Dispensing communal formulae to creatures requires that the alchemist have the infusion discovery. Without it, the alchemist cannot use communal spells as formulae.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"FtINHX3dh5EiRQau"}

When a character selects a class, he must normally choose to use the standard class features found in the class's original source (typically the Core Rulebook or the Advanced Player's Guide)-the exception is if he chooses to adopt an archetype. Each alternate class feature presented in an archetype replaces a specific class feature from its parent class. For example, the flowing monk archetype's redirection class feature replaces the Stunning Fist feature of the standard monk class.</p><p>When an archetype includes multiple alternate class features, a character must take them all-often blocking the character from ever gaining certain standard class features, but replacing them with other options. All other class features of the base class that aren't mentioned among the alternate class features remain unchanged and are acquired normally when the character reaches the appropriate level, unless noted otherwise. A character who takes an alternate class feature does not count as having the class feature that was replaced for the purposes of meeting any requirements or prerequisites.</p><p>A character can take more than one archetype and garner additional alternate class features, but none of the alternate class features can replace or alter the same class feature from the base class as another alternate class feature. For example, a fighter could not be both an armor master and a brawler, since both archetypes replace the weapon training 1 class feature with something different.</p><p>If an archetype replaces a class feature that is part of a series of improvements or additions to a base ability (such as a fighter's weapon training or a ranger's favored enemy), the next time the character would gain that ability, it counts as the lower-level ability that was replaced by the archetype. In effect, all abilities in that series are delayed until the next time the class improves that ability. For example, if an archetype replaces a rogue's +2d6 sneak attack bonus at 3rd level, when she reaches 5th level and gains a sneak attack bonus, her sneak attack doesn't jump from +1d6 to +3d6-it improves to +2d6, just as if she had finally gained the increase at 3rd level. This adjustment continues for every level at which her sneak attack would improve, until at 19th level she has +9d6 instead of the +10d6 of a standard rogue.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"FzeegTx5y50YbKLe"}

The following are the major examples of performance combat, but you should feel free to mix and match some of these general categories to create a performance combat that fits the story of your campaign.</p><p><b>Knockout Bout:</b> Frequently as brutal but not as bloody as battles to the death, a knockout bout does not end in the death of one side, but still requires a clear and crushing victory. As long as both sides in the performance combat remain standing, the fight continues. Many knockout bout combats require that their participants deal nonlethal damage.</p><p><b>Staged Combats:</b> Staged combats are less dangerous than knockout bouts. In these contests, combatants typically arrange to have blows that just barely land, so the hits are not registered as either nonlethal or lethal damage, but crowd reaction is determined in the same way as for normal battles. Staged combats often require advanced training (see the Stage Combatant feat on page 121). Those without advanced training can attempt to participate, but take a -6 penalty on attack rolls in order to make it seem like their attacks hit without doing real damage.</p><p><b>To a Number of Wounds:</b> Not all blood sports end in death. It is often costly to train warriors for arenas big and small, and those who finance such enterprises are protective of their investments. In societies that value life but still love the spectacle of a good fracas, fighting to a number of wounds is an excellent compromise. A fight to first blood or to a certain number of wounds is often enough to appease a crowd.</p><p><b>To the Death:</b> Only the death of one side ends these bouts. Sometimes the crowd's reaction is secondary to the desperate battle on display, but other times the crowd's reaction can have an effect on the actual outcome of the fight. Some blood sports demand that combatants hold off on the killing blow until the crowd gets a chance to voice its pleasure or displeasure, usually with a roar of applause or with a thumbs-up or thumbs-down gesture. A thumbs-up gesture allows the vanquished combatant to live and fight another day; a thumbs-down gesture ends the melee with a grotesque spray of blood.</p><p><b>Toward a Goal:</b> Often these are elaborate affairs that may reproduce a historical battle, or just pit combatants against terrain and challenges that feature a variety of hazards and traps. These types of battles can be races (maybe mixing them with the rules for vehicular combat presented in Chapter 4), or may present capture-the-flag-like objectives, but all test the ability of the combatants to achieve a predetermined goal.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"HFo8MN5q8DXDoN53"}

Primitive equipment, on the other hand, is crafted from the best materials available, which are often inferior in performance. Sometimes these differences are hand-waved away (as in the case of most mundane gear and items listed on Table 6-9 in the Equipment chapter of the Core Rulebook), but in the case of weapons and armor, these differences are not as easily overlooked.</p><p>All of the special materials listed below have their own rules and exceptions that make them function slightly differently (typically worse) than the standard materials for weapons found in the Pathfinder RPG. Some of these materials grant the item the fragile quality-a quality that can be applied to both weapons and armor.</p><p><b>Fragile:</b> Fragile weapons and armor cannot take the beating that sturdier weapons can. A fragile weapon gains the broken condition if the wielder rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with the weapon. If a fragile weapon is already broken, the roll of a natural 1 destroys it instead.</p><p>Armor with the fragile quality falls apart when hit with heavy blows. If an attacker hits a creature wearing fragile armor with an attack roll of a natural 20 and confirms the critical hit (even if the creature is immune to critical hits), the armor gains the broken condition. If already broken, the armor is destroyed instead. Fragile armor is not broken or destroyed by critical threats that are not generated by natural 20s, so if a creature wielding a weapon with a 19-20 or 18-20 critical range scores a critical hit on the wearer of this armor with a roll of less than a natural 20, that critical hit has no chance to break or destroy the armor.</p><p>Masterwork and magical fragile weapons and armor lack these flaws unless otherwise noted in the item description or the special material description.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"HIK3omoGt1zf39hm"}

Exotic even within their own cultures, a number of these weapons require specialized training, and the secrets of their mastery are well protected in remote temples and secret dojos. In most Eastern cultures, the weapon is more than just a means of defense; possibly representing a cultural tradition or philosophy. It may display social status or even tell the history of a clan or house.</p><p>This section contains all the Eastern weapons needed to run an Eastern-inspired fantasy campaign with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. They were chosen from a variety of Asian cultures, including those of China, Japan, Korea, India, the Philippines, and more. In addition to the equipment presented here, both the Core Rulebook and the Advanced Player's Guide contain weapons and armor common to Asian-themed campaigns. Eastern weapons from the Core Rulebook include the kama, nunchaku, sai, siangham, shuriken, and the spiked chain, while most armor (with the exception of plate mail) is similarly common to both regions. Eastern weapons from the Advanced Player's Guide include the chakram and the temple sword.</p><p><b>Special:</b> Some of the following weapons have special qualities in addition to those noted in their description. Most weapon special quality descriptions can be found on pages 144-145 of the Core Rulebook. New weapon special qualities are described below.</p><p><i>Blocking:</i> When you use this weapon to fight defensively, you gain a +1 shield bonus to AC.</p><p><i>Deadly:</i> When this weapon delivers a coup de grace, it gains +4 to damage when calculating the DC of the Fortitude saving throw to see whether the target of the coup de grace dies from the attack. The bonus is not added to the actual damage of the coup de grace attack.</p><p><i>Distracting:</i> You gain a +2 bonus on Bluff skill checks to feint in combat while wielding this weapon.</p><p><i>Grapple:</i> On a successful critical hit with a weapon of this type, you can grapple the target of the attack. The wielder can then attempt a combat maneuver check to grapple his opponent as a free action. This grapple attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the creature you are attempting to grapple if that creature is not threatening you. While you grapple the target with a grappling weapon, you can only move or damage the creature on your turn.

Discoveries that modify bombs and are marked with a single asterisk (*) do not stack. Only one such discovery can be applied to an individual bomb.</p><p><b>Breath Weapon Bomb*:</b> Instead of drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb, the alchemist can draw the components, drink them, mix them within his body, and then expel them as a breath weapon as a standard action. This breath weapon is a 15-foot cone and has the same DC as the bomb. Each creature within the cone takes damage as if it had suffered a direct hit from the alchemist's bomb, but succeeding at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligent modifier) halves the damage. Unlike throwing normal bombs, drawing, drinking, and expelling breath weapon bombs does not provoke attacks of opportunity. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.</p><p><b>Explosive Missile:</b> As a standard action, the alchemist can infuse a single arrow, crossbow bolt, or one-handed firearm bullet with the power of his bomb, load the ammunition, and shoot the ranged weapon. He must be proficient with the weapon in order to accomplish this. When the infused ammunition hits its target, it deals damage normally and detonates as if the alchemist had thrown the bomb at the target. If the explosive missile misses, it does not detonate. An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.</p><p><b>Immolation Bomb*:</b> When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have its substance coat the direct target's body, causing the bomb to deal its damage over time instead of all at once. The bomb's effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the number of damage dice the bomb would normally deal (for instance, a 5d6 bomb lasts for 5 rounds). When the bomb hits the direct target, the bomb deals 1d6 + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier in damage, and those within the splash zone take damage equal to 1 + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. It repeats this damage against the direct target of the bomb each round the immolation bomb lasts, dealing the damage at the start of the alchemist's turn. Splash damage is dealt again to any creature that is adjacent to the direct target when it takes damage from the immolation bomb. A creature taking damage from an immolation bomb's direct hit can attempt to extinguish the flames as a full-round action that requires a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligent modifier). Because of the alchemical nature of this bomb, rolling on the ground does not grant a bonus on the saving throw, and dousing a creature with water does not stop it from burning. These bombs can be used underwater. An alchemist must be at least 3rd level before selecting this discovery.</p><p><b>Nauseating Flesh:</b> The alchemist's body is suffused with poison. Any creature that bites, engulfs, or swallows the alchemist must make a Fortitude saving throw or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. An alchemist must be at least 12th level before selecting this discovery. The alchemist with this discovery does not suffer the effect of the poison of his own nauseating flesh.</p><p><b>Poison Conversion:</b> By spending 1 minute, the alchemist can convert 1 dose of poison from its current type (contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury) to another type. For example, the alchemist can convert a dose of Small centipede poison (an injury poison) to an inhaled poison. This process requires an alchemy lab. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.</p><p><b>Siege Bomb*:</b> As a standard action, the alchemist infuses a single piece of ammunition on a loaded siege weapon with the power of his bomb. As long as the siege engine with this ammunition is fired before the start of the alchemist's next turn, the ammunition does damage normally, and also deals the damage of the alchemist's bomb. The splash radius of the bomb effect is 20 feet rather than 5 feet. Creatures that take the bomb's damage (either direct damage or splash damage), take 1d6 points of fire damage (or another energy type, if the alchemist is capable of modifying his bombs in that way) each round until the fire is extinguished. Extinguishing the flames is a full-round action that requires a Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target with a +2 bonus on the save. Dousing the target with at least 2 gallons of water automatically extinguishes the flames. An alchemist must be at least 12th level and must possess the explosive bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"JHmeJ3dSxgECD49C"}

There are many types of alchemical cartridges, the simplest being the paper cartridge-a simple mix of black powder and either pellets or a bullet. Alchemical cartridges make loading a firearm easier, reducing the time to load a firearm by one step (a full-round action becomes a standard action, a standard action becomes a move action, and a move action becomes a free action), but they tend to be unstable. The misfire value of a weapon firing an alchemical cartridge increases as listed in each entry.</p><p><b>Dragon's Breath Cartridge:</b> This cartridge contains alchemical compounds that, when fired, produce a cone of fire instead of the normal attack of a one-handed or two-handed firearm with the scatter weapon quality. The nonmagical flame deals 2d6 points of fire damage to all targets within the cone of the scatter firearm (DC 15 Reflex save for half). These cartridges cannot be used in firearms that don't have the scatter weapon quality. Because this ammunition forces a saving throw instead of making an attack roll, the misfire rules are slightly different. If you roll a 1 with either of the damage dice, the firearm misfires.</p><p><b>Entangling Shot Cartridge:</b> This mix of black powder and an alchemically treated resin strong enough to survive the shot can only be loaded into a blunderbuss, a dragon pistol, or other scatter weapon. It deals half damage to those hit by a cone attack made with this weapon, but any creature hit by the shot must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex saving throw or become entangled for 2d4 rounds. An entangling shot cartridge increases the firearm's misfire value by 2.</p><p><b>Flare Cartridge:</b> When a flare cartridge hits its target, it only deals half damage, but the creature struck is blinded for 1 round (Fort DC 15 reduces this to dazzled), and creatures within a 20-foot burst are dazzled for 1 round (Fort DC 15 negates the effect). Flare cartridges are also useful for sending up signal flares. Firing a flare cartridge increases the firearm's misfire value by 2 unless it is fired from a blunderbuss or a dragon pistol, in which case doing so only increases the firearm's misfire value by 1. Flares can only be used to attack single creatures; they do not work as a shot for a cone scatter attack.</p><p><b>Paper Cartridge:</b> This simple mix of black powder and either pellets or a bullet increases the misfire value by 1.</p><p><b>Salt Shot Cartridge:</b> This mix of black powder and rock salt can only be loaded into a blunderbuss, a dragon pistol, or other scatter weapon. It deals nonlethal instead of lethal damage, and increases the misfire value by 1. You can only use it with a scatter weapon's cone attack.</p><p><b>Black Powder:</b> Black powder is the key explosive component within a firearm that enables it to function, but in larger amounts this alchemical material can be quite destructive on its own as well. A single dose of black powder is enough to power a single shot from most one-handed and two-handed firearms, while 10 doses are required to fire a cannon. Black powder is often stored and transported in kegs (which hold 100 doses), but in this quantity the powder itself becomes dangerous. Exposure to fire, electricity, or a misfire explosion causes black powder to explode-a single keg that explodes in this manner deals 5d6 points of fire damage to anyone within a 20-foot burst (DC 15 Reflex half). Storing black powder in a powder horn protects the powder from explosion.</p><p><b>Bullet:</b> The ammunition of most one-handed and two-handed firearms, firearm bullets typically take the form of small balls of lead or some other metal.</p><p><b>Bullet, Adamantine:</b> These expensive bullets are crafted from adamantine. They ignore hardness 20 or less when attacking objects.</p><p><b>Bullet, Pitted:</b> This ammunition is pitted with a pattern of small pocks into which specially formulated poison compounds can be applied. A poison compound is a derivative of a standard toxin that is alchemically reduced to a solid form. These can be made from any standard injury or contact poison with a Craft (poison) check equal to the poison's DC + 4. The cost of purchasing an already prepared poison compound for the purpose of treating pitted bullets is equal to the poison's base cost + 20 gp. Once crafted, the compound can be pasted into the ammunition's pitted design and allowed to harden. Upon completion, the bullet can be fired from an appropriate firearm, releasing the poison compound into its target upon impact, but the poison's DC is reduced by 2. A pitted bullet cannot be used with an alchemical cartridge.</p><p><b>Bullet, Silver:</b> This ammunition is specifically crafted from silver, and though nonmagical, it is particularly detrimental to lycanthropes, automatically confirming any critical threats against such creatures. A firearm that is shooting a silver bullet takes a -1 penalty on damage rolls (with a minimum of 1 point of damage).</p><p><b>Gunsmith's Kit:</b> This small kit has all the tools a person needs to create, repair, and restore firearms, except for the necessary raw materials. Without such a kit, you cannot properly construct or provide upkeep for firearms.</p><p><b>Metal Cartridge:</b> These sturdier versions of alchemical cartridges serve as the ammunition for advanced firearms. They can hold either bullets or pellets.</p><p><b>Pellets:</b> A handful of pellets, along with a dose of black powder, is commonly used as ammunition for one-handed and two-handed firearms with the scatter weapon quality, though rocks or other small bits of hard material can be used in the pellets' place. Using anything other than pellets or alchemical cartridges when firing off a cone attack with a scatter weapon increases the weapon's misfire range by 1 (though this increase can be removed by switching back to standard ammunition).</p><p><b>Powder Horn:</b> Typically crafted from animal horn, but increasingly crafted from metal in a wide variety of shapes, a powder horn can hold up to 10 doses of black powder. A powder horn protects black powder stored within in it from exposure to fire, electricity, firearm misfires, and water.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"L5wLnRrSjZhep1Ic"}

Rather, hit points suggest that the fighter has undergone more training, and while he may have improved his ability to deal with wounds to a small degree, the hit points gained at higher levels reflect less his capacity for physical punishment and more his skill at avoiding hits, his ability to dodge and twist and turn. Each loss of hit points, in this case, suggests that he is becoming progressively less nimble over the course of combat-in other words, that the decreasing hit points are a marker for his overall endurance and condition. It's not quite as satisfying, however, to roll a critical hit and then tell a player that his opponent ducked out of the way, but that the sword's slash made the enemy a little less lucky.</p><p>This variant system for tracking wounds and vigor should help to remedy that.

Inescapable grasp is a swift action and lasts until the beginning of the wrestler's next turn. This ability replaces abundant step, improved evasion, timeless body, and tongue of sun and moon.</p><p><b>Form Lock (Su):</b> At 13th level, a tetori can negate a polymorph effect by touch with a Wisdom check, adding a bonus equal to his monk level, against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the effect (or HD of the creature, for supernatural polymorph effects).

Should a samurai's mount die, the samurai may find another mount to serve him after 1 week of mourning. The new mount does not gain the link, evasion, devotion, or improved evasion special abilities until the next time the samurai gains a level.</p><p><b>Order (Ex):</b> At 1st level, a samurai must pledge himself to a specific order, typically the order of the warrior. The order grants the samurai a number of bonuses, class skills, and special abilities. In addition, each order includes a number of edicts the samurai must follow. If he violates these edicts, he loses the benefits of his order's challenge ability for 24 hours. The violation of an edict is subject to GM interpretation.</p><p>Most samurai belong to the order of the warrior and are dedicated to their lord. Those without a lord, or who chose to abandon their lord, are ronin. A samurai may instead elect to dedicate himself to one of the orders listed under the cavalier description (see pages 34-37 of the Advanced Player's Guide), but such samurai are rare.</p><p>A samurai who wishes to change his order must undertake a lengthy process to dedicate himself to a new cause. When this choice is made, he immediately loses all of the benefits from his old order. He must then follow the edicts of his new order for one entire level without gaining any benefits from that order. Once he has accomplished this, he gains all the bonuses from his new order. The only exception to this is when a samurai decides to become a ronin. A samurai can elect to become a ronin immediately, losing all the benefits from his old order and replacing them with the new benefits from the ronin order. Once a ronin, however, the only way for the samurai to change to another order is through the method described above. Note that the names of these orders might vary depending upon the campaign setting or GM's preference.</p><p><b>Resolve (Ex):</b> Starting at 1st level, the samurai gains resolve that he can call upon to endure even the most devastating wounds and afflictions. He can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day for every two samurai levels beyond 1st. Whenever the samurai defeats the target of his challenge, he regains one daily use of his resolve, up to his maximum number of uses per day. Defeating the target of his challenge usually involves reducing the target to 0 hit points or fewer, but the GM might rule that an enemy who surrenders or flees the battle is also defeated. He can use this resolve in a number of ways.</p><p><i>Determined:</i> As a standard action, the samurai can spend one use of his resolve to remove the fatigued, shaken, or sickened condition. If the samurai is at least 8th level, he can alternatively remove the exhausted, frightened, nauseated, or staggered condition. If the condition has a duration longer than 1 hour or is permanent, this ability removes the condition for 1 hour, at which time the condition returns.</p><p><i>Resolute:</i> Whenever the samurai is required to make a Fortitude or Will save, he can spend one use of his resolve as an immediate action to roll twice and take the better result. He must decide to use this ability before he rolls the saving throw.</p><p><i>Unstoppable:</i> When the samurai is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points but not slain, he can spend one use of his resolve as an immediate action to instantly stabilize and remain conscious. He is staggered, but he does not fall unconscious and begin dying if he takes a standard action. He does fall unconscious if he takes additional damage from any source.</p><p><b>Weapon Expertise (Ex):</b> At 3rd level, a samurai gains an unparalleled expertise with his chosen weapons. At 3rd level, the samurai selects either the katana, longbow, naginata, or wakizashi. The samurai can draw the selected weapon as a free action as if he had the Quick Draw feat. In addition, whenever he threatens a critical hit with the selected weapon, he gains a +2 bonus on the confirmation roll. Finally, his samurai levels stack with any fighter levels he possesses for the purposes of meeting the prerequisites for feats that specifically select his chosen weapon, such as Weapon Specialization.</p><p><b>Mounted Archer (Ex):</b> At 4th level, the samurai becomes skilled at firing ranged weapons while mounted. A samurai only takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls with ranged weapons while his mount takes a double move. This penalty increases to -4 while his mount is running.</p><p><b>Banner (Ex):</b> At 5th level, a samurai's banner becomes a symbol of inspiration to his allies and companions. As long as the samurai's banner is clearly visible, all allies within 60 feet receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made as part of a charge. At 10th level, and every five levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by +1. The banner must be at least Small or larger and must be carried or displayed by the samurai or his mount to function.</p><p><b>Bonus Feat:</b> At 6th level, and every six levels thereafter, a samurai gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats. The samurai must meet the requirements of these bonus feats.</p><p><b>Greater Resolve (Ex):</b> At 9th level, a samurai can spend his resolve to negate some of his most grievous wounds. After a critical hit is confirmed against him, the samurai can spend one use of his resolve as an immediate action to treat that critical hit as a normal hit. Effects that only trigger on a critical hit do not trigger when the samurai uses this ability.</p><p><b>Honorable Stand (Ex):</b> At 11th level, a samurai can make an honorable stand, deciding to fight the target of his challenge to the bitter end, no matter the cost. He can make an honorable stand once per day at 11th level, plus one additional time per day at 16th level. Declaring an honorable stand is a swift action. While making an honorable stand, the samurai is immune to the shaken, frightened, and panicked conditions. He does not fall unconscious while his hit point total is below 0. Finally, whenever a samurai making an honorable stand must make a saving throw, he can spend one daily use of his resolve to reroll the saving throw after the first roll is made. He must take the result of the second roll, even if it is worse. If a samurai making an honorable stand ever retreats from battle against his challenged foe, he loses the ability to make a challenge for 24 hours.</p><p><b>Demanding Challenge (Ex):</b> At 12th level, whenever a samurai declares a challenge, his target must pay attention to the threat he poses. As long as the target is within the threatened area of the samurai, it takes a -2 penalty to its AC on attacks made by anyone other than the samurai.</p><p><b>Greater Banner (Ex):</b> At 14th level, a samurai's banner becomes a rallying call to his allies. All allies within 60 feet receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and compulsion spells and effects. In addition, while his banner is displayed, the samurai can spend a standard action to wave the banner through the air, granting all allies within 60 feet an additional saving throw against any one spell or effect that is targeting them. This save is made at the original DC. Spells and effects that do not allow saving throws are unaffected by this ability. An ally cannot benefit from this ability more than once per day.</p><p><b>True Resolve (Ex):</b> At 17th level, a samurai can spend uses of his resolve to avoid death. If he has at least two uses of his resolve remaining, he can spend all of the daily uses of his resolve that he has available to him to avoid death. Regardless of the source of the attack that would have killed him, he is left alive, at -1 hit points (or lower if he was already below -1), unconscious, and stable.</p><p><b>Last Stand (Ex):</b> At 20th level, a samurai can make a last stand once per day whenever he makes a challenge. While this challenge is in effect, all melee and ranged weapons deal the minimum amount of damage to the samurai, unless the attack scored is a critical hit. In addition, the samurai remains conscious and is not staggered while he is below 0 hit points. While using this ability, the samurai cannot be killed by melee or ranged weapons unless they are wielded by the target of his challenge. Attacks made by opponents that are not the target of his challenge deal no damage when samurai has 0 or fewer hit points. This ability has no effect on spells, environmental effects, supernatural abilities, or any other source of damage other than melee and ranged weapons. Such sources of damage affect him normally and can kill him (although they do not cause him to fall unconscious or to become staggered if they reduce his hit points below 0). This effect lasts until the challenge ends or the samurai takes an offensive action against a target other than the target of his challenge.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"Lsv3YvW2SC6hjn0n"}

The best of them are also skilled at determining the strengths and weaknesses of their enemies, as well as at countering some of those strengths with their own formidable abilities.</p><p><b>Tactician (Ex):</b> As the cavalier class feature, except that a strategist can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and for every four levels thereafter (to a maximum of five times per day at 17th level).</p><p><b>Drill Instructor (Ex):</b> At 4th level, a strategist learns to train his fellow adventurers in the nuances of squad combat. By spending 10 minutes and expending 1 use of his challenge ability, the strategist can grant the use of a teamwork feat that he knows to up to four of his allies, similar to the tactician ability. As with tactician, allies need not meet the prerequisites of the granted feat, but they retain the use of this feat for 10 minutes plus 1 minute for every two levels the cavalier possesses, as long as the cavalier is visible and can be heard by his allies. If the cavalier falls unconscious or cannot be both seen and heard, his allies lose the benefit of the granted feat until the condition is remedied. This ability replaces expert trainer.</p><p><b>Tactical Advantage (Ex):</b> At 14th level, whenever a strategist uses his tactician ability to grant the use of a teamwork feat to his allies, he can move up to his speed as a free action either before or after granting the feat. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity normally. This ability replaces greater banner.</p><p><b>Strategic Supremacy (Ex):</b> At 18th level, a strategist gains the ability not only to improve his allies' abilities, but also to disrupt the teamwork of his enemies. Whenever the strategist uses the tactician ability, he can choose to cancel out the effects of one teamwork feat employed by any of his opponents within 30 feet instead of granting the use of a teamwork feat to his allies.

He knows how the world flows, and forces his enemies to flow with it. Even the most powerful stone breaks under the graceful and persistent pressure of wind and water.</p><p><b>Bonus Feat:</b> A flowing monk replaces the normal monk bonus feats with the following: Agile Maneuvers, Combat Reflexes, Deflect Arrows, Dodge, Improved Reposition*, Improved Trip, Nimble Moves, and Weapon Finesse. At 6th level, the following feats are also available: Acrobatic Steps, Bodyguard*, Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Ki Throw*, Mobility, Second Chance*, and Sidestep*. At 10th level, the following feats are added: In Harm's Way*, Repositioning Strike*, Snatch Arrows, Spring Attack, and Tripping Strike*. (Asterisks denotes feats from the Advanced Player's Guide.)</p><p><b>Redirection (Ex):</b> At 1st level, as an immediate action, a flowing monk can attempt a reposition or trip combat maneuver against a creature that the flowing monk threatens and that attacks him. If the combat maneuver is successful, the attacker is sickened for 1 round (Reflex DC = 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + monk's Wisdom modifier to halve the duration), plus 1 additional round at 4th level and for every four levels afterward (to a maximum of 6 rounds at 20th level). The monk gains a +2 bonus on the reposition or trip combat maneuver check and the save DC for redirection increases by 2 if the attacker is using Power Attack or is charging when attacking him. The benefit increases to a +4 bonus and an increase of the saving throw by 4 if both apply.</p><p>At 4th level, a flowing monk can use redirection against an opponent that the flowing monk threatens and that attacks an ally with a melee attack. At 8th level, a flowing monk can make both a reposition and a trip maneuver as part of a single immediate action with this ability. At 12th level, a flowing monk can use redirection against any opponent that attacks him in melee, even if the flowing monk is not threatening the opponent who attacks him. A flowing monk can use this ability once per day per monk level, but no more than once per round. This ability replaces stunning fist.</p><p><b>Unbalancing Counter (Ex):</b> At 2nd level, a flowing monk's attacks of opportunity render a struck creature flat-footed until the end of the flowing monk's next turn (Reflex DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + Wisdom modifier negates). This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 2nd level.</p><p><b>Flowing Dodge (Ex):</b> At 3rd level, a flowing monk gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC for each enemy adjacent to him, up to a maximum bonus equal to his Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This ability replaces fast movement.</p><p><b>Elusive Target (Ex):</b> At 5th level, as an immediate action, a flowing monk may spend 2 points from his ki pool to attempt a Reflex save opposed by an attacker's attack roll to halve damage from that attack. At 11th level and above, the flowing monk suffers no damage on a successful save, or half damage on a failed save. If the attacker is flanking the monk, the flanking opponent who is not attacking becomes the target of the attack. Use the same attack roll, and if the attack hits the new target, that creatures takes half damage (or full damage if the attack is completely avoided). Any associated effects from the attack (such as bleed, poison, or spell effects) apply fully even if the attack deals only half damage. This ability replaces purity of body and diamond body.</p><p><b>Volley Spell (Su):</b> At 15th level, when a targeted spell or spell-like ability fails to overcome a flowing monk's spell resistance, he may reflect the effect onto its caster as spell turning (Core Rulebook 347) by spending a number of points from his ki pool equal to 1/2 the spell's level (minimum 1).

Some close assault weapons are not even weapons at all, but instead provide means for assault forces to protect themselves or circumvent fortifications without destroying them.</p><p><b>Bridge, Assault:</b> An assault bridge is used to span a ditch, moat, or other gap. Raising an assault bridge requires one full-round action per 5 feet of length; up to four creatures may cooperate to raise a bridge. The time required is doubled for each size category that the bridge is larger than the creatures raising it. Large assault bridges have 40 hit points, Huge ones have 60 hit points, Gargantuan ones have 160 hit points, and Colossal ones have 240 hit points.</p><h1>TABLE 3-16: BRIDGES AND ESCALADE LADDERS</h1><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Size</b></td><td><b>Width</b></td><td><b>Length/Height</b></td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>5 ft.</td><td>20 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>5 ft.</td><td>30 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>10 ft.</td><td>40 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>10 ft.</td><td>60 ft.</td></tr></table><p><b>Corvus:</b> A corvus is a boarding device that features a hinged counterweight system for mounting a bridge vertically on a siege tower or a vehicle, with a hooked end to grab onto a target vehicle or structure. A corvus is usually 10 feet wide and 15 feet long. It has a hardness of 5 and 10 hit points per square. Using a corvus requires a DC 10 Profession (siege engineer) check as a full-round action; if the check fails, the corvus fails to catch on the target and must be reset (a full-round action). A corvus mounted on a vehicle can target another moving vehicle (see Chapter 4: Vehicles). Doing so requires an opposed driving check to get the corvus into the correct position, which is within the length of the corvus and adjacent to the other vehicle. Once a corvus is attached, it takes a Strength check as a full-round action to dislodge the corvus. Alternatively, if the corvus is attached to a vehicle, either vehicle driver can make a driving check as a standard action to dislodge the corvus (a check that succeeds by 5 or more destroys the corvus). The base DC for either of these checks is 15, and the DC increases by 5 for every Small or Medium creature currently standing on the corvus. If a corvus is disengaged while creatures are standing on it, those creatures must make a DC 15 Reflex saving throw or fall. Succeeding at the saving throw allows them to move to the nearest area of safe ground, but such movement provokes attacks of opportunity. A corvus cannot be armored.</p><p><b>Gallery:</b> A mobile temporary defense, a gallery is similar to a building made of hide or wood. Most are of flimsy construction, but rare examples are more stoutly built (use the rules for giving siege engines armor, and adjust AC, hardness, and hit points accordingly). Galleries are almost always a single section of movable \"wall\" plus another section that acts as the \"roof.\" (Galleries made to house battering rams are an exception, and typically have two joined wall sections and roof sections.) Because a gallery is partially open, it does not provide the same cover as a normal building: a creature inside a gallery gains cover if it is the same size as the gallery, improved cover if it is one size smaller, and total cover if it is two or more sizes smaller. Galleries are sized like creatures-a Larger gallery protects the same space as a Large creature, and so on.</p><p>Wooden galleries can be moved on rollers at a speed of 10 feet with their full crew, or 5 feet with at least half the required crew. Galleries have a base speed of 15 feet (or 10 feet if protected with medium or heavy armor).</p><p>Galleries have a hardness of 5, and hit points based on their size. A Large gallery has 30 hit points, a Huge one has 120 hit points, a Gargantuan one has 320 hit points, and a colossal one has 625 hit points.</p><p><b>Ladder, Escalade:</b> Escalade ladders have spiked bases for stability, and the upper 5 feet are metal-shod, with hardness 10 and 20 hit points. The remainder of the ladder is wooden and has hardness 5 and hit points based on its size. Large escalade ladders have 20 hit points, Huge ones have 30 hit points, Gargantuan ones have 80 hit points, and Colossal ones have 120 hit points. Escalade ladders cannot be armored.</p><p><b>Rams:</b> The most basic close assault weapons are iron-shod logs carried by one or more creatures to combine their strength. A ram can be used to deal damage or to make a Strength check against the target's break DC.</p><p><i>Ramming Charge:</i> Rams require momentum to be effective. All creatures using the ram must use the charge action to gain its full effect. Creatures not wishing to charge may make a ram attack as a full-round action, taking a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls and Strength checks with the ram.</p><p><i>Breaking:</i> The crew leader makes a Strength check with a +2 bonus, adding +2 for each member of the crew (or equivalent number of larger creatures; see page 158) assisting. The ram also provides a +4 bonus per size category above Medium.</p><p><i>Damage:</i> The crew leader makes an attack roll with a -4 nonproficiency penalty. A hit deals the listed damage, plus the Strength modifiers of the crew leader and all members of the crew, regardless of their size.</p><p><i>Improvised Ram:</i> Any tree, log, or timber can be used as a ram with a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls and Strength checks.</p><p><i>Pick:</i> A ram with a pick head grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks and attack and damage rolls made against stone structures.</p><p><i>Screw:</i> A ram with a screw head grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks and attack and damage rolls made against earthen structures.</p><p><i>Gallery Ram:</i> This is a ram suspended from chains or ropes within a gallery. A gallery ram does not require a charge action for full momentum. In addition, adding tethers to the back end of the ram allows four additional crew members to assist in using the ram.</p><p><i>Hit Points:</i> Rams have a hardness of 5 and hit points based on their size. A Large ram has 30 hit points, a Huge one has 120 hit points, a Gargantuan one has 320 hit points, and a Colossal one has 625 hit points. Improvised rams have half the normal hit points.</p><p><b>Siege Tower:</b> A wooden gallery of stout construction, a siege tower consists of a tall protective shell with a roof section. The lower story of the tower contains the crew members who propel the tower, and provides total cover to those within. A siege tower with the broken condition moves at half speed. If a siege tower is destroyed, the entire tower collapses. Treat this as a cave-in (Core Rulebook 415).</p><p>The upper section of a siege tower provides improved cover for a number of soldiers (see below) and may have pierced walls allowing creatures to fire ranged weapons out the sides. The roof section may have a battlement and may mount a siege engine of the siege tower's size or smaller and a corvus. Siege towers have a base speed of 15 (or 10 feet if protected with medium or heavy armor).</p><p>Siege towers have a hardness of 5, and hit points based on their size. A Large siege tower has 60 hit points, a Huge one has 240 hit points, a Gargantuan one has 640 hit points, and a Colossal one has 1,250 hit points.</p><h1>TABLE 3-17: SIEGE TOWER COMPLEMENT</h1><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Size</b></td><td><b>Soldiers</b></td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>200</td></tr></table></text>\n            ","_id":"NRQQYHDmbraLm9ru"}

Known as ronin, these samurai wander the lands, serving their own code of ideals. While ronin are significantly freer to do as they please, they do not receive the same respect and support that a more dedicated samurai can count on. Note that cavaliers can select this order, but they are typically called knights errant instead of ronin.</p><p><b>Becoming Ronin:</b> Normally, when a samurai wishes to change his order, he must undergo a lengthy process that requires him to adhere to the edicts of his new order for a period of time before receiving any benefits. This is not the case with ronin. Once a samurai decides to become a ronin, he immediately loses all of the bonuses, skills, and abilities of his old order and gains those of the ronin order. If he wishes to once again dedicate himself to another order, he must do so using the normal rules.</p><p><b>Edicts:</b> Ronin follow their own personal code of ethics and honor. As such, their edicts are extremely flexible and subject to change. Each ronin should determine his own edicts, which should include at least three provisions. These edicts are subject to GM approval.</p><p><b>Challenge:</b> Whenever a ronin is the target of a challenge, a smite, a quarry, or similar effect, and he issues a challenge against that character in return, the ronin receives a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made against the target of his challenge and a +1 dodge bonus to his AC against attacks made by the target of his challenge. These bonuses increase by +1 for every four class levels the samurai possesses (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p><p><b>Skills:</b> A ronin adds Knowledge (local) (Int) and Survival (Wis) to his list of class skills.</p><p><b>Order Abilities:</b> A ronin samurai gains the following abilities as he increases in level.</p><p><i>Self Reliant (Ex):</i> At 2nd level, the ronin learns to rely solely on himself, even in the most difficult of times. Whenever the ronin fails a Will saving throw against an effect with a duration greater than 1 round, he can attempt another saving throw at the end of the second round of the effect. If he makes this saving throw, it has the same effect as if he had made the original save (negating part or all of the effect). In addition, whenever a ronin is brought below 0 hit points, on his next turn he can roll twice to stabilize, taking the better result.</p><p><i>Without Master (Ex):</i> At 8th level, the ronin's fierce independence allows him to overcome staggering odds. The ronin can summon up this willpower as an immediate action, and can use it in one of three ways. He can use his willpower whenever an attack would reduce him to fewer than 0 hit points but wouldn't kill him, to instead be at 1 hit point and conscious. He can use his willpower after making an attack roll to confirm a critical hit in order to reroll the confirmation roll. Finally, he can use his willpower to take 10 on a skill check during combat, even if the situation or the skill would not normally allow him to take 10. A ronin can use this ability once during a combat.</p><p><i>Chosen Destiny (Ex):</i> At 15th level, the ronin is the master of his own destiny. Whenever the ronin makes a saving throw against a charm or compulsion effect, he may roll twice and take the better result. In addition, once per day, the ronin can treat any one d20 roll as if the result were a natural 20. He must declare the use of this ability before the roll is made.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"O7lG519DbzuRevRU"}

Musketeers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with firearms. A cavalier's levels stack with any fighter levels he possesses for the purpose of meeting the level prerequisite for feats that specifically select a firearm, such as Weapon Specialization.</p><p><b>Gifted Firearm (Ex):</b> At 1st level, a musketeer is gifted by his order with a firearm (either a pistol or a musket). This weapon is both a symbol of the cavalier's duty and a focus for much of his talent. He cannot sell this weapon. He also gains the Gunsmithing feat.</p><p>Beginning at 8th level, the musketeer can focus himself when wielding his gifted weapon. As a standard action, he can focus himself to gain a number of benefits for 1 minute per cavalier level. The musketeer can use this ability twice per day, plus one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 8th, to a total of five times per day at 20th level.</p><p>At 8th level, the cavalier gains the benefit of the Improved Critical feat. At 11th level, he can reduce the misfire chance of his weapon by 1 (to a minimum of 1, as with the reliable firearm special ability), and at 17th level, the musketeer can double the range increment of his weapon (as the distance special ability). These abilities do not stack with the magical weapon special abilities that they duplicate.</p><p>Finally, at 20th level, during a period of such focus, the musketeer can engage in a flurry of gunfire. The cavalier can expend one of his daily challenges to make a full attack with his firearm. The musketeer ignores the normal load times for his weapon, but must still expend enough doses of powder and enough bullets to complete each attack.</p><p>If the musketeer's gifted firearm is destroyed, the cavalier loses this ability for 30 days while a replacement weapon is crafted for him. During this 30-day period, the musketeer takes a -1 penalty on weapon and damage rolls. This ability replaces the standard cavalier's mount ability.</p><p><b>Swift Powder (Ex):</b> At 4th level, the musketeer gains Rapid Reload (musket) or Rapid Reload (pistol) as a bonus feat. At 14th level, each time the musketeer issues a challenge, he may reload a wielded firearm as a free action. This ability replaces expert trainer.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"O9GesHDJl9SKY4GV"}

This archetype also fits roguelike characters that focus more on learning than on stabbing foes in the back.</p><p><b>Bardic Performance:</b> Archaeologists do not gain the bardic performance ability or any of its performance types.</p><p><b>Archaeologist's Luck (Ex):</b> Fortune favors the archaeologist. As a swift action, an archaeologist can call on fortune's favor, giving him a +1 luck bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Charisma modifier.

Archaeologist's luck is treated as bardic performance for the purposes of feats, abilities, effects, and the like that affect bardic performance.

At 10th level, he can reload, aim, and fire the siege engine purely by the power of this link, and no longer needs a crew to control the siege engine. It still takes the normal required amount of time and actions to control a siege engine in this manner. This ability replaces arcane bond. The siege mage can end this bond with a free action. A siege mage can bond with a siege engine in this manner a number of times per day equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) but can only be bonded with one siege engine at a time.</p><p><b>Empower Siege Engine (Su):</b> As a swift action, a siege mage can sacrifice one of his spells to empower the next attack he makes before the end of his turn with a siege engine he is bonded with. When he does, the siege engine attack gains a bonus on its attack roll or targeting roll equal to the level of the spell he sacrificed, and a bonus to damage equal to 3 × the level of the spell.

At 1st level, the siege mage forsakes three schools of magic. Once chosen, these opposition schools cannot be changed. A siege mage who prepares spells from his opposition school must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell. In addition, the siege mage takes a -4 penalty on any skill checks made when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of his opposition schools.

A dueling counter is similar to a counterspell, but is easier to use.</p><p>When a dueling opponent tries to cast a spell, the targeted spellcaster can make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + the spell's level) as a free action. If the check succeeds, she can identify her opponent's spell and can attempt a dueling counter. If it fails, she cannot attempt a dueling counter against that spell (although special actions are still available to her).</p><p>A dueling counter is an immediate action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. To attempt a dueling counter, the countering duelist must expend a spell or spell slot of a level equal to or higher than that of the spell being cast. Note that characters who cast spells spontaneously (such as bards, oracles, and sorcerers) must choose which exact spell they are using to counterspell in addition to the slot being used. The countering duelist must then make a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the spell's caster level. Unlike when using a true counterspell action (which requires a readied action), even expending an exact copy of the spell being cast does not guarantee success. The caster attempting the counterspell receives a bonus or penalty on her check depending upon the level of the spell slot being expended and the exact spell used, as noted in Table 3-10. If the check is successful, the spell is countered-it is negated and the spell is lost. If not, the spell takes effect as normal and the duelist attempting to counter the spell takes a -2 penalty on any saving throws made against the spell's effect.</p><p>Alternatively, a spellcaster can use dispel magic or greater dispel magic as a dueling counter. When a duelist spellcaster does so, he does not need to identify the spell being cast, can counter a spell of any level, and must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 11 + the spell's caster level. When dispel magic is used as a dueling counter, it is not modified by any of the circumstances in Table 3-10.</p><p>Because readying a counterspell is its own action, a dueling spellcaster can prepare to counterspell and make a dueling counter in the same round. This is only useful if the participant is facing multiple opponents, or someone with access to the Quicken Spell feat or other abilities that allow casting two spells in the same round.</p><h1>TABLE 3-10: DUELING COUNTER MODIFIERS</h1><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td colspan=\"3\"><b>Circumstance</b></td><td><b>Check Modifier</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Spell is of a different school</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Spell is of the same school, but not the same spell</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Spell is of a higher level than the spell being countered</td><td>+1/level above</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Spell is the same as the spell being countered</td><td>+10</td></tr></table></text>\n            ","_id":"PhRYMUFJ5BnpwzMd"}

A nonproficient character takes the standard -4 penalty on attack rolls with firearms, and a nonproficient character who loads a firearm increases all misfire values by 4 for the shots he loads.</p><p>Even though the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearms) feat grants you proficiency with all firearms, anytime you take a feat that modifies a single type of weapon (such as Weapon Focus or Rapid Reload), you must still pick one specific type of firearm (such as musket, axe musket, blunderbuss, pistol, or double pistol) for that feat to affect.</p><p>All firearms are part of the same weapon group for the purposes of the fighter's weapon training class feature.</p><p><b>Capacity:</b> A firearm's capacity is the number of shots it can hold at one time. When making a full-attack action, you may fire a firearm as many times in a round as you have attacks, up to this limit, unless you can reload the weapon as a swift or free action while making a full-attack action. In the case of early firearms, capacity often indicates the number of barrels a firearm has. In the case of advanced firearms, it typically indicates the number of chambers the weapon has.</p><p><b>Range and Penetration:</b> Armor, whether manufactured or natural, provides little protection against the force of a bullet at short range.</p><p><i>Early Firearms:</i> When firing an early firearm, the attack resolves against the target's touch AC when the target is within the first range increment of the weapon, but this type of attack is not considered a touch attack for the purposes of feats and abilities such as Deadly Aim. At higher range increments, the attack resolves normally, including taking the normal cumulative -2 penalty for each full range increment. Unlike other projectile weapons, early firearms have a maximum range of five range increments.</p><p><i>Advanced Firearms:</i> Advanced firearms resolve their attacks against touch AC when the target is within the first five range increments, but this type of attack is not considered a touch attack for the purposes of feats such as Deadly Aim. At higher range increments, the attack resolves normally, including taking the normal cumulative -2 penalty for each full-range increment. Advanced firearms have a maximum range of 10 range increments.</p><p><b>Loading a Firearm:</b> You need at least one hand free to load one-handed and two-handed firearms. In the case of two-handed firearms, you hold the weapon in one hand and load it with the other-you only need to hold it in two hands to aim and shoot the firearm. Loading siege firearms requires both hands, and one hand usually manipulates a large ramrod (which can be wielded as a club in combat).</p><p>The Rapid Reload feat reduces the time required to load one-handed and two-handed firearms, but this feat does not reduce the time it takes to load siege firearms.</p><p>Loading any firearm provokes attacks of opportunity.</p><p>Other rules for loading a firearm depend on whether the firearm is an early firearm or an advanced firearm.</p><p><i>Early Firearms:</i> Early firearms are muzzle-loaded, requiring bullets or pellets and black powder to be rammed down the muzzle. If an early firearm has multiple barrels, each barrel must be loaded separately. It is a standard action to load each barrel of a one-handed early firearm and a full-round action to load each barrel of a two-handed early firearm. It takes three full-round actions by one person to load a siege firearm. This can be reduced to two full-round actions if more than one person is loading the cannon.</p><p><i>Advanced Firearms:</i> Advanced firearms are chamber-loaded. It is a move action to load a one-handed or two-handed advanced firearm to its full capacity.</p><p><b>Misfires:</b> If the natural result of your attack roll falls within a firearm's misfire value, that shot misses, even if you would have otherwise hit the target. When a firearm misfires, it gains the broken condition. While it has the broken condition, it suffers the normal disadvantages that broken weapons do, and its misfire value increases by 4 unless the wielder has gun training in the particular type of firearm (see the gunslinger class on page 9). In that case, the misfire value increases by 2 instead of 4.</p><p><i>Early Firearms:</i> If an early firearm with the broken condition misfires again, it explodes. When a nonmagical firearm explodes, the weapon is destroyed. Magical firearms are wrecked, which means they can't fire until they are fully restored (which requires either the make whole spell or the Gunsmithing feat). When a gun explodes, pick one corner of your square-the explosion creates a burst from that point of origin. Each firearm has a burst size noted in parentheses after its misfire value. Any creature within this burst (including the firearm's wielder) takes damage as if it had been hit by the weapon-a DC 12 Reflex save halves this damage.</p><p><i>Advanced Firearms:</i> Advanced firearms can misfire, but when they do, they only gain the broken condition. A further misfire does not cause advanced firearms to explode.</p><p><b>Ammunition:</b> Firearm ammunition takes two forms: either black powder and shot (either bullets or pellets) or cartridges. Unlike other types of ammunition, firearm ammunition is destroyed when it is used, and has no chance of being retrieved on a miss. No part of a cartridge can be reused to create new cartridges. Firearm ammunition cannot be treated with poison, unless you are using a pitted bullet (see page 141).</p><p><b>Concealing Firearms:</b> Like light weapons and hand crossbows, one-handed firearms are easy to conceal on your person. Some smaller firearms (like the coat pistol) can grant bonuses to conceal a weapon on your person.</p><p><b>Inappropriately Sized Firearms:</b> You cannot make optimum use of a firearm that is not properly sized for you. A cumulative -2 penalty applies on attack rolls for each size category of difference between your size and the size of the firearm. If you are not proficient with the firearm, a -4 nonproficiency penalty also applies. The size of a firearm never affects how many hands you need to use to shoot it, the exception being siege firearms and Large or larger creatures. In most cases, a Large or larger creature can use a siege firearm as a two-handed firearm, but the creature takes a -4 penalty for using it this way because of its awkwardness.</p><p><b>Bucklers:</b> You can use a one-handed or two-handed firearm without penalty while carrying a buckler.</p><p><b>Fire while Prone:</b> Firearms, like crossbows, can be fired while their wielders are prone.</p><p><b>Firearms, Black Powder, and Water:</b> Black powder becomes useless when exposed to water, but powder horns and cartridges protect black powder from exposure. You cannot normally load an early firearm underwater or fire any firearm underwater without magical aid.</p><p><b>Deflecting and Snatching Bullets:</b> The Deflect Arrows feat (Core Rulebook 121) and the Snatch Arrows feat (Core Rulebook 134) can be used to deflect bullets, but not pellets shot from a scatter weapon. Neither of these feats can be used to deflect siege firearm attacks.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"QC3EKNNRMohTZZE7"}

They give an overview of the rules that all vehicles use.</p><list><li><b>Drivers:</b> Drivers control vehicles. A driver is a creature with an Intelligence score of at least 3 who is physically able to manipulate a vehicle's driving device and who is both within the driving spaces of a vehicle and actively manipulating the driving device.</li><li><b>Occupants:</b> Any creature riding, driving, serving as crew on, or providing propulsion for a vehicle is considered its occupant.</li><li><b>Facing:</b> Unlike characters, vehicles have a forward facing. A vehicle moves best when it moves in the direction of its forward facing.</li><li><b>Acceleration/Deceleration:</b> Vehicles must accelerate to reach their maximum speed. Each round, with the proper driving action and a successful check, the driver can increase the vehicle's movement by its rate of acceleration, as long that value is no greater than the vehicle's maximum speed. Vehicles must decelerate to slow down and are hard to stop at an exact point.</li><li><b>Initiative:</b> A vehicle moves at the start of its driver's turn. If a vehicle has no driver, it moves on the turn of the last creature that was its driver, or on a turn determined by the GM.</li><li><b>Controlling a Vehicle:</b> If a vehicle has a driver, before the driver does anything else on her turn, she must determine what drive action she is taking, and take that action. If the driver takes no action, takes some other action instead of driving the vehicle, or delays or readies an action-or if there is no driver-the vehicle takes the \"uncontrolled\" action. A driver can only take one action each turn to control a vehicle. Once the driver has selected the action, or takes some other action forcing the vehicle to become uncontrolled, the vehicle moves.</li><li><b>Driving Check:</b> When a driver takes a driving action, she must make a driving check to determine the maneuverability and speed of the vehicle that round. The vehicle's propulsion determines what skill is used for the driving check. A driver can always make a Wisdom check in place of a driving check. The base DCs for all driving checks are DC 5 and DC 20. Use the lower DC when the driver is not in combat and the higher DC when the driver is in combat.</li><li><b>In Combat:</b> Vehicles, creatures used as propulsion, and crew members do not threaten any area around them, but their drivers and their non-crew occupants do. Vehicles can enter the spaces of objects and creatures smaller than themselves. Vehicles do not have attacks, but they can-and may be required to-make vehicular bull rush, vehicular overrun, and ramming combat maneuvers.</li></list></text>\n            ","_id":"QOmspsqZv8UfKoTj"}

This code extends not only to the samurai's lord and master, but also to his comrades and family. Samurai who follow the order of the warrior are among the most trusted and feared warriors in the land.</p><p><b>Edicts:</b> The samurai must protect the life and lands of his lord with his life. He must be truthful and courageous, respectful to his elders and his masters, and loyal to his friends and liege. He must conduct himself with honor and dignity.</p><p><b>Challenge:</b> Whenever an order of the warrior samurai declares a challenge, he receives damage reduction 1/- against attacks made by the target of his challenge. This DR increases by +1 for every four levels the samurai possesses.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> An order of the warrior samurai adds Knowledge (history) (Int) and Knowledge (nobility) (Int) to his list of class skills. An order of the warrior samurai can make Knowledge (nobility) checks untrained. If he has ranks in the skill, he receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his samurai level (minimum +1) as long as the check involves the nobles or politics of his land.</p><p><b>Order Abilities:</b> A samurai who belongs to the order of the warrior gains the following abilities as he increases in level.</p><p><i>Honor in All Things (Ex):</i> At 2nd level, the order of the warrior samurai draws strength from his sense of honor. Whenever the samurai makes a skill check or saving throw, he can call upon his honor as a free action to grant him a +4 morale bonus on the roll. He can use this ability once per day at 2nd level, plus one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 2nd (maximum of five times per day at 18th level).</p><p><i>Way of the Samurai (Ex):</i> At 8th level, the order of the warrior samurai's sense of honor and loyalty drives him to accomplish seemingly impossible tasks. The samurai can, as a standard action, focus his mind and will. Once during the next minute, he can choose to roll an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw three times and take the best result. He must decide to use this ability before the roll is made. Using this ability expends one daily use of his resolve.</p><p><i>Strike True (Ex):</i> At 15th level, the order of the warrior samurai can use his years of training and focus to make the perfect strike. When he uses this ability, the samurai makes an attack as normal. If the attack hits, it is a critical threat. The samurai must roll to confirm the critical as normal. The attack deals the maximum amount of damage, although additional dice from weapon qualities, sneak attack, and additional dice from a critical hit are rolled normally. The damage from this attack ignores any damage reduction the target might have and also causes the target to become blinded, deafened, sickened, or staggered for 1d4 rounds (the samurai's choice). Making this attack is a standard action. The samurai can use this ability once per day.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"RS1FgW3Ifhgrgtcs"}

He drives pioneers back to civilization and strives to keep the land unspoiled.</p><p><b>Strong Senses (Ex):</b> At 1st level, a wild stalker's life among the wild has sharpened his senses. He gains low-light vision and a +1 bonus on Perception checks. If he already has low-light vision, he gains a +2 bonus on Perception checks instead.

The luring cavalier is a special type of cavalier that helps accomplish that goal. Typically, he uses a bow or other ranged weapon to lure opponents toward him, and then makes strategic retreats to position his enemies exactly where he wants them.</p><p><b>Far Challenge (Ex):</b> Once per day, a luring cavalier can use his far challenge ability as a swift action. When he does, the luring cavalier chooses one target within sight to challenge. The luring cavalier's ranged attacks deal extra damage whenever the attacks are made against the target of his challenge. This extra damage is equal to the luring cavalier's level. The luring cavalier can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day for every three levels beyond 1st, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level. Furthermore, once per day, the luring cavalier may spend a use of his far challenge ability to double the potential extra damage of his ranged attack. Before making the attack roll, he can choose to spend a use of his challenge to deal twice his cavalier level in extra damage on a successful hit instead of just his cavalier level in extra damage. If the attack misses, the use of the challenge is wasted.</p><p>Challenging a foe requires subtle deceits and strategies. The cavalier must make it look like he is a soft target. The subject of the far challenge gains a +4 bonus on attack rolls made against him.</p><p>This challenge remains in effect until the target is dead or unconscious, until the target hits the luring cavalier with a melee attack, or until the combat ends. If this challenge ends because the target hits the luring cavalier with a melee attack, this challenge changes to the effects of the normal cavalier challenge, and gains any order benefit the luring cavalier has. Far challenge replaces the challenge ability.</p><p><b>Careful Aim (Ex):</b> At 3rd level, when a luring cavalier makes a ranged attack with his highest base attack bonus, he can ignore the penalties for firing up to three range increments away. If he is using a firearm, he can target touch AC up to two range increments away. This effect stacks with effects that allow the cavalier to make ranged attacks farther without penalty or that allow him to target touch AC with a firearm beyond the first range increment. This ability replaces cavalier's charge.</p><p><b>Infuriating Aim (Ex):</b> At 11th level, when a luring cavalier confirms a critical hit with a ranged attack made at his highest base attack bonus against the target of a far challenge, the target becomes infuriated for 1 round. While infuriated, the target must spend its turn moving closer to the cavalier, making move, run, or charge actions only (challenged creature's choice). This is a mind-affecting effect. This ability replaces mighty charge.</p><p><b>Versatile Challenge (Ex):</b> At 12th level, a luring cavalier can expend a use of his challenge to gain the benefit of far challenge or the normal cavalier challenge. He can even change the type of challenge an opponent is under the effects of as a swift action, as long as the target of the challenge is within line of sight.</p><p><b>Supreme Aim (Ex):</b> At 20th level, the luring cavalier gains the careful aim bonus and the effect of infuriating aim on all ranged attacks.

A kensai is not proficient with armor or shields and suffers normal arcane spell failure chance when casting magus spells while armored.</p><p><b>Diminished Spellcasting:</b> A kensai may cast one fewer spell of each level than normal. If this reduces the number to 0, he may cast spells of that level only if his Intelligence allows bonus spells of that level.</p><p><b>Canny Defense (Ex):</b> At 1st level, when a kensai is wielding his chosen weapon, he gains the canny defense ability. This is identical to the duelist prestige class ability of the same name (Core Rulebook 382), save that his chosen weapon may be of any type.</p><p><b>Weapon Focus (Ex):</b> At 1st level, a kensai gains Weapon Focus with his chosen weapon as a bonus feat.</p><p><b>Perfect Strike (Ex):</b> At 4th level, when a kensai hits with his chosen weapon, he can spend 1 point from his arcane pool in order to maximize his weapon damage. Don't roll for damage-the weapon deals maximum damage. This affects only the weapon's base damage dice, not additional damage from sneak attack, magical weapon properties, spellstrike, or critical hits.</p><p>If the kensai confirms a critical hit, he can instead spend 2 points from his arcane pool to increase his weapon's critical multiplier by 1. This ability replaces spell recall.</p><p><b>Fighter Training (Ex):</b> Starting at 7th level, a kensai counts his magus level -3 as his fighter level for the purpose of qualifying for feats (if he has levels in fighter, these levels stack), but forfeits the benefit of such feats with weapons other than his favored weapon. This ability replaces knowledge pool.</p><p><b>Iaijutsu (Ex):</b> At 7th level, a kensai applies his Intelligence modifier as well as his Dexterity modifier on initiative rolls (minimum 0). A kensai may make attacks of opportunity when flat-footed, and may draw his favored weapon as a free action as part of taking an attack of opportunity. This ability replaces the medium armor ability.</p><p><b>Critical Perfection (Ex):</b> At 9th level, a kensai adds his Intelligence bonus (minimum 0) on critical hit confirmation rolls with his favored weapon. In addition, the kensai may use his magus levels in place of his base attack bonuses to qualify for Critical Focus and any feat for which it is a prerequisite; these feats apply only with a kensai's favored weapon. This ability replaces the magus arcana normally gained at 9th level.</p><p><b>Superior Reflexes (Ex):</b> At 11th level, kensai can make a number of attacks of opportunity in a round equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). This effect stacks with the Combat Reflexes feat. This ability replaces improved spell recall.</p><p><b>Iaijutsu Focus (Ex):</b> At 13th level, a kensai may always act and may draw his weapon as a swift action during a surprise round, though he is considered flat-footed until he acts. During a surprise round or when attacking a flat-footed opponent, he adds his Intelligence modifier on damage with his chosen weapon (minimum 0). This ability replaces heavy armor.</p><p><b>Iaijutsu Master (Ex):</b> At 19th level, a kensai's initiative roll is automatically a natural 20 and he is never surprised. This ability replaces greater spell access.</p><p><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex):</b> At 20th level, a kensai gains weapon mastery with his favored weapon, as the fighter class ability. This ability replaces true magus.</p><p><b>Magus Arcana:</b> The following magus arcana complement the kensai archetype: concentrate*, critical strike*, deadly follow-up, precise prowess, prescient attack, prescient defense, spell shield*.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"UTZcBtH7CQSA34Gg"}

The ammunition description specifies which types of siege engines use the special ammunition. The costs and weights on Table 3-14 are for individual uses of special ammunition.</p><h1>TABLE 3-14: SPECIAL SIEGE ENGINE AMMUNITION</h1><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Ammunition</b></td><td><b>Cost</b></td><td><b>Weight</b></td></tr><tr><td>Alchemist's fire</td><td>200 gp</td><td>10 lbs.</td></tr><tr><td>Blast shot</td><td>30 gp</td><td>25 lbs.</td></tr><tr><td>Bomb</td><td>600 gp</td><td>30 lbs.</td></tr><tr><td>Chain shot</td><td>50 gp</td><td>30 lbs. </td></tr><tr><td>Liquid ice</td><td>400 gp</td><td>20 lbs.</td></tr><tr><td>Plague bundle</td><td>80 gp</td><td>20 lbs.</td></tr><tr><td>Smoke shot</td><td>250 gp</td><td>20 lbs.</td></tr></table><p><b>Alchemical Fire:</b> This hard, ceramic canister of alchemist's fire can be used as ammunition in catapults and trebuchets. When it hits its target square, it deals 4d6 points of fire damage to each creature and wooden structure within 5 feet of the target space, and each creature must make a DC 20 Reflex saving throw or catch on fire (wooden objects automatically catch on fire). Every creature and wooden object within the area between 5 and 30 feet of the target space must make a DC 20 Reflex saving throw or take half the fire damage, but they do not catch on fire. On a siege engine mishap, this ammunition explodes before it is launched, dealing its damage to the siege engine and all nearby creatures and wooden objects as if one of the spaces of the siege engine (crew leader's choice) were the target square. This alchemical fire ignores the hardness of wooden objects.</p><p><b>Blast Shot:</b> Instead of a single hard ball, this ammunition is a bundle of large pellets, balls, or pieces of scrap metal, propelled a short distance by black powder and attacking all creatures and objects within an area. Both cannons and fiend's mouth cannons can fire this kind of ammunition. When such a siege engine fires this ammunition, it hits every creature and object within a 30-foot-cone burst. The siege engine makes attack rolls against each creature and unattended object in the burst. It must miss every creature or target to misfire, and a misfire generates the normal effect. It deals its normal damage on a hit, but does not ignore the hardness of objects.</p><p><b>Bomb:</b> A bomb is a metal canister filled with metal balls and black powder that can be used as ammunition in catapults and trebuchets or carried by two Medium creatures or one Large creature to its destination. A bomb either explodes on impact (if fired from a catapult or trebuchet, or within 3 rounds of a fuse being lit if carried). When it explodes, it deals 6d6 points of piercing and bludgeoning damage to all creatures and objects within 30 feet of the target square. On a siege engine mishap, this ammunition explodes before it is launched, dealing its damage to the siege engine and all nearby creatures and wooden objects as if one of the spaces of the siege engine (crew leader's choice) were the target square. It ignores the hardness of wood and stone.</p><p><b>Chain Shot:</b> This siege engine firearm ammunition can be loaded in a cannon or a fiend's mouth cannon. It is especially good at tearing through sails and dirigibles (see Chapter 4: Vehicles), dealing double its normal damage to those forms of propulsion. When fired at a creature, on a hit, the creature must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or be knocked prone.</p><p><b>Liquid Ice:</b> This hard, ceramic canister filled with alchemical liquid ice can be used as ammunition in catapults and trebuchets. When it hits its target square, it deals 4d6 points of cold damage to each creature within 5 feet of the targeting space, and each creature must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or become entangled for 1 round. Every creature within the area between 5 and 30 feet of the target space must make a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or take half damage. On a siege engine mishap, this ammunition explodes before it is launched, dealing its damage to all nearby creatures as if one of the spaces of the siege engine (crew leader's choice) were the target square.</p><p><b>Plague Bundle:</b> This hard, ceramic canister is filled with a noxious mass of diseased carrion and offal that can be used as ammunition for a catapult or a trebuchet. It deals only half damage, but every creature hit by it is exposed to filth fever (Core Rulebook 557). A GM might allow a plague bundle to inflict other diseases.</p><p><b>Smoke Shot:</b> This hard ceramic sphere contains two alchemical substances separated by a thin barrier, much like a smoke pellet (Advanced Player's Guide 185) in larger form. When it hits the targeting space, it deals 2d6 points of damage to any creature in that space, and the substances mingle and then create an area of foul but harmless yellow smoke radiating 30 feet from the target square. Treat the effect as a fog cloud spell. On a siege engine mishap, the ammunition explodes before it is launched. Its effect is centered on one of the spaces of the siege engine (crew leader's choice).</p></text>\n            ","_id":"Vmp42YNgAdOHuJyJ"}

Even when a setting otherwise uses Medieval Europe as its primary analogue, there's something about the elegance and specialization of Eastern armor and weapons-and in some cases the powerful traditions and discipline of their users-that calls to players and characters of all backgrounds.</p><p>This section begins with a discussion of Eastern armor. Few images of combat are as iconic as that of a samurai in traditional o-yoroi armor charging across the battlefield, his ferocious kabuto helmet turning his face into that of a creature from legend or nightmare. Yet there's far more to Eastern armor than simply the lamellar of the samurai. From ceremonial silken armor to four-mirror armor and the weighty stone coats, this section provides a broad overview of the category.</p><p>Next, this section provides a bevy of new weapons drawn from the cultures referenced above, many perfectly suited for monks, but all useful for a variety of character classes. Weapons presented in this section range from the legendary katanas and wakizashi of the honorable samurai to the fighting fans and poisoned sand tubes of courtier spies and assassins, from the simple but lightning-fast tonfas to the bizarre urumi whip-swords whose sharpened ribbons of metal are flexible enough to be coiled up and worn as belts.</p><p>Characters need not always be of an Eastern-inspired class-such as the ninja or the samurai-or have a background in an Asian-fantasy-inspired nation to take advantage of these expanded choices. An unusual or exotic weapon gained during the course of a hero's adventures or inherited from a relative or mentor with a mysterious past is an easy way to help an otherwise European-inspired character expand his background and stand out from the crowd. In many ways, the character who fights with a completely normal kusarigama might seem as exotic to his opponents and admirers as one who fights with a magical longsword, and weapons that strike onlookers as unusual go a long way toward assisting gladiators and other performance fighters in distinguishing themselves on the field-one of the primary reasons why those warriors often choose strange and unique arms and armaments for their battles.</p><p>This exoticism also provides a very real advantage when it comes to the combat itself: if an enemy has never seen a particular weapon before, he's much less likely to be able to defend against it effectively, and many of the new weapons presented in this section have unique or specialized uses and tactics which aren't immediately apparent to opponents.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"XQnBiFfhSnibwIUq"}

Unless stated otherwise in an individual siege engine description, all siege engines use the following rules.</p><p><b>Proficiency:</b> Siege engines are exotic weapons. A creature with the Siege Engineer feat (see page 118) is proficient with all siege engines, including siege firearms. A creature that is proficient in firearms is also proficient in siege firearms, but not other siege engines.</p><p><b>Crew:</b> The sheer size of a siege engine often necessitates a crew for its use. One person of that crew is the crew leader. Usually the crew leader targets or controls the movement of a siege engine; sometimes the crew leader does both. Often the crew leader is required to take actions and make specific checks in order for a siege engine to function. The rest of the crew members are required to spend actions and make checks in order for a siege engine to function.</p><p>The number of members in a crew assumes Medium creatures. A ram can be crewed by Small creatures, but it takes double the crew to do the same job. If Large or larger creatures serve as crew members, each Large creature counts as four crew members, a Huge creature counts as eight Medium creatures, a colossal creature counts as 16 Medium creatures, and a gargantuan creature counts as 20 Medium creatures.</p><p><b>Magical and Masterwork Siege Engines:</b> Siege engines can be masterwork, increasing their Craft DC by 5 and costing an additional 300 gp. A masterwork siege engine can be enchanted at twice the cost for a normal magical weapon. The enhancement bonus of a siege engine applies on attack rolls and targeting checks (in the case of indirect ranged siege engines), and in the case of magical spell engines, the enhancement bonus also applies on damage rolls.</p><p><b>Defense and Hit Points:</b> All siege engines are objects. A siege engine has a Dexterity of 0 (-5 penalty) and a further penalty based on its size. Each type of siege engine has its own hardness and hit points. Siege engines can be armored-treat the siege engine as a creature of its size to determine the cost of the armor. Masterwork siege engine armor can be enchanted for twice the normal cost to enchant armor. Armored siege engines have an AC equal to that normally granted by the specific armor (shields have no effect on a siege engine), a hardness and hit points equal to that of the armor, and bonus hit points equal to the armor bonus × 5.</p><p><b>Moving Siege Engines:</b> Siege engines have a speed. The speed of a siege engine is the distance it can be moved if its full crew makes a move action to move it. Some siege engines have a speed of 0. If this is the case, the engine must be dissembled before movement is possible, or else mounted on a vehicle. Siege engines that are atop or mounted on vehicles move with those vehicles (see Chapter 4: Vehicles).</p><p><b>Ranged Attacks:</b> Unlike normal ranged weapons, siege engines do not deal half damage when attacking objects.</p><p><b>Critical Hits:</b> When a direct-fire siege engine or a close assault siege engine scores a critical hit, it confirms the critical and deals critical hit damage just like any other weapon. If an indirect-fire ranged siege engine rolls a natural 20 on its targeting check, it can also score a critical hit. The crew leader must reroll the targeting check to confirm the critical. If the confirmation targeting check is successful, the attack is a critical hit, and the siege engine multiplies its damage by its critical multiplier. Unlike normal attacks, siege engines attacks can deal critical hit damage to objects. Siege engines do not gain the benefit of critical feats the crew or the crew leader may have.</p><p><b>Mishaps and Misfires:</b> Rolling a natural 1 on an attack roll or a targeting check made by an indirect-fire ranged siege engine produces a mishap. Usually a mishap applies the broken condition. A non-firearm siege engine with the broken condition takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, targeting checks, and damage rolls. It also moves at half its normal speed.</p><p>If the creature that serves as crew leader has the Siege Engineer feat, that creature does not generate a mishap on a natural 1 when firing the siege engine.</p><p>Firearm siege weapons do not gain a mishap on a natural 1, but instead have a misfire value, like other firearms do. An attack roll or targeting check that falls within the misfire range causes the firearm siege engine to misfire. A misfire always misses, and applies the broken condition to the siege engine firearm. A firearm siege weapon with the broken condition takes all of the penalties and limitations that non-firearm siege engines do, and the misfire range of the firearm siege engine is increased by 4. If the firearm siege engine already has the broken condition when it misfires, it explodes. When a firearm siege engine explodes, it deals its damage to all creatures within a blast range (those within the blast can attempt a DC 20 Reflex save for half damage). The normal misfire range of a firearm siege engine and its blast range are given in the individual firearm siege engine description. Crew leaders with the Siege Engineer feat do not lower the misfire value of firearm siege engines.</p><p><b>Constructing and Repairing Siege Engines:</b> A siege engine is a complex device requiring a DC 20 Craft (siege engine) skill check to build or repair.</p><p><b>Disabling Siege Engines:</b> A siege engine is considered a difficult device to disable, requiring 2d4 rounds of effort and a DC 20 Disable Device check to do so. When a siege engine is disabled, it either doesn't work or is sabotaged and stops working 1d4 minutes after use. Fixing a disabled siege engine requires a DC 20 Craft (siege engine), Disable Device, or Knowledge (engineering) check. It takes 10 minutes to fix the device, and the check can be retried if the fix fails.</p><p><b>Assembling Siege Engines:</b> Siege engines are broken down for transport and can be reassembled on the battlefield, requiring the time and number of workers noted below. Each assembly worker must make a DC 10 Craft (siege engine) check; if untrained, they may not take 10. Assembly can be performed with at least half the required number of workers by doubling the time required. If fewer than half are available, the weapon cannot be assembled.#h;FIX ME</p><h1>TABLE 3-11: SIEGE ENGINE ASSEMBLY</h1><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Engine Size</b></td><td><b>Time Required</b></td><td><b>Workers Required</b></td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>1 minute</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>10 minutes</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>1 hour</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>2 hours</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>4 hours</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>8 hours</td><td>12</td></tr></table></text>\n            ","_id":"XfB9pPbhFbFoOtMV"}

While many fighters hone their weapon skills to a point of inescapable grace and lethality, there are those who live under the maxim that a good offense can be accomplished though an impenetrable defense. To these fighters, proper use of armor and shields ensures that they can fight another day, and that the frustration of enemies who can't seem to crack an armor master's superior defenses is just the first symptom of his foes' eventual defeat.</p><p><b>Deflective Shield (Ex):</b> At 2nd level, an armor master specializes in using his shield to deflect attacks. He gains a +1 bonus to his touch AC, and this bonus increases for every four levels beyond 2nd (to a maximum of +6 at 20th level); however, this bonus cannot exceed the sum of the armor and enhancement bonus to AC provided by the shield that the armor master is currently carrying. This ability replaces bravery.</p><p><b>Armored Defense (Ex):</b> At 5th level, an armor master gains DR 1/- when wearing light armor, DR 2/- when wearing medium armor, and DR 3/- when wearing heavy armor. At 19th level, this damage reduction increases to DR 4/- when wearing light armor, DR 8/- when wearing medium armor, and DR 12/- when wearing heavy armor. This damage reduction stacks with that provided by adamantine armor, but not with other forms of damage reduction. This damage reduction does not apply if the armor master is stunned, unconscious, or helpless. This ability replaces weapon training 1 and 3, and armor mastery.</p><p><b>Fortification (Ex):</b> At 9th level, an armor master can use his armor to shield critical areas from injury. He treats any armor he wears as if it had the light fortification special ability (Core Rulebook 463). At 13th level, his armor gains the moderate fortification special ability. This fortification does not stack in any way with armor that has these special abilities. In these cases the armor master takes the better of the two fortifications. This ability replaces weapon training 2 and 4.</p><p><b>Indestructible (Ex):</b> At 20th level, an armor master gains complete immunity to critical hits and sneak attacks while he is wearing armor. In addition, unless his armor has the fragile armor quality, it cannot be sundered while he is wearing it. This ability replaces weapon mastery.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"Y2kXcn5tGex6L92B"}

For instance, it is not unheard of for warriors to combine chain mail with four-mirror armor (see, the variant piecemeal armor rules on pages 198-205). Only the various types of plate mail would be either rare or unfamiliar in an Asian-inspired setting.</p><p><b>Do-Maru:</b> The lightest of all samurai armors, do-maru wraps around your body like a short armored coat. It consists primarily of lamellar and lacks a solid breastplate or sleeves. This permits you greater flexibility than do heavier armors.</p><p><b>Four-Mirror Armor:</b> This armor consists of four plates harnessed together with leather shoulder straps. Two round plates protect your front and back, while two smaller rectangular plates cover the sides of the torso. Four-mirror armor is worn over chainmail to provide added protection, and comes with a spiked helmet with a chainmail hood.</p><p><b>Haramaki:</b> Also called a belly-warmer, a haramaki is a simple silken sash lined with chainmail or articulated metal plates and tied about the stomach to protect it.</p><p><b>Kikko Armor:</b> Kikko armor consists of hexagonal plates made from iron and sewn to cloth. The plates may be hidden by a layer of cloth or left exposed.</p><p><b>Kusari Gusoku:</b> Kusari gusoku is similar to tatami-do armor; however, a katabira-a type of chain jacket-is worn in place of the chest armor.</p><p><b>Lamellar Armor:</b> Lamellar is a type of armor in which small plates of various types of materials are strung together in parallel rows using fine cord. Lamellar plates can be constructed from lacquered leather, horn, or even stone, though steel and heavier iron are most common. Lamellar armor can be crafted into various shapes, including partial pieces such as breastplates, greaves, or even entire coats. The properties of specific suits and pieces of lamellar armor are determined by their material.</p><p><b>Lamellar Cuirass:</b> This armor consists of a light breastplate and shoulder guards made from lacquered leather plates bound together and fitted over a silk shirt.</p><p><b>Mountain Pattern Armor:</b> This medium armor consists of hundreds of small, interlocking pieces of steel shaped to resemble an ancient symbol for the word \"mountain.\" The mail is then riveted to a cloth or leather backing. It is worn like a mail coat and covers your torso, shoulders, and thighs.</p><p><b>O-Yoroi:</b> Worn almost exclusively by high-ranking samurai, o-yoroi-or \"great armor\"-is a heavy combat armor that consists of various supplementary components that include both plate and lamellar elements. Each suit is crafted for a specific individual and displays the owner's aesthetic. Upon completion, the suit is colored and sealed with a final lacquer finish. The centerpiece of o-yoroi is a cuirass consisting of two parts-a separate reinforcement for the right side called a waidate, and a kikko cuirass. The upper part of the waidate consists of a leather-covered iron plate. The cuirass's leather shoulder straps-called watagami-are likewise armored with metal plates. Affixed to the cuirass are a number of supplementary pieces, including wide lamellar shoulder guards, a kikko sleeve for the shield arm, lacquered iron greaves worn over padded silk leggings, and a groin protector. Still, the signature component of each suit of armor is the tiered kabuto helmet and its accompanying ho-ate mask. Ho-ate masks can be made of hardened leather or metal and are fashioned into fearsome visages such as oni, dragons, or other mythical beings.</p><p><b>Silken Ceremonial Armor:</b> Used for ceremonial displays or occasionally worn (albeit with no additional benefit) over heavier armor, these robes consist of several layers of cloth and an outer layer of silk intricately woven with gold brocade designs and covered with metal studs.</p><p><b>Tatami-Do:</b> Worn by samurai as a lighter-weight alternative to o-yoroi, tatami-do is a full-body field armor that combines both metal lamellar and kikko components into a suit of mail with a cloth backing. It typically includes a collapsible kabuto helmet or an armored hood, as well as arm, shoulder, and thigh guards.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"YQXhivlhZTbhRglK"}

When a gate gains the broken condition, it is effectively breached, and can be moved through as if it were an opening one size smaller.</p><h1>TABLE 3-20: GATES</h1><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b></b></td><td><b></b></td><td><b></b></td><td colspan=\"4\"><b>Hit Points</b></td></tr><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Material</b></td><td><b>Break DC [1]</b></td><td><b>Hardness</b></td><td><b>Large</b></td><td><b>Huge</b></td><td><b>Colossal</b></td><td><b>Gargantuan</b></td></tr><tr><td>Wood</td><td>35</td><td>5</td><td>60</td><td>135</td><td>240</td><td>540</td></tr><tr><td>Stone</td><td>38</td><td>8</td><td>100</td><td>225</td><td>400</td><td>900</td></tr><tr><td>Iron or steel</td><td>24</td><td>10</td><td>200</td><td>500</td><td>800</td><td>1,800</td></tr><tr><td>Adamantine</td><td>48</td><td>20</td><td>280</td><td>630</td><td>1,120</td><td>2,520</td></tr></table><p>[1] The DC assumes the gate is size Large and is barred and locked.

There are even those who mistake them for monks, but these fighters enter the fight without ki, and instead have a tough perseverance that few can rival.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> An unarmed fighter is not proficient with medium armor, heavy armor, or shields. An unarmed fighter is proficient with all monk weapons, including exotic monk weapons.</p><p><b>Unarmed Style:</b> At 1st level, a unarmed fighter gains the Improved Unarmed Strike feat and any single style feat (see Chapter 3) as a bonus feat. The unarmed fighter need not meet all the prerequisites of the style feat he chooses, but style feats that grant additional uses of the Elemental Fist feat cannot be taken until the unarmed fighter has that feat. This ability replaces the bonus feat at 1st level.</p><p><b>Harsh Training (Ex):</b> At 2nd level, an unarmed fighter gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against effects that cause the exhausted, fatigued, or staggered conditions or temporary penalties to ability scores. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels after 2nd (to a maximum of +5 at 18th level). This ability replaces bravery.</p><p><b>Tough Guy (Ex):</b> At 3rd level, an unarmed fighter gains DR/- equal to half his fighter level against nonlethal damage or damage taken while he is grappled. This ability replaces armor training 1.</p><p><b>Weapon Training (Ex):</b> At 5th level, an unarmed fighter gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with weapons in the monk and natural weapon groups, improving by +1 for every four levels beyond 5th (to a maximum of +4 at 17th level). This ability replaces weapon training 1, 2, 3, and 4.</p><p><b>Clever Wrestler (Ex):</b> At 7th level, an unarmed fighter takes no penalties to Dexterity or on attack rolls while grappled, and retains his Dexterity bonus to AC while pinning an opponent. The unarmed fighter can make attacks of opportunity even when grappled and even against creatures attempting to grapple him if the opponent has the Improved Grapple feat or the grab ability. This ability replaces armor training 2.</p><p><b>Trick Throw (Ex):</b> At 9th level, when an unarmed fighter successfully trips an opponent with an unarmed attack, he can attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver against that creature (before the opponent becomes prone) as an immediate action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. This ability replaces weapon training 2.</p><p><b>Takedown (Ex):</b> At 11th level, if an unarmed fighter succeeds on a drag maneuver, he can attempt a trip maneuver against the same target as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. At 15th level, he may do so after a successful grapple check. This ability replaces armor training 3.</p><p><b>Eye Gouge (Ex):</b> At 13th level, if an unarmed fighter confirms a critical hit with his unarmed strike or begins his turn grappled, he may attempt a dirty trick maneuver to blind his target as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A target more than one size category larger is unaffected. This ability replaces weapon training 3.</p><p><b>Sucker Punch (Ex):</b> At 17th level, when an unarmed fighter strikes a creature that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, or that he has successfully pinned with a grapple check, he can attempt a dirty trick or trip combat maneuver against that target as a swift action. This ability replaces armor training 4.</p><p><b>Sheer Toughness (Ex):</b> At 19th level, an unarmed fighter becomes immune to nonlethal damage and the exhausted, fatigued, and staggered conditions.

The following are broad categories of firearm rarity and the rules that govern them. Pathfinder's world of Golarion uses the rules for emerging guns, which is also the default category of gun rarity detailed in this Pathfinder RPG supplement.</p><p><b>No Guns:</b> If you do not want guns in your campaign, simply don't allow the rules that follow. The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game plays perfectly well without them.</p><p><b>Very Rare Guns:</b> Early firearms are rare; advanced firearms, the gunslinger class, the Amateur Gunslinger feat, and archetypes that use the firearm rules do not exist in this type of campaign. Firearms are treated more like magic items-things of wonder and mystery-rather than like things that are mass-produced. Few know the strange secrets of firearm creation. Only NPCs can take the Gunsmithing feat.</p><p><b>Emerging Guns:</b> Firearms become more common. They are mass-produced by small guilds, lone gunsmiths, dwarven clans, or maybe even a nation or two-the secret is slipping out, and the occasional rare adventurer uses guns. The baseline gunslinger rules and the prices for ammunition given in this chapter are for this type of campaign. Early firearms are available, but are relatively rare. Adventurers who want to use guns must take the Craft Firearms feat just to make them feasible weapons. Advanced firearms may exist, but only as rare and wondrous items-the stuff of high-level treasure troves.</p><p><b>Commonplace Guns:</b> While still expensive and tricky to wield, early firearms are readily available. Instead of requiring the Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat, all firearms are martial weapons. Early firearms and their ammunition cost 25% of the amounts listed in this book, but advanced firearms and their ammunition are still rare and cost the full price to purchase or craft.</p><p><b>Guns Everywhere:</b> Guns are commonplace. Early firearms are seen as antiques, and advanced firearms are widespread. Firearms are simple weapons, and early firearms, advanced guns, and their ammunition are bought or crafted for 10% of the cost listed in this chapter. The gunslinger loses the gunsmith class feature and instead gains the gun training class feature at 1st level.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"Yk2gFi35tBMb1Dlw"}

Countless monastic and contemplative orders have crafted intricate unarmed fighting styles based on the deadliness and grace of natural and supernatural creatures. Although many such fighting techniques were created by secretive orders, they have since spread to practitioners the world over.</p><p>As a swift action, you can enter the stance employed by the fighting style a style feat embodies. Although you cannot use a style feat before combat begins, the style you are in persists until you spend a swift action to switch to a different combat style. You can use a feat that has a style feat as a prerequisite only while in the stance of the associated style. For example, if you have feats associated with Mantis Style and Tiger Style, you can use a swift action to adopt Tiger Style at the start of one turn, and then can use other feats that have Tiger Style as a prerequisite. By using another swift action at the start of your next turn, you could adopt Mantis Style and use other feats that have Mantis Style as a prerequisite.</p><p>The styles presented in this book follow, along with specific feat paths-feats that complement each style.</p><p><b>Boar Style:</b> A tribe of orcs who disdained the use of weapons originally developed this savage unarmed fighting style. They preferred to slaughter their enemies with their bare hands and teeth. Over the centuries, a variety of races have adopted the Boar Style, most notably goblinoids, ogres, and trolls. The objective of the Boar Style is to attack with as much viciousness and cruelty as possible in order to break enemy morale. Fanatical followers of the style use herbal and alchemical reagents to harden their nails and teeth, sometimes performing self-mutilating procedures that result in clawlike nails and sharpened teeth.</p><p><i>Feat Path:</i> Boar Style, Boar Ferocity, Boar Shred.</p><p><b>Crane Style:</b> Crane style focuses on defense and agile counterattacks. Practitioners are known for graceful, one-legged stances and folding arm techniques that mimic a crane's enormous wings.</p><p><i>Feat Path:</i> Crane Style, Crane Wing, Crane Riposte.</p><p><b>Djinni Style:</b> Adherents to this style call on the spirits of storms to outmaneuver and outwit their opponents. Masters of the style can absorb and deflect electrical attacks while summoning peals of thunder to pummel their enemies.</p><p><i>Feat Path:</i> Djinni Style, Djinni Spirit, Djinni Spin.</p><p><b>Dragon Style:</b> Dragon style captures the overwhelming power, grace, and ferocity of dragons. Practitioners use acrobatic footwork and strong attacks to overwhelm foes. The deepest secrets of the style require imbibing alchemical tonics and deep meditations similar to the long sleeps of dragons.</p><p><i>Feats Path:</i> Dragon Style, Dragon Ferocity, Dragon Roar.</p><p><b>Earth Child Style:</b> A warrior cadre of dwarves and gnomes dedicated to fighting and slaying giants developed this style. Students of the style learn how to enhance their defensive training to become even more elusive when facing giants. They also spend long hours studying the anatomy of the various giant races to increase the effectiveness of their unarmed strikes. Eventually, masters of this fighting style learn how to bring down even the mightiest creatures by targeting feet, ankles, and knees.</p><p><i>Feat Path:</i> Earth Child Style, Earth Child Topple, Earth Child Binder.</p><p><b>Efreeti Style:</b> The efreeti style focuses on aggression and speed, taking inspiration from beings of living fire. Masters of the style can deflect and control fire, immolate their enemies, and summon forth gouts of elemental flame.</p><p><i>Feats Path:</i> Efreeti Style, Efreeti Stance, Efreeti Touch.</p><p><b>Janni Style:</b> This style, originating humbly from the folk traditions of disparate peoples, represents several similar unarmed fighting arts practiced around the world. Regardless of variations in technique, all practitioners have a fluid fighting stance that emphasizes rapid, powerful kicks. The style's constant motion and graceful footwork lead many to mistakenly view practitioners as highly skilled dancers, a misconception that has allowed the technique to be taught in secret, the hidden weapon of the downtrodden and the oppressed. Openly martial versions of this style lose some of the dancelike qualities but retain the style's extraordinary kicking techniques and agility.</p><p><i>Feat Path:</i> Janni Style, Janni Tempest, Janni Rush.</p><p><b>Kirin Style:</b> The school of the kirin employs critical observations as weapons against opponents. Practitioners catalogue a foe's weaknesses and seek the perfect moment to strike, ensuring that no movement or effort is ever wasted. Popular among those rare orders that blend monastic training with arcane study, kirin style is sometimes practiced by wizards who seek to hone their bodies along with their minds.</p><p><i>Feat Path:</i> Kirin Style, Kirin Strike, Kirin Path.</p><p><b>Mantis Style:</b> Based on the hunting techniques of the praying mantis, practitioners of this style fight with their hands turned down to emulate the insect's sharp grasping forelimbs. Mantis style uses precise, accurate strikes to pinpoint an opponent's vital areas, such as eyes, throat, and pressure points.</p><p><i>Feat Path:</i> Mantis Style, Mantis Wisdom, Mantis Torment.</p><p><b>Marid Style:</b> Marid style emulates the fluid strength of flowing rivers and the cold of the ocean depths. Masters of the style can withstand severe cold, manipulate water to lash at enemies from afar, and freeze their foes in place.</p><p><i>Feat Path:</i> Marid Style, Marid Spirit, Marid Coldsnap.</p><p><b>Monkey Style:</b> Renowned for its speed and agility, monkey style blends jumping strikes, rolling blows, and ground fighting into a continuous onslaught aimed at disorienting and damaging an opponent through superior mobility.</p><p><i>Feat Path:</i> Monkey Style, Monkey Moves, Monkey Shine.</p><p><b>Panther Style:</b> Students of the panther throw caution to the wind as they weave recklessly among their foes. Those who master the style turn their unrivaled mobility into a weapon, striking their enemies with a series of swift retaliatory strikes.</p><p><i>Feat Path:</i> Panther Style, Panther Claws, Panther Parry.</p><p><b>Shaitan Style:</b> Practitioners of this style imbue their fists with the mineral acids of the deep earth. Their forceful blows conjure forth caustic elements to dissolve and disable their enemies.</p><p><i>Feat Path:</i> Shaitan Style, Shaitan Skin, Shaitan Earthblast.</p><p><b>Snake Style:</b> Snake style emphasizes quick, shifting movements. Its practitioners normally hold their hands flat with the fingers together to mimic the head of a snake. Able to strike when least expected, snake stylists are known for opportunism and blinding speed.</p><p><i>Feat Path:</i> Snake Style, Snake Sidewinder, Snake Fang.</p><p><b>Snapping Turtle Style:</b> The snapping turtle style emphasizes active defense with one hand. Students of the style utilize a variety of locks, grabs, and circular blocks to</p><p>protect themselves, as well as employing a debilitating clutch.</p><p><i>Feat Path:</i> Snapping Turtle Style, Snapping Turtle Clutch, Snapping Turtle Shell.</p><p><b>Tiger Style:</b> This style seeks to emulate the power and fury of the great tiger. Practitioners use their hands like claws, perfecting overpowering double hand strikes and driving attack chains.</p><p><i>Feat Path:</i> Tiger Style, Tiger Claws, Tiger Pounce.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"ZLJSofAcJ89IEJzL"}

Generally, a creature can't be blinded until it has lost all vision in all of its eyes. Creatures with five or more eyes take no penalties from called shots to their eyes until they're blinded in enough eyes to bring them down a single functional eye, but can still be blinded in that eye by a critical hit or debilitating blow. Called shots to the eye are challenging (-10 penalty).</p><p><b>Called Shot:</b> A called shot to the eye gives all of the target's foes concealment against its attacks for 1 round and gives it a -2 penalty on Perception checks. If the creature only has one functional eye prior to the called shot, it is blinded for 1 round instead.</p><p><b>Critical Called Shot:</b> A critical hit to the eye costs the target sight in that eye for 1d4 minutes.

The hook allows you to make trip attacks at range. Some aklyses have holes drilled through them and whistle when flung.</p><p><b>Amentum:</b> An amentum is a long leather thong that attaches to a javelin. Before throwing, the amentum is wound about the javelin's shaft. You then throw the javelin while gripping the amentum, imparting spin to the weapon and greatly improving its range. Attaching an amentum to a javelin is a move action, and winding it is a full-round action. Javelins can be stored with amenta already wound about them. A javelin wound with an amentum is considered a martial weapon.</p><p><b>Flying Blade:</b> A flying blade is a large, crescent-shaped blade anchored to a 10-foot chain. You fight with a flying blade by spinning it about your head or by snapping it toward an opponent. The flying blade is a clumsy weapon and receives a -2 penalty on attack rolls, but when you make attacks of opportunity provoked by movement, you receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls instead of the penalty.</p><p><b>Gladius:</b> The gladius is the favorite short sword of gladiators, with a heavier blade than the standard short sword. It serves well as a slashing weapon. Feats and abilities that affect short swords apply to the gladius.</p><p><b>Hooked Axe:</b> The hooked end of this axe's blade can be used to disarm foes or pull them off balance. A hooked axe can be used as a martial weapon (in which case it functions like a battleaxe).</p><p><b>Knuckle Axe:</b> Knuckle axes, usually used in pairs, resemble axe blades mounted on brass knuckles. You may hold, but not wield, a weapon or other object in a hand wearing a knuckle axe. Unlike when wearing brass knuckles, you cannot use a hand wearing a knuckle axe for spellcasting.</p><p><b>Madu:</b> The madu is a round, light shield with two animal horns-usually from an antelope-extending from opposite sides of the shield. If you are proficient with the madu, you may use it to fight defensively with a -2 penalty instead of the normal -4, and your attack penalty for using Combat Expertise improves by +1 (minimum -1 penalty). You cannot hold anything else in the hand that bears a madu. If you are not proficient with the madu, treat it as a light spiked shield.</p><p><b>Pata:</b> An evolution of the punching dagger, the pata is a short sword that ends in a full, fingerless gauntlet hilt. You punch rather than stab with the weapon, allowing you to put more force behind each strike. While wearing a pata, you cannot use that hand for anything else. A pata provides a +10 bonus to your CMD against being disarmed.</p><p><b>Quadrens:</b> A quadrens looks like a dagger, but with four spikes mounted in a square pattern in place of a blade. When you score a critical hit with a quadrens, the resulting gaping wound causes 1 point of bleed damage.</p><p><b>Scizore:</b> The scizore is a hardened tube that fits your forearm, ending in a semicircular blade used for devastating bladed punch attacks. The scizore grants a +1 shield bonus to AC, but if you attack with the blade, you lose the AC bonus that round and take a -1 penalty on attack rolls with the scizore. While wearing a scizore, you cannot use that hand for anything else. A scizore provides a +10 bonus to your CMD against being disarmed of your scizore. Donning a scizore is a full-round action.</p><p><b>Scorpion Whip:</b> This whip has a series of razor-sharp blades and fangs inset along its tip. It deals lethal damage, even to creatures with armor bonuses. If you are proficient with whips, you can use a scorpion whip as a whip.</p><p><b>Shotel:</b> The shotel is a downward-curving sword designed to reach over or around an opponent's shield. You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls with a shotel against opponents using bucklers, light shields, or heavy shields.</p><p><b>Sica:</b> This blade is a smaller, lighter version of the shotel. You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls with a sica against opponents using bucklers, light shields, or heavy shields.</p><p><b>Throwing Shield:</b> This shield is designed for throwing and has specially designed straps allowing you to unclasp and throw it as a free action. Tower shields cannot be throwing shields. Neither a shield's enhancement bonus to AC nor its shield spikes apply on your attack or damage rolls.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"crWU71WJlHqNfa4M"}

In the case of muscle propulsion, it is about guiding the creatures to move the vehicle. In the case of current propulsion, it is about using the current and tools like sails, oars, or a rudder to move the vehicle. With magic, it is typically about understanding the magic device that powers the propulsion and using the device properly.</p><p><b>Driving Actions:</b> A driver can, at the start of her turn, before taking any other action, take any of the following actions (except the \"uncontrolled\" action) to control a vehicle. If the driver does not take an action, takes another action, or delays or readies an action, she loses control of the vehicle and the vehicle takes the \"uncontrolled\" action.</p><p><i>Accelerate (standard action):</i> With a successful driving check, the vehicle's current speed increases up to its acceleration (in 5-foot increments; minimum 5 feet), but no higher than its maximum speed. The vehicle can move forward or forward diagonally. In other words, each time a vehicle enters a new 5-foot square, it can choose any of its forward-facing squares-the ones directly in front or either of the squares directly forward and diagonal. This allows the vehicle to swerve. A driver who fails her driving check can only move into squares directly in front of the vehicle's forward facing.</p><p><i>Decelerate (standard action):</i> With a successful driving check, the vehicle's current speed decreases by a rate up to its acceleration (in 5-foot increments; minimum 5 feet). On a failed check, the vehicle does not decelerate. Either way, the vehicle can move forward diagonally. If deceleration reduces a vehicle's speed to 0, some amount of inertia will continue to move the vehicle forward. The vehicle moves forward (either directly forward or forward diagonally) 1d4 × 5 feet before coming to a complete stop. Having the Expert Driver feat (see page 100) reduces this distance by 10 feet (minimum 0 feet).</p><p><i>Keep It Going (move action):</i> With a successful driving check, the driver can move the vehicle forward on its current facing at its current speed, and it can move forward diagonally. Failing the check keeps the speed constant, but you cannot move the vehicle forward diagonally.</p><p><i>Reverse (standard action):</i> A vehicle may only be moved in reverse if it is at a full stop (movement of 0 feet). On a successful driving check, a vehicle can move backward at half its acceleration, moving either directly backward (the reverse of its forward facing) or backward diagonally. On a failed check, it does not move backward.</p><p><i>Turn (standard action):</i> The driver takes this action to turn a vehicle's forward facing 90 degrees. The vehicle moves its current speed. If a vehicle's current speed is twice its acceleration, the driving check DC increases by 5. If a vehicle's movement is three times its acceleration, the driving check DC increases by 10. If it is four or more times its acceleration, the DC increases by 20. With a successful driving check, the vehicle changes its facing either left or right by 90 degrees at any point during its movement. Do this by pivoting the vehicle so that the left rear or right rear side of the vehicle takes the place of the vehicle's former forward facing side. On a failed check, the vehicle does not turn, but can be moved forward diagonally during its movement.</p></text>\n            <img src=\"worlds/Fresh/Pathfinder%20Ultimate%20Combat/images/Turning%20a%20Vehicle.jpg\"/><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><i>Uncontrolled (no action):</i> When the driver does nothing or there is no driver, the vehicle is uncontrolled. An uncontrolled vehicle moves forward only (it cannot move forward diagonally). If a vehicle has muscle propulsion, it decelerates at a rate equal to its acceleration. If a vehicle is powered by an air current, water current, or some form of weird current, it slows by 10 feet. These decelerations are cumulative. If a vehicle does nothing, it cannot perform vehicular bull rushes, but can still perform a vehicular overrun or a ramming maneuver (see Vehicle Combat Maneuvers on page 177).</p><p><b>Driving a Vehicle Outside of Combat:</b> Since driving a vehicle outside of combat is easily accomplished by taking 10 on the skill check, driving checks are not normally needed. Almost every character can do it with relative ease; the DCs are given only to adjudicate special situations that may come up in your game.</p><p><b>Driving a Vehicle with Magic Propulsion:</b> Typically, a vehicle with magic propulsion requires actions but no driving checks in order to drive it. When driving a vehicle with magic propulsion, treat every action as though the driver succeeded at the driving check.</p><p><b>Driving a Vehicle without the Proper Skill:</b> If a driver lacks the proper skill to drive a vehicle, the driver can always make a Wisdom ability check instead of the appropriate skill check. The driver can even take 10 or gain the benefits of aid another when using Wisdom instead of the vehicle's normal driving skill.</p><p><b>Vehicle Crews:</b> Some vehicles require a crew. A vehicle with a full crew complement is as easy to control as any other vehicle. A vehicle without a full crew complement, but with at least half its crew, increases all driving check DCs by 10. A vehicle needs at least half its crew complement in order to be driven at all. Crew members can take no action while the vehicle is in motion except to aid in that vehicle's movement. A crew member does not threaten an area.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"dHWl7OvgcktMFxYg"}

This ability replaces their proficiency with the rapier and whip.</p><p><b>Battle Dance:</b> A dervish dancer is trained in the use of the Perform skill, especially dance, to create magical effects on himself. This works like bardic performance, except the dervish dancer only affects himself, and does not need to be able to see or hear his own performance. Battle dancing is treated as bardic performance for the purposes of feats, abilities, effects, and the like that affect bardic performance, except that battle dancing does not benefit from the Lingering Performance feat or any other ability that allows a bardic performance to grant bonuses after it has ended. Battle dancing benefits apply only when the bard is wearing light or no armor. Like bardic performance, it cannot be maintained at the same time as other performance abilities.</p><p>Starting a battle dance is a move action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. Changing a battle dance from one effect to another requires the dervish dancer to stop the previous performance and start the new one as a move action. Like a bard, a dervish dancer's performance ends immediately if he is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round. A dervish dancer cannot perform more than one battle dance at a time. At 10th level, a dervish dancer can start a battle dance as a swift action instead of a move action.</p><p>Dervish dancers gain the inspire courage, inspire greatness, and inspire heroics bardic performance types as battle dances, but these only provide benefit to the dervish dancer himself.</p><p><i>Rain of Blows (Su):</i> At 6th level, a dervish dancer can use his battle dance to speed up his attacks. When making a full attack action, he may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding, as though under the effects of a haste spell. He also gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and on Reflex saves. At 9th level, and every three bard levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by +1, to a maximum of +5 at 18th level. These bonuses do not stack with the haste spell. This ability replaces suggestion and mass suggestion.</p><p><i>Razor's Kiss (Su):</i> At 8th level, a dervish dancer can use his battle dance to improve his weapons' critical range. All attacks he makes with manufactured weapons are treated as though he had the Improved Critical feat. Natural weapons and spells are not affected. This ability replaces dirge of doom.</p><p><i>Leaf on the Wind (Su):</i> At 14th level, a dervish dancer can use his battle dance to evade attacks with unearthly grace and to shake off the effects of his wounds. Unlike other battle dances, leaf on the wind requires a standard action each round to start or maintain the performance. Each round it is maintained, including the first, the dervish dancer gains a +6 dodge bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves. If wounded, he heals 1 hit point of damage per bard level. This ability replaces frightening performance.</p><p><i>Fleet (Su):</i> While performing a battle dance, a dervish dancer gains a +10 enhancement bonus to his land speed. This bonus increases by 5 feet for every four bard levels gained after 1st level, to a maximum of +30 feet at 19th level. This ability replaces bardic knowledge and lore master.</p><p><b>Versatile Dance (Ex):</b> At 2nd level, a dervish dancer gains a bonus equal to half his level on Perform (dance) checks. He can use his bonus for his Perform (dance) skill in place of his bonus for Acrobatics. This ability replaces versatile performance.</p><p><b>Dance of Fury (Su):</b> At 12th level, a dervish dancer can attack more than once as he moves while performing a battle dance. He can combine a full-attack action with a single move, taking the attacks at any point during his movement, but must move at least 5 feet between each attack. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. This ability replaces soothing performance.</p><p><b>Battle Fury (Su):</b> At 20th level, the dervish dancer can unleash a whirlwind of blows while performing a battle dance. As a full-round action, he can take a single move action and unleash a single attack at his highest bonus against each target within his reach during any point of his move, up to a maximum number of attacks equal to the dervish dancer's character level. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, and replaces deadly performance.</p></text>\n            <img src=\"worlds/Fresh/Pathfinder%20Ultimate%20Combat/images/Dervish%20Dancer.jpg\"/>","_id":"dWYbPCU9XbgTmivB"}

To some, it is a means to an end, a regrettable necessity when all other options have failed, and a tool that is to be set down the moment it's not absolutely needed. To others, it is a panacea and a way of life-a means of solving any problem, and of proving one's worth by standing tall against one's fellows and the harsh denizens of an uncaring universe. In the hands of a skilled warrior, a sword is no longer simply a sharpened length of steel, and even a club is more than just a broken branch. These objects become instruments of a serious and sometimes brutal art, one whose practitioners are every bit as skilled in their artistry as the greatest bards. Many such acolytes of battle might say that theirs is the only art worth pursuing, as it's the sole one by which the artist not only inspires respect, but commands it. Combat is civilization's oldest trade and form of expression, and no matter how far we've come since the first days of stones and sticks, it continues to shape the events that define us. A civilized society may claim to abhor bloodshed, but it's that same bloodshed-or its threat-that watches over us and gives us the freedom to maintain such ideals.</p><p>While the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook presents a robust system capable of simulating most combat, as well as a wide selection of weapons and armor types common to most European-influenced fantasy settings, this chapter provides new options for GMs and players alike to add depth to the standard combat rules, as well as introduces a wealth of new weapons with historical ties to those lands that would have seemed strange and exotic to residents of Medieval Europe.</p><p>Major subjects and subsystems covered in this chapter include the following.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"eBPA907xcdJcdxzF"}

{"name":"Gunslinger Class Features","permission":{"default":0,"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_6fyp8xqfiwx","path":"Ultimate Combat Rulebook#/CF_SEP/CHAPTER 1: CLASSES#/CF_SEP/THE GUNSLINGER","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n        <text type=\"formattedtext\"><h1>CLASS FEATURES</h1><p>The following are class features of the gunslinger.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> Gunslingers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all firearms. They are proficient with all light armor.</p><p><b>Gunsmith:</b> At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.</p><p><b>Grit (Ex):</b> A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.</p><p><i>Critical Hit with a Firearm:</i> Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.</p><p><i>Killing Blow with a Firearm:</i> When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.</p><p><b>Deeds:</b> Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p><p><i>Deadeye (Ex):</i> At 1st level, the gunslinger can resolve an attack against touch AC instead of normal AC when firing beyond her firearm's first range increment. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point per range increment beyond the first. The gunslinger still takes the -2 penalty on attack rolls for each range increment beyond the first when she performs this deed.</p><p><i>Gunslinger's Dodge (Ex):</i> At 1st level, the gunslinger gains an uncanny knack for getting out of the way of ranged attacks. When a ranged attack is made against the gunslinger, she can spend 1 grit point to move 5 feet as an immediate action; doing so grants the gunslinger a +2 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. This movement is not a 5-foot step, and provokes attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, the gunslinger can drop prone to gain a +4 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. The gunslinger can only perform this deed while wearing medium or light armor, and while carrying no more than a light load.</p><p><i>Quick Clear (Ex):</i> At 1st level, as a standard action, the gunslinger can remove the broken condition from a single firearm she is currently wielding, as long as that condition was gained by a firearm misfire. The gunslinger must have at least 1 grit point to perform this deed. Alternatively, if the gunslinger spends 1 grit point to perform this deed, she can perform quick clear as a move-equivalent action instead of a standard action.</p><p><i>Gunslinger Initiative (Ex):</i> At 3rd level, as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she gains the following benefits. First, she gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. Furthermore, if she has the Quick Draw feat, her hands are free and unrestrained, and the firearm is not hidden, she can draw a single firearm as part of the initiative check.</p><p><i>Pistol-Whip (Ex):</i> At 3rd level, the gunslinger can make a surprise melee attack with the butt or handle of her firearm as a standard action. When she does, she is considered to be proficient with the firearm as a melee weapon and gains a bonus on the attack and damage rolls equal to the enhancement bonus of the firearm. The damage dealt by the pistol-whip is of the bludgeoning type, and is determined by the size of the firearm. One-handed firearms deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if wielded by Small creatures) and two-handed firearms deal 1d10 points of damage (1d8 if wielded by Small creatures). Regardless of the gunslinger's size, the critical multiplier of this attack is 20/×2. If the attack hits, the gunslinger can make a combat maneuver check to knock the target prone as a free action. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point.</p><p><i>Utility Shot (Ex):</i> At 3rd level, if the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she can perform all of the following utility shots. Each utility shot can be applied to any single attack with a firearm, but the gunslinger must declare the utility shot she is using before firing the shot.</p><list><li><i>Blast Lock:</i> The gunslinger makes an attack roll against a lock within the first range increment of her firearm. A Diminutive lock usually has AC 7, and larger locks have a lower AC. The lock gains a bonus to its AC against this attack based on its quality. A simple lock has a +10 bonus to AC, an average lock has a +15 bonus to AC, a good lock has a +20 bonus to AC, and a superior lock has a +30 bonus to AC. Arcane lock grants a +10 bonus to the AC of a lock against this attack. On a hit, the lock is destroyed, and the object can be opened as if it were unlocked. On a miss, the lock is destroyed, but the object is jammed and still considered locked. It can still be unlocked by successfully performing this deed, by using the Disable Device skill, or with the break DC, though the DC for either break or Disable Device or the AC increases by 10. A key, combination, or similar mechanical method of unlocking the lock no longer works, though knock can still be employed to bypass the lock, and the creator of an arcane lock can still bypass the wards of that spell.</li><li><i>Scoot Unattended Object:</i> The gunslinger makes an attack roll against a Tiny or smaller unattended object within the first range increment of her firearm. A Tiny unattended object has an AC of 5, a Diminutive unattended object has an AC of 7, and a Fine unattended object has an AC of 11. On a hit, the gunslinger does not damage the object with the shot, but can move it up to 15 feet farther away from the shot's origin. On a miss, she damages the object normally.</li><li><i>Stop Bleeding:</i> The gunslinger makes a firearm attack and then presses the hot barrel against herself or an adjacent creature to staunch a bleeding wound. Instead of dealing damage, the shot ends a single bleed condition affecting the creature. The gunslinger does not have to make an attack roll when performing the deed in this way; she can instead shoot the firearm into the air, but that shot still uses up ammunition normally.</li></list><p><i>Dead Shot (Ex):</i> At 7th level, as a full-round action, the gunslinger can take careful aim and pool all of her attack potential into a single, deadly shot. When she does this, she shoots the firearm at a single target, but makes as many attack rolls as she can, based on her base attack bonus. She makes the attack rolls in order from highest bonus to lowest, as if she were making a full attack. If any of the attack rolls hit the target, the gunslinger's single attack is considered to have hit. For each additional successful attack roll beyond the first, the gunslinger increases the damage of the shot by the base damage dice of the firearm. For instance, if a 7th-level gunslinger firing a musket hits with both attacks, she does 2d12 points of damage with the shot, instead of 1d12 points of damage, before adding any damage modifiers. Precision damage and extra damage from weapon special abilities (such as flaming) are added with damage modifiers and are not increased by this deed. If one or more rolls are critical threats, she confirms the critical once using her highest base attack bonus -5. For each critical threat beyond the first, she reduces this penalty by 1 (to a maximum of 0). The gunslinger only misfires on a dead shot if all the attack rolls are misfires. She cannot perform this deed with a blunderbuss or other scatter weapon when attacking creatures in a cone. The gunslinger must spend 1 grit point to perform this deed.</p><p><i>Startling Shot (Ex):</i> At 7th level, a gunslinger with least 1 grit point can spend a standard action to purposely miss a creature that she could normally hit with a firearm attack. When she does, that creature becomes flat-footed until the start of its next turn.</p><p><i>Targeting (Ex):</i> At 7th level, as a full-round action, the gunslinger can make a single firearm attack and choose part of the body to target. She gains the following effects depending on the part of the body targeted. If a creature does not have one of the listed body locations, that part cannot be targeted. This deed costs 1 grit point to perform no matter which part of the creature she targets. Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are immune to these effects.</p><list><li><i>Arms:</i> On a hit, the target takes no damage from the hit but drops one carried item of the gunslinger's choice, even if the item is wielded with two hands. Items held in a locked gauntlet are not dropped on a hit.</li><li><i>Head:</i> On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and is also confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect.</li><li><i>Legs:</i> On a hit, the target is damaged normally and knocked prone. Creatures that have four or more legs or that are immune to trip attacks are immune to this effect.</li><li><i>Torso:</i> Targeting the torso threatens a critical on a 19-20.</li><li><i>Wings:</i> On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and must make a DC 20 Fly check or fall 20 ft.</li></list><p><i>Bleeding Wound (Ex):</i> At 11th level, when the gunslinger hits a living creature with a firearm attack, she can spend 1 grit point as a free action to have that attack deal extra bleed damage. The amount of bleed damage is equal to the gunslinger's Dexterity modifier. Alternatively, the gunslinger can spend 2 grit points to deal 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution bleed damage (gunslinger's choice) instead. Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to these types of bleed damage.</p><p><i>Expert Loading (Ex):</i> At 11th level, whenever the gunslinger rolls a misfire with a gun that has the broken condition, she can spend 1 grit point to keep the gun from exploding, though it retains the broken condition.</p><p><i>Lightning Reload (Ex):</i> At 11th level, as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she can reload a single barrel of a one-handed or two-handed firearm as a swift action once per round. If she has the Rapid Reload feat or is using an alchemical cartridge (or both), she can reload a single barrel of the weapon as a free action each round instead. Furthermore, using this deed does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p><p><i>Evasive (Ex):</i> At 15th level, when the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she gains the benefit of the evasion, uncanny dodge, and improved uncanny dodge rogue class features. She uses her gunslinger level as her rogue level for improved uncanny dodge.</p><p><i>Menacing Shot (Ex):</i> At 15th level, the gunslinger can spend 1 grit point, shoot a firearm into the air, and affect all living creatures within a 30-foot-radius burst as if they were subject to the fear spell. The DC of this effect is equal to 10 + 1/2 the gunslinger's level + the gunslinger's Wisdom modifier.</p><p><i>Slinger's Luck (Ex):</i> At 15th level, the gunslinger can spend grit to reroll a saving throw or a skill check. It costs 2 grit points to reroll a saving throw, and 1 grit point to reroll a skill check. The gunslinger must take the result of the second roll, even if it is lower. The deed's cost cannot be reduced by the true grit class ability, the Signature Deed feat, or any other effect that reduces the amount of grit a deed costs.</p><p><i>Cheat Death (Ex):</i> At 19th level, whenever the gunslinger is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, she can spend all of her remaining grit points (minimum 1) to instead be reduced to 1 hit point.</p><p><i>Death's Shot (Ex):</i> At 19th level, when the gunslinger scores a critical hit, she can spend 1 grit point to deal normal damage, and the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the gunslinger's level + the gunslinger's Dexterity modifier. On a failed saving throw, the target dies. This is a death attack. Performing this deed does not allow the gunslinger to regain grit from confirming a critical hit or making a killing blow.</p><p><i>Stunning Shot (Ex):</i> At 19th level, when a gunslinger hits a creature, she can spend 2 grit points to stun the creature for 1 round. The creature must make a Fortitude saving throw (the DC = 10 + 1/2 the gunslinger's level + the gunslinger's Wisdom modifier). If the creature fails, it is stunned for 1 round. Creatures that are immune to critical hits are also immune to this effect.</p><p><b>Nimble (Ex):</b> Starting at 2nd level, a gunslinger gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes the gunslinger to lose her Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the gunslinger to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).</p><p><b>Bonus Feats:</b> At 4th level, and every four levels thereafter, a gunslinger gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained by normal advancement. These bonus feats must be combat or grit feats.</p><p><b>Gun Training (Ex):</b> Starting at 5th level, a gunslinger can select one specific type of firearm (such as an axe musket, blunderbuss, musket, or pistol). She gains a bonus equal to her Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing that type of firearm. Furthermore, when she misfires with that type of firearm, the misfire value of that firearm increases by 2 instead of 4.</p><p>Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the gunslinger picks up another type of firearm, gaining these bonuses for those types as well.</p><p><b>True Grit (Ex):</b> At 20th level, a gunslinger picks two deeds that she has access to and that she must spend grit to perform. She can perform these deeds for 1 grit point fewer (minimum 0) than usual. If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point. If a deed could already be performed as long as she had at least 1 grit point, she can now perform that deed even when she has no grit points.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"fc9NJmxfu7Jy8LsI"}

The Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide introduces several more combat-oriented base classes, such as the cavalier, whose dedication to an order helps make him a natural leader and champion on the battlefield, and the inquisitor, who will stop at nothing to bring her chosen foes to justice (or deliver it herself at the point of a sword). Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic brings players and GMs the magus, a classic blend of peerless martial combatant and weapon-focused arcane magic. Last but not least, this book introduces three brand-new character options: the gunslinger base class, the samurai and ninja alternate classes, and a host of new archetypes for the various combat-oriented classes.</p><p>That's a lot of options, and some rather complex terminology, so let's break it down.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"fg3THvYko71fI7A0"}

Using such an ability on a called shot turns it into a normal attack, with none of the benefits or penalties associated with called shots. From a story perspective, this is because the effect cannot distinguish between a hit in general and a hit in a particular area, but it's also necessary to keep the power of such abilities in line with their original intended effects. Some Game Masters may prefer a more theatrical or dangerous game in which magic can make a shot through the eye nearly certain, in which case this rule can be ignored.</p><p><b>Cover:</b> Cover other than soft cover interferes with a called shot even more than with a normal shot. Double any AC bonuses provided by cover that isn't soft cover. In addition, cover may make certain called shots impossible.</p><p><b>Concealment:</b> The miss chance for a called shot against a creature with concealment increases to 50%. It's not possible to make a called shot against a creature with total concealment. For effects that function like concealment, such as blink and displacement, a miss chance of 50% or more prevents called shots, a miss chance of 20% increases to 50%, and miss chances of other values are doubled.</p><p><b>Damage Reduction:</b> If damage reduction completely negates the damage from a called shot, the called shot has no effect. If hit point damage does get through, the called shot has normal effects. Damage reduction does not reduce any ability damage, ability drain, penalties, or bleed damage caused by the called shot.</p><p><b>Immunity:</b> Immunity to critical hits protects against the extra effects of called shots. Partial protection, such as that provided by the fortification special ability of some magical armors, protects the creature as though the called shot were a critical hit.</p><p><b>Regeneration:</b> Regeneration provides no special protection against called shots, but it might negate or undo some of the effects, such as bleeding or limb loss.</p><p><b>Saving Throws:</b> If a saving throw is allowed on a called shot, the DC is equal to the Armor Class hit by the attack. In the case of an attack roll of a natural 20, the DC is the AC the attack would have hit if 20s did not automatically hit.</p><p><b>Stacking:</b> Unless otherwise stated, penalties for multiple called shots do not stack, even if they are to different areas of the body. Ability damage and drain caused by called shots always stacks.</p><p><b>Touch Attacks:</b> Touch attacks and ranged touch attacks made as called shots must target AC rather than touch AC. This represents the care it takes to target such strikes.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"iL5fqbfAdKOZL8sp"}

These honor guards are sometimes merely ornamental, performing their functions on a ceremonial basis, but a surprising number are capable, deadly opponents, able to take down a threat long before their liege knows of the danger. To be an honor guard is to constantly place one's self in harm's way, and to always be willing to lay down one's life at a moment's notice.</p><p><b>Sworn Defense (Ex):</b> At 1st level, whenever an honor guard issues a challenge, he can select one ally as his ward for the duration of the challenge. Whenever the honor guard is adjacent to his ward, he takes a -1 penalty to Armor Class, and the ward receives a +1 dodge bonus to AC. This modifies the challenge ability</p><p><b>Intercept (Ex):</b> At 3rd level, an honor guard learns to better disrupt the attacks of his enemies. He gains Bodyguard (Advanced Player's Guide 151) as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisite. In addition, whenever the honor guard uses the aid another action to increase an ally's Armor Class, the bonus to Armor Class granted by the aid another action increases by +1. This ability replaces cavalier's charge.</p><p><b>Warding Charge (Ex):</b> At 11th level, an honor guard can flash across the battlefield to protect his ward against the target of his challenge. Whenever the target of the honor guard's challenge makes an attack against his ward, the honor guard can move up to his speed and make a single melee attack against the target of his challenge as an immediate action. This movement and attack can be made as a charge if the movement qualifies. This ability replaces mighty charge.</p><p><b>Defensive Challenge (Ex):</b> At 12th level, whenever an honor guard declares a challenge, his target must pay particular attention to him and his ability to intercept attacks. As long as the target is within the threatened area of the cavalier, it takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls against anyone other than the honor guard.

GM and player opinions run the gamut from staunch traditionalists who refuse to wield any weapon more complex than a crossbow to gaming groups who believe that the best way to stop a raging orc chieftain is to unload all six cylinders of your trusty revolver into his gray-green hide.</p><p>Neither side is wrong. Firearms are best introduced carefully, but are by no means game-breaking on their own. Neither are they necessarily anachronistic-much of scientific discovery is based on chance, and nothing says that breakthroughs in your fantasy world have to occur at the same historical points as they did on Earth, or even that they need to occur simultaneously across your world. On Earth, the Chinese had fully functional cannons, flamethrowers, and land mines before Europeans had even discovered gunpowder. It's entirely possible to have guns exist alongside bows and swords in neighboring countries, or even within the same one. Depending on the rate of fire of your firearm, there are undoubtedly many situations in which a warrior armed with a simpler weapon would win the day.</p><p>The firearms section presented in this chapter covers everything you need to know to introduce firearms into your campaign. Firearms are broken down into early and advanced types, as well as into one- and two-handed weapons. There are scatter guns like shotguns that fire spreads of pellets, straightforward slug-throwers that fire a single bullet, and some weapons that can do both. Included as well are rules for misfires and repairs, reloading and ammunition, concealed or inappropriately sized weapons, magical weapon special abilities and ammunition specifically for firearms, and more. Perhaps most importantly, there's a discussion of the various levels of gun technology and its emergence into society, with suggestions for which weapons are appropriate for each level.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"j6KZvsrPhUQWEQDZ"}

Unlike the alchemist, at 1st level, the arcane bomber chooses one type of energy from the following list: acid, cold, fire, and electricity. He can throw bombs of that type, but cannot modify them with discoveries. This ability stacks with the alchemist bomb ability to determine the level of bomb damage, but an arcane bomber that becomes an alchemist does not gain that class's bomb ability, nor does an alchemist that becomes an arcane bomber gain this bomb ability. This ability replaces arcane bond.</p><p><b>Spellblast Bombs (Su):</b> At 1st level, as a swift action, an arcane bomber can sacrifice one of his spells to empower the next bomb he throws during his turn. When he does, he gains a bonus to hit with the next bomb he throws before the end of his turn equal to the level of the spell he sacrificed, and a bonus to damage equal to twice the level of the spell.

An arcane bomber who prepares spells from his opposition school must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell. In addition, the arcane bomber takes a -4 penalty on any skill checks made when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of his opposition schools.

When casting the spell, the caster picks a one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, sonic, or force. The ammunition within the siege weapon now deals that type of energy damage on a hit, though the amount of damage dealt by the ammunition does not change, nor does it change any of the other effects of the ammunition. Unlike other forms of energy damage, this energy damage does full damage to objects. Based on the type of energy the caster chose while casting, the ammunition also gains one of the following effects.</p><p><i>Acid:</i> The ammunition deals half its damage in a splash to all creatures and unattended objects within 15 feet of the target hit by the siege engine. Creatures can halve the splash damage with a Reflex saving throw. The DC of the splash is the same as the DC of the spell.</p><p><i>Cold:</i> The ammunition creates an ice sheen within a 20-foot-radius burst around the target of the siege engine's attack. That sheen lasts 1d6 rounds. Creatures within the ice sheen are entangled. Any creature within the area of the ice sheen at the start of its turn takes 2d6 cold damage.</p><p><i>Electricity:</i> Creatures hit by the siege engine attack or within 15 feet of the attack are staggered for 1 round.</p><p><i>Fire:</i> Creatures and wood objects within 15 feet of the attack may catch on fire (Core Rulebook 444 and page 164 of this book).</p><p><i>Sonic:</i> Creatures hit by the attack or within 20 feet of the attack must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be deafened for one hour.

With years of field testing and design work, the system is intended to be as robust and all-encompassing as possible, with the additional rules subsystems presented in Chapter 3: Mastering Combat helping adjudicate some corner cases and add to the fun in specific types of games.</p><p>Some players and Game Masters, however, may wish to replace whole sections of the traditional Pathfinder RPG combat system with something new-either as a change of pace, or out of an attempt to better simulate the actual blow-by-blow action of physical combat. Presented in this chapter are several optional rules variants for combat that may be swapped out with the existing rules. As these options significantly revise how the game works, players and GMs should be extremely careful when deciding whether or not to incorporate these optional rules into an existing campaign, and should be prepared for an additional layer of complexity and potential slowdowns in gameplay as everyone at the table works on getting up to speed.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"mn3h4OSREuJjjIpj"}

Some believe that one should not kick enemies when they are down, or should limit use of other such dirty tricks to the most dire of circumstances. The cad places no such limitations on himself. Battles are for winning, and anything that gives the cad the upper hand against his enemies is a legitimate tactic. No trick is too treacherous if it leads to victory.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> A cad is not proficient with medium armor, heavy armor, or tower shields.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Sleight of Hand (Dex), and Stealth (Dex) are class skills for a cad.</p><p><b>Dirty Maneuvers (Ex):</b> At 2nd level, a cad becomes skilled at deceiving and discomfiting his opponents. The cad gains a +1 bonus on disarm, dirty trick, and steal combat maneuver checks. The cad also gains a +1 bonus to CMD when attacked with the disarm, dirty trick, and steal combat maneuvers. These bonuses increase by 1 for every four levels after 2nd (to a maximum of +5 at 18th level). This ability replaces bravery.</p><p><b>Catch Off-Guard:</b> At 3rd level, the cad gains the Catch Off-Guard feat. This ability replaces armor training 1.</p><p><b>Payback (Ex):</b> At 5th level, a cad gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against any creature that has attacked the cad since the beginning of his last turn. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 5th (to a maximum of +4 at 17th level). This ability replaces weapon training 1, 3, and 4.</p><p><b>Deadly Surprise (Ex):</b> At 7th level, when a cad hits an opponent that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against him with a weapon or unarmed attack, he may attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver as an immediate action as part of the attack. This ability replaces armor training 2.</p><p><b>Razor-Sharp Chair Leg (Ex):</b> At 9th level, as a swift action, a cad may alter the type of damage dealt by an improvised weapon to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. In addition, the cad has a critical threat range of 19-20/×2 with any improvised melee weapon. This ability replaces weapon training 2.</p><p><b>Craven Combatant (Ex):</b> At 11th level, when fighting defensively or using Combat Expertise or total defense, a cad cannot be flanked except by a rogue or ninja whose level is four or more higher than the cad's fighter level. This ability replaces armor training 3.</p><p><b>Sweeping Prank (Ex):</b> At 13th level, as a standard action, a cad can use a dirty trick maneuver against any two adjacent opponents that he can reach, making a separate combat maneuver check against each opponent. He must use the same dirty trick maneuver against each opponent.</p><p>At 17th level, the cad can use this ability as a full-round action to attempt a dirty trick maneuver against a number of enemies equal to 2 + his Dexterity bonus (if any). This ability replaces weapon training 3 and 4.</p><p><b>Treacherous Blow (Ex):</b> At 15th level, when a cad confirms a critical hit, he can attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver as part of that attack as an immediate action. This ability replaces armor training 4.</p><p><b>Ultimate Payback (Ex):</b> At 20th level, any critical threats a cad makes against an opponent that has attacked him since the beginning of his last turn are automatically confirmed.

An armor piece is a small group of armor parts, rather than simply being any discrete part of the armor. A single armor piece comprises the armor parts one needs to protect its corresponding area-either the arms, the legs, or the torso (including the head); a single arm or leg armor piece provides armor for both arms or both legs, respectively. A plate arm armor piece typically consists of pairs of pauldrons, gardbraces, rerebraces, vambraces, and gauntlets along with bits of chainmail and padded armor, while a chain lamellar arm armor piece consists of two chain sleeves, gauntlets, and perhaps pairs of pauldrons and couters. Both protect the arms, though they have a different number of specific parts and types of overall components.</p><p>The protective qualities of each individual piece of armor are listed in Table 5-7: Arm Armor Pieces, Table 5-8: Leg Armor Pieces, and Table 5-9: Torso Armor Pieces. If a character has only one armor piece, that piece is considered the totality of her armor, and she uses the statistics of that piece as her armor. If a character is wearing more than one armor piece, she add the armor costs, armor bonuses, and weights of the armor pieces, and takes the worst maximum Dexterity bonus, arcane spell failure chance, and speed limitations from among the various armor pieces to determine the full statistics and qualities of the armor she is wearing. As long as she is wearing a single armor piece, she is considered to be wearing armor for any effects that rely on wearing armor (such as the fighter class's armor training and armor mastery).</p><p>If a character is wearing all three categories of armor pieces, she is wearing a suit of armor. Suits of armor can have all armor pieces of the same type (all three plate pieces make a suit of full plate), or a mixture of armor pieces (a plate arm armor piece and torso armor piece combined with a chainmail leg armor piece creates a suit of half-plate). Wearing an entire suit, whether its pieces are mixed or the same type, grants a +1 armor bonus on top of the protection the combination of pieces already grants the wearer. Wearing a mixed suit of armor increases the arcane spell failure chance by 5% because of the awkwardness of the design. Wearing less than a full suit of mixed armor does not increase the wearer's arcane spell failure chance.</p><p>For example, if you wear a breastplate with a plate arm armor piece and a chain leg armor piece, you should consult Table 5-5: Half-Plate Suit Pieces for your armor's statistics. The top line lists the cost, bonuses, penalties, and so on for the half-plate suit as a whole, and the lines below list the statistics for the component pieces, as well as the benefits that result from the pieces constituting a suit.</p><h1>TABLE 5-5: HALF-PLATE SUIT PIECES</h1><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b></b></td><td><b></b></td><td><b></b></td><td><b></b></td><td><b></b></td><td><b></b></td><td colspan=\"2\"><b>Speed</b></td></tr><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Armor Type</b></td><td><b>Cost</b></td><td><b>Armor Bonus</b></td><td><b>Max Dex Bonus</b></td><td><b>AC Penalty</b></td><td><b>Arcane Spell Failure</b></td><td><b>30 ft.</b></td><td><b>20 ft.</b></td><td><b>Weight</b></td></tr><tr><td>Half-plate</td><td>600 gp</td><td>+8</td><td>+0</td><td>-7</td><td>40%</td><td>20 ft.</td><td>15 ft.</td><td>50 lbs.</td></tr><tr><td>(plate arm armor piece)</td><td>375 gp</td><td>+1</td><td>+0</td><td>-7</td><td>35%</td><td>30 ft. </td><td>20 ft. </td><td>10 lbs.</td></tr><tr><td>(chain leg armor piece)</td><td>25 gp</td><td>+0</td><td>+2</td><td>-2</td><td>15%</td><td>30 ft. </td><td>20 ft. </td><td>10 lbs.</td></tr><tr><td>(plate torso armor piece)</td><td>200 gp</td><td>+6</td><td>+3</td><td>-4</td><td>35%</td><td>20 ft.</td><td>15 ft.</td><td>30 lbs.</td></tr><tr><td>(suit)</td><td>-</td><td>+1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>+5%</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr></table></text>\n            ","_id":"p2uYUVukT5rquzaD"}

The DR an armor provides is equal to its total armor bonus with a +1 bonus at 5th level or at 5 Hit Dice, with an increase to that bonus of +1 for every five levels above 5th level, or every 5 Hit Dice over 5 Hit Dice (to a maximum of +4 to DR at 20th level or at 20 or more Hit Dice), provided that the creature wearing the armor is also proficient with the armor.</p><p><b>Using Armor without Proficiency:</b> Creatures using armor they are not proficient with do not gain the bonus per level or Hit Dice to the DR, on top of any of the other normal penalties for using armor without proficiency.</p><p><b>DR/Armor:</b> This type of DR blocks the damage of all attacks that would normally be affected by DR, based on the composition of the armor (see Table 5-1). Unlike most forms of damage reduction, DR/armor stacks with other types of DR. For instances, when fighting a skeleton with DR 5/bludgeoning and DR 4/armor (+2 for armor, +2 for natural armor), the skeleton's DR/armor reduces 9 points of damage from non-bludgeoning attacks, and 4 damage from bludgeoning weapon attacks. Magic weapons and attacks from Large or larger creatures bypass the DR 4/armor, but not the DR 5/bludgeoning.</p><p><b>Natural Armor Bonus and DR:</b> Like a creature's armor bonus, a natural armor bonus is also converted into damage reduction. If a creature is wearing armor and has a natural armor bonus, the creature adds its armor bonus to its natural armor bonus to determine the amount of DR/armor that it has (see Table 5-2).</p><p>For instance, if a creature wearing a +2 chain shirt has DR 6/armor is then subject to a barkskin spell cast by a 6th-level druid (gaining a +3 natural armor bonus), its DR becomes DR 9/armor for the duration of the spell. This DR is bypassed by adamantine, or the attacks of Huge or larger creatures.</p><p>A creature that has both DR from a source other than armor and a natural armor bonus gains the effects of an enhanced form of DR, similar to how the composition of the armor grants special DR/armor defenses (see Table 5-1). If a creature has magical armor, natural armor, and DR, it takes the best form of the special protection provided by both its armor and its mix of DR and natural armor to its DR/armor.</p><p>For instance, if a creature has natural armor and DR/magic and is wearing adamantine armor, that creature's DR/armor functions as DR/-, and can be bypassed by Gargantuan or larger creatures, since the adamantine armor provides the best of the two damage reductions.</p><p><b>Unusual Creatures and Armor DR:</b> Amorphous or incorporeal creatures have an easier time bypassing DR/armor. When they attack a creature with DR/armor, they typically treat that DR as a fraction of the DR/armor. Attacks by incorporeal creatures entirely ignore the DR unless that DR comes from a force effect or from armor with the ghost touch special armor quality. These traits are detailed in Table 5-3.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"pJVTqLbHmsMiscxv"}

The base DC of the performance combat check is determined by the current attitude of the crowd toward the side of combat.</p><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Starting or\tCurrent Attitude</b></td><td><b>Base DC to Improve Attitude</b></td></tr><tr><td>Hostile</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Hostile</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Unfriendly</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Indifferent</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Friendly</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Helpful </td><td>20 [1]</td></tr></table><p>[1] This is the DC to gain a victory point.</p><p>The base DC is modified by the size of the crowd, the number of participants on each side, and a number of other circumstances.</p><p><b>Size of the Crowd:</b> Larger crowds are harder to sway to one side or the other. It takes great shows of daring or a progression of numerous displays of crowd-pleasing actions to get them to change their attitude. Presented here are the general crowd sizes and their effects on the DC to improve crowd attitudes and gain victory points.</p><p><i>Small Crowd:</i> A small crowd contains no fewer than two and no more than 25 creatures. It does not increase the base DC of all performance combat checks.</p><p><i>Medium Crowd:</i> A medium crowd contains no fewer than 26 and no more than 100 creatures. A medium crowd increases the DC of all performance combat checks by +2.</p><p><i>Large Crowd:</i> A large crowd contains no fewer than 101 and no more than 300 creatures. A large crowd increases the DC of all performance combat checks by +3.</p><p><i>Massive Mob:</i> A massive mob is made up of no fewer than 301 creatures, and its numbers can expand into the thousands. A massive mob increases the DC of all performance combat checks by +4.</p><p><b>Total Number of Combatants:</b> The participation of a large number of combatants increases the difficulty of swaying the crowd. Large groups of combatants make it difficult for a crowd to follow the entire battle and to catch actions from individuals that could possibly sway the audience's attitude. Adjust these modifications as combatants enter or leave the battle.</p><p><i>Small Battle:</i> If the battle is between a total of 2-8 combatants, there is no change to the base DC to improve the attitude of the crowd or gain victory points.</p><p><i>Medium Battle:</i> If the battle is between 9-16 combatants, the DC to improve the attitude of the crowd or gain victory points increases by +4.</p><p><i>Large Battle:</i> A battle with 17 or more total combatants increases the DC to improve the attitude of the crowd by +8.</p><p><b>Other Circumstances That Affect DC:</b> Other circumstances that always affect the DC to improve the attitude of the crowd or gain victory points include the following.</p><p><i>Cheating:</i> If one side visibly cheats or breaks the rules, the DC for that side of the performance combat to improve the attitude of the crowd increases by 2 for the remainder of the performance combat. This increase can occur multiple times in a battle. For the purpose of spotting cheating, determine the base Perception and Sense Motive for the average member of a crowd (usually +0 if you assume an average human) and apply the following modifiers based on crowd size. The DC is based on whatever action the combatant is using to hide any cheating (usually Bluff or Stealth).</p><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Crowd Size</b></td><td><b>Bonus on Perception and Sense Motive Checks to Spot Cheating</b></td></tr><tr><td>Small crowd</td><td>+8</td></tr><tr><td>Medium crowd</td><td>+12</td></tr><tr><td>Large crowd</td><td>+16</td></tr><tr><td>Massive mob</td><td>+20</td></tr></table><p><i>Outnumbered:</i> If one side of the battle outnumbers the others by less than a 2:1 ratio, the DC for that side to improve the attitude of the crowd or to gain victory points increases by 2. If one side outnumbers all others by a ratio of 2:1 or more, the DC for that side to improve the attitude of the crowd increases by 6. These increases to the DC end or are reduced to the appropriate level if the numbers become even or if the 2:1 ratio of combatants is ever brought down to outnumbering the other sides by less than a 2:1 ratio.</p><p><i>Unfair Advantage:</i> If one side of the battle has an obvious unfair advantage (for example, one side starts the battle in a fortified position or has better weapons and armor, or its opponents are not armed at all), the DC to improve the attitude of the crowd is increased by 2. A GM can increase the DC by as much as 6 if the unfair advantage is severe enough.</p><p><i>Bribery or Coercion:</i> Crowds can be bribed or coerced. Typically a successful bribe or attempt at coercion involves paying some amount of gold based on the crowd size, and succeeding at a Diplomacy check with a DC based on the size of the crowd. If the gold is paid and the Diplomacy check fails, the side gains a penalty for cheating instead, though the gold is still spent. If the check succeeds, the DC to improve crowd reaction and gain victory points decreases by 2. For every 5 points over the DC by which the combatants make the check, the DC to improve the crowd's attitude or to gain a victory point decreases by 1.</p><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Crowd Size</b></td><td><b>Diplomacy DC</b></td><td><b>Gold Paid</b></td></tr><tr><td>Small crowd</td><td>DC 15</td><td>25 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Medium crowd</td><td>DC 20</td><td>250 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Large crowd</td><td>DC 25</td><td>750 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Massive mob </td><td>DC 30</td><td>2,000 gp</td></tr></table></text>\n            ","_id":"phXQWBlKGlmUJYOK"}

Skilled warriors and adept diplomats, these cavaliers counsel wisdom, patience, and understanding, but are ever mindful of the need to take up arms to strike down aggressors, tyrants, or evil usurpers. Although they believe wholeheartedly in peace as an aim and a final goal, cavaliers of the blue rose are warriors first, and embrace their role as guardians of those who cannot or will not take up arms to defend themselves.</p><p><b>Edicts:</b> The cavalier must guard against needless violence, protecting both the land and its people from wars they neither started nor wish to fight. He must seek to stop conflict with a minimum of bloodshed, to encourage peaceful resolutions to disagreements between intelligent creatures, and to mend the wounds opened by battle. He must also honor quarter when he gives it, protecting captives who have surrendered from his own allies if need be.</p><p><b>Challenge:</b> Whenever an order of the blue rose cavalier issues a challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made against the target of his challenge, if the target is an intelligent creature to whom the cavalier offered the chance to surrender (by taking a standard action to offer terms). This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the cavalier possesses (to a maximum of +5 at 17th level).</p><p><b>Skills:</b> An order of the blue rose cavalier adds Knowledge (history) (Int) and Knowledge (nobility) (Int) to his list of class skills. Whenever an order of the blue rose cavalier uses Diplomacy to try to mediate a dispute between two parties that do not include him, he receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1).</p><p><b>Order Abilities:</b> A cavalier belonging to the order of the blue rose gains the following abilities as he increases in level.</p><p><i>Flat of the Blade (Ex):</i> At 2nd level, the cavalier of the order of the blue rose gains the ability to moderate his attacks in order to take an enemy alive. He no longer takes a -4 penalty when attacking with a lethal weapon to deal nonlethal damage. When dealing nonlethal damage, the cavalier receives a +2 bonus on damage rolls. When the cavalier makes use of this ability, he must attempt to subdue his target without killing it; dealing lethal damage after using this ability, or allowing his allies to kill the target, is considered a violation of his edicts.</p><p><i>Inner Peace (Ex):</i> At 8th level, the cavalier has learned that while not all things in the world will go as he wishes, he must remain calm and centered. Once per day as an immediate action, the cavalier may ignore an amount of damage from a single source (one attack, spell, or effect) equal to his cavalier level plus his Charisma modifier. He can only ignore hit point damage in this fashion. The cavalier can use this ability one additional time per day at 12th level and every four levels thereafter (to a maximum of four times per day at 20th level).</p><p><i>Shield of Blades (Ex):</i> At 15th level, the cavalier gains an expert sense of impending violence around him. When taking the total defense action, the cavalier can extend his protection to those around him, granting a +2 circumstance bonus to AC to all adjacent allies. In addition, while taking the total defense action, as an immediate action, the cavalier can attempt to deflect an attack by making an attack roll opposed by the attacker's original attack roll. If successful, the attack is deflected and deals no damage.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"r9LEY7eN5nQmmJVo"}

While rogues lack the pure martial power of some classes, they make up for it with sly tactics, employing tricks and poisons, and of course, flanking opponents and unleashing their devastating sneak attacks whenever possible. The archetypes and new rogue talents presented here represent slightly more aggressive rogues, including many whose skill sets are geared toward combat and supporting their comrades in combat situations. Many of these new talents and archetypes rely less on subtlety and subterfuge and more on direct actions.</p><p>Rogue talents and advanced rogue talents marked with an asterisk (*) in the archetype sections appear for the first time in this book. Rogue talents and advanced rogue talents marked with two asterisks (**) in the archetype sections can be found in the Advanced Player's Guide.</p><p><b>Rogue Talents:</b> Any rogue who meets the prerequisites can take any of the following new rogue talents. A rogue cannot take a talent more than once, unless the talent states otherwise. Talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to a rogue's sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision must be made before the roll is made.</p><p><i>Black Market Connections (Ex):</i> A rogue with this talent gains better access to magic items from black market connections. She treats every settlement as one size greater (see Table 15-1 on page 461 of the Core Rulebook) for the purpose of determining the gp limit of the base value of items for sale, as well as the number of minor, medium, and major magic items for sale in the settlement. If the settlement is already a metropolis, all minor and medium magic items are for sale, as well as 3d8 major magic items. With a successful Diplomacy check, the rogue can treat the settlement as two sizes larger. If the settlement is already a metropolis and she succeeds at the check, all magic items are for sale. If the settlement is already a large city and she succeeds at the check, all minor and medium magic items are for sale, as well as 3d8 major magic items. With a successful check, the rogue can also sell stolen items on the black market. If the check fails by 5 or more, the rogue does something to spook the market, and treats the city as normal for 1 week. Furthermore, those in control of the black market may alert the authorities to the rogue's presence in an act of reprisal for spooking the market or to divert attention away from their illicit activities. The DCs of the checks are by settlement size and are given in the table below.</p><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Community Size</b></td><td><b>DC</b></td></tr><tr><td>Thorp</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Hamlet</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Village</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Small town</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Large town</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Small city</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Large city</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Metropolis</td><td>35</td></tr></table><p><i>Convincing Lie (Ex):</i> When a rogue with this talent lies, she creates fabrications so convincing that others treat them as truth. When a rogue with this talent successfully uses the Bluff skill to convince someone that what she is saying is true, if that individual is questioned later about the statement or story, that person uses the rogue's Bluff skill modifier to convince the questioner, rather than his own. If his Bluff skill modifier is better than the rogue's, the individual can use his own modifier and gain a +2 bonus on any check to convince others of the lie. This effect lasts for a number of days equal to 1/2 the rogue's level + the rogue's Charisma modifier.</p><p><i>Deft Palm (Ex):</i> A rogue with this talent can make a Sleight of Hand check to conceal a weapon while holding it in plain sight, even while she is being observed.</p><p><i>Esoteric Scholar (Ex):</i> Once a day, a rogue with this talent may attempt a Knowledge check, even when she is not trained in that Knowledge skill.</p><p><i>Firearm Training (Ex):</i> A rogue with this talent gains Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearms).</p><p><i>Getaway Artist (Ex):</i> A rogue with this talent adds Fly, Handle Animal, and Ride to her list of class skills, and gains a +2 bonus on all driving checks.</p><p><i>Grit (Ex):</i> A rogue with this talent gains the Amateur Gunslinger feat and one grit feat of her choice. She must fulfill the prerequisites of the grit feat in order to choose it. A rogue must have the firearm training talent before choosing this one.</p><p><i>Hold Breath (Ex):</i> A rogue with this talent increases the number of rounds she can hold her breath by 2. She can take this talent multiple times.</p><p><i>Iron Guts (Ex):</i> A rogue with this talent has a cast-iron stomach or has trained herself to withstand poisons, especially ingested ones. She gains a +1 bonus on all saves against ingested poisons as well as a +4 bonus on saves against all spells and effects that cause the rogue to be nauseated or sickened.</p><p><i>Ki Pool (Ex):</i> A rogue with this talent gains a small ki pool. This ki pool is similar to a ninja's ki pool, but the rogue's ki pool does not grant any extra attacks. The rogue gains a number of ki points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). These ki points replenish at the start of each day. If she already has a ki pool, or gains a ki pool later, she gains half her Wisdom bonus (minimum 1) as bonus ki points to her ki pool. She can spend a ki point to gain a +10-foot bonus to movement until the end of her turn.</p><p><i>Ninja Trick (Ex):</i> A rogue with this talent can choose a trick from the ninja trick list (see pages 14-16). The rogue can choose but cannot use talents that require ki points, unless she has a ki pool. A rogue can pick this talent more than once.</p><p><i>Rope Master (Ex):</i> A rogue with this ability can move at her normal speed when using rope on a Climb check, can take 10 when using Acrobatics to move over narrow surfaces even when in danger or distracted, and gains a +4 bonus when determining the DC to escape bonds when she ties up a creature.</p><p><i>Strong Stroke (Ex):</i> A rogue with this talent rolls twice when making Swim checks and takes the better result. If she already rolls twice while making a Swim check because of another ability or effect, she gains a +2 insight bonus on both of those rolls instead. If the rogue is under the effect of a spell or ability that forces her to roll two dice and take the worse result, she only needs to roll 1d20 while making Swim checks.</p><p><i>Terrain Mastery (Ex):</i> A rogue with this talent gains a favored terrain as the ranger ability of the same name, though the favored terrain ability does not increase with her level as the ranger's ability does. A rogue can take this ability multiple times, each time applying it to a new terrain, and granting all other favored terrains a +2 increase to the favored terrain bonus.</p><p><i>Underhanded* (Ex):</i> A rogue with this talent gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal a weapon. Furthermore, if she makes a sneak attack during the surprise round using a concealed weapon that her opponent didn't know about, she does not have to roll sneak attack damage, and the sneak attack deals maximum damage. A rogue can only use the underhanded talent a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 0).</p><p><i>Wall Scramble (Ex):</i> A rogue with this talent rolls twice when making Climb checks and takes the better of the two rolls. If she already rolls twice while making a Climb check because of another ability or effect, she gains a +2 insight bonus on both of those rolls instead. If the rogue is under the effect of a spell or ability that forces her to roll two dice and take the worse result, she only needs to roll 1d20 while making Climb checks.</p><p><b>Advanced Rogue Talents:</b> The following new advanced rogue talents can be selected by any rogue of 10th level or higher who meets the prerequisites.</p><p><i>Confounding Blades* (Ex):</i> When a rogue with this talent hits a creature with a melee weapon that deals sneak attack damage, her target cannot make attacks of opportunity until the beginning of her next turn.</p><p><i>Familiar (Ex):</i> A rogue with this talent gains a familiar as the familiar option of the wizard's arcane bond class feature. This ability functions exactly like that part of the class feature, but the rogue's effective wizard level is her rogue level -4. The rogue must have the minor magic and major magic talents before she can choose this trick.</p><p><i>Getaway Master (Ex):</i> A rogue with this talent gains a +10 bonus on all drive checks. The rogue must have the getaway artist rogue talent before choosing this talent.</p><p><i>Hard to Fool (Ex):</i> A rogue with this talent is hard to fool with mind-affecting effects. At the start of her turn, if she is still subject to any mind-affecting spells or effects, she can make a Will saving throw with a standard DC for the effect's level, and if she succeeds at the check, she is no longer subject to the mind-affecting effect. She can make this saving throw even against mind-affecting effects that normally don't allow a saving throw. In those cases, generate the saving throw as if the spell or effect did allow a saving throw.</p><p><i>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex):</i> A rogue with this talent can select a single terrain from the ranger's favored terrain list. She is a master at hiding in that terrain, and while within that terrain, she can use the Stealth skill to hide, even while being observed. A rogue may take this advanced talent more than once, each time selecting a different terrain from the favored terrain list.</p><p><i>Rumormonger (Ex):</i> A rogue with this talent can attempt to spread a rumor though a small town or larger settlement by making a Bluff check. She can do so a number of times per week equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 0). The DC is based on the size of the settlement, and it takes a week for the rumor to propagate through the settlement. If the check succeeds, the rumor is practically accepted as fact within the community; succeeding by 5 or more over the DC decreases the time it takes the rumor to propagate by 1d4 days. A failed check means the rumor failed to gain traction, while failing by 5 or more causes the opposite of the rumor or some other competing theory involving the rumor's subject to take hold.</p><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><b>Community Size</b></td><td><b>DC</b></td></tr><tr><td>Small town</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Large town</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Small city</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Large city</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Metropolis</td><td>35</td></tr></table><p><i>Unwitting Ally (Ex):</i> A rogue with this talent can spend a swift action to attempt to make an opponent act like an ally for purposes of providing a flank until the beginning of the rogue's next turn. The opponent must be able to hear and see the rogue, and the rogue must succeed at a Bluff check opposed by the opponent's Sense Motive. If the check succeeds, the opponent acts as an ally for the purpose of providing a flank. Whether or not the check succeeds, the rogue cannot use this trick again on the same opponent for the next 24 hours. If the rogue fails the check by 5 or more, she cannot use the unwitting ally ability on any opponent within line of sight of the failed attempt for 24 hours.</p><p><i>Weapon Snatcher (Ex):</i> A rogue with this talent can make a Sleight of Hand check in place of a combat maneuver check when attempting to disarm an opponent.</p></text>\n            <img src=\"worlds/Fresh/Pathfinder%20Ultimate%20Combat/images/Masked%20Rogue.jpg\"/>","_id":"rL6sVRI31wJOSull"}

Finding firearms useful for taking down large and dangerous prey, they enter the fight with the crack of black powder fire, often ranging far and wide in their safaris and searches for ever-more-dangerous denizens of the wild to track, study, appreciate-and kill. While this might strike some as going against the ranger's usual respect for nature and the creatures of the wild, trophy hunters understand that they are just more pieces in nature's grand puzzle, and that the laws of the jungle-the right to kill and feed on those weaker than you, and the need to establish dominance through cunning and bloodshed-are both their rights and their duty as the current top of the food chain.</p><p><b>Improved Tracking (Ex):</b> At 1st level, a trophy hunter gains a +2 bonus on Survival skill checks when following or identifying tracks. When he tracks, he can also attempt a Knowledge (nature) check at DC 15. On a success, the trophy hunter can discern the type and condition of any animals or magical beasts he tracks.

This ability replaces wild empathy.</p><p><b>Firearm Style:</b> At 2nd level, a trophy hunter gains the Amateur Gunslinger feat, and can use any 1st-level gunslinger deed (page 10). At every four levels thereafter, the trophy hunter can take a grit feat or select a gunslinger deed of his level or lower, ranger's choice. This ability replaces combat feat style.</p><p><b>Hunter's Aim (Ex):</b> At 4th level, a trophy hunter gains a specific understanding of the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of his favored enemies, and his careful study of these enemies reveals the best way to hurt them. When the trophy hunter makes a firearm attack against a favored enemy, he can target touch AC in the first two range increments of his firearm. This ability stacks with other effects that increase the range increments to target touch AC, adding one range increment to the effect. This ability replaces hunter's bond.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"roK2gu8H6td3Y8me"}

Such discussions typically happen before the duel, allowing both sides to properly prepare, but as with all elements of a duel, this is not always the case. Most duels utilize the following simple rules.</p><list><li>Each participant must fight alone and can receive no help from outside sources, with the exception of other creatures who are taking part in the duel, such as familiars, animal companions, or other bonded creatures. If the duel consists of more than one participant on a side, those fighting alongside one another are free to aid each other.</li><li>The types of weapons that can be used in the duel are agreed upon before the duel begins. Typical restrictions include only using melee weapons, ranged weapons, unarmed (or natural) weapons, magic, or any combination of these. The rules of a duel may require all duel participants to use the same weapon or types of attacks. This is especially the case in duels that require swords, spells, or firearms. Absent any such rules, any type of weapon is permissible.</li><li>The duel usually lasts until one of the combatants has been knocked unconscious or otherwise prevented from continuing. Spells such as hold person do not end duels, but flesh to stone certainly does, assuming the target fails her saving throw. Some duels go to the death and are only ended when one duelist or team is cut to pieces or reduced to a pile of smoking ashes. Other duels last until first blood, first strike, or a number of successful attacks. These latter types of duels are usually intended to settle disputes where a creature's death is not the required end result.</li><li>In the case of duels that exclusively use magic, additional rules might prohibit the use of summoned or conjured creatures, unless the duel is performed by such creatures at the behest of the spellcasters involved (as is common among druids and summoners).</li><li>In the case of duels exclusively among warriors, additional rules typically prohibit the use of poison or even entire types of attacks (such as prohibiting ranged attacks, or requiring the use of firearms). In addition, most such duels prohibit the use of magic that affects other participants, although spells that enhance the caster are sometimes allowed.</li></list></text>\n            ","_id":"rsPXLS2BepR3Afha"}

In this manner, each armor piece is treated as its own type of armor, but most armorers and magic item crafters know that this is an inefficient way of making and enchanting armor.</p><p>The most efficient way to create masterwork armor or to enchant magical armor is to create or enchant the same suit. In order to do this, the suit's pieces need not all be of the same type, but they must be constructed and then enchanted together. The drawback is that none of the individual pieces are considered masterwork or magical on their own (though if magic, they do detect as magic, and can be identified as part of an armor suit). When used as piecemeal armor, they function like normal pieces of nonmagical and non-masterwork pieces of armor of their type.</p><p>If a character is wearing pieces of separately created or enchanted armor, the armor only takes the benefits provided by the masterwork quality and the magic of the most protective piece-typically the torso armor piece. If a character does not wear a torso armor piece, the most protective piece is the leg armor piece (the second most protective category of armor pieces), followed by the arm armor piece (the third most protective category).</p><p>For instance, if a character does not wear a torso or leg armor piece, but wears a +1 chain arm armor piece, she gains the benefit of wearing magic armor (the piece acts as masterwork and has a +1 enhancement bonus due to the enchantment). If that character then puts on a normal chain torso armor piece, she loses the +1 bonus due to magic and the reduction of armor check penalties for being masterwork, as the most protective armor piece no longer has either of these qualities.</p><p>In order for the armor to gain the benefits of a special material, all armor pieces worn must be made of the same special material. Because of this, armor pieces constructed of special materials can be constructed at a decreased cost based on which pieces are made of the special material. Constructing a whole suit of armor with the same special materials uses the standard costs detailed in the Core Rulebook.</p><p>In the case of chain shirts, breastplates, agile breastplates, and any other armor pieces that are treated as a category lighter when worn alone, to determine the cost of creating that piece of armor from a special material, use the base armor category (medium in the case of a chain torso armor piece, and heavy in the case of a plate torso armor piece) when pricing the item, but in the case of adamantine and similar armors, the item gains the material benefit of the lighter category (damage reduction 1/- in the case of the chain torso armor piece worn as a chain shirt, or damage reduction 2/- in the case of plate torso armor piece worn as a breastplate).</p></text>\n            ","_id":"sSuslJuWS9cFTIyg"}

Against evil targets, the holy tactician gains her Charisma bonus (if any) on her attack rolls against evil creatures, and if she hits, she adds 1/2 her paladin level on her weapon damage rolls as well.

The bonus on damage rolls increases by +1 for every five levels the holy tactician attains (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). She can grant this bonus against more than one creature at a time. To gain this benefit, the holy tactician's allies must be able to see or hear her, and she must be conscious.</p><p>At 4th level, and every three levels thereafter, the holy tactician may use weal's champion one additional time per day (to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level).

She gains an additional bonus feat for every four levels attained after 3rd, to a maximum of five bonus feats at 19th level. This ability replaces divine health and divine bond.</p><p><b>Battlefield Presence (Su):</b> At 3rd level, a tactician can direct her allies in battle, granting each ally within 30 feet one teamwork feat she possesses as a bonus feat as a standard action. All allies must receive the same feat, but do not need to meet the prerequisites of this bonus feat. This ability does not function if the paladin is flat-footed or unconscious. Allies must be able to see and hear the holy tactician in order to gain this benefit. Changing the bonus feat granted is a swift action.

Each ally (if physically able to) can move 5 feet without expending an action. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The allies must be able to see or hear the paladin in order to make this movement and cannot be flat-footed. At 15th level, her allies can make this 5-foot move and ignore difficult terrain. This ability replaces aura of resolve.</p><p><b>Weal's Wrath (Su):</b> At 11th level, a tactician can expend two uses of her weal's champion ability at once to enhance its effects. This functions as weal's champion, except the bonus she provides to her allies lasts until each creature she strikes is slain, her weal's champion ability expires, or the paladin herself is slain or knocked unconscious, whichever happens first. This ability replaces aura of justice.</p><p><b>Masterful Presence (Su):</b> At 20th level, a tactician gains the ability to grant a different bonus feat to each ally affected by her battlefield presence. In addition, all critical threats made by her and her allies against creatures affected by her weal's champion ability are automatically confirmed (no confirmation roll is needed).

While these heads help them travel great distances, they make the arrows less effective at dealing damage. Iron-tipped distance arrows increase their bow's range increment by 10 feet but take a -1 penalty on damage dealt per range increment (minimum 1 point of damage). They are sold in leather quivers in quantities of 20.</p><p><b>Arrow, Whistling:</b> These arrows come with specially designed grooves and fletching that cause them to emit a loud keening sound audible within 500 feet of their flight path. They are sold in quantities of 20.</p><p><b>Bamboo Shaft Arrow:</b> These foot-long arrows are used as ammunition for arrow tubes. As an improvised melee weapon, they deal damage equivalent to a spiked gauntlet. They come in a bamboo tube that holds 10 shafts.</p><p><b>Bo Staff:</b> Similar to a quarterstaff, only slightly more slender and tapered at one end, the bo staff is both a defensive device and a weapon.</p><p><b>Broadsword, Nine-Ring:</b> This broad-bladed weapon has nine heavy rings threaded through its spine, providing additional weight to add to the force of its impressive chopping power.</p><p><b>Butterfly Sword:</b> These short matching swords come in pairs, cleverly nested together to appear as a single blade. Both weapons can be drawn at the same time, and they can be separated as a free action and wielded in both hands to make wickedly effective chops and slashes. Their thin, broad blades extend just 1 foot in length. A butterfly sword has a hardwood grip covered with braided cord, and a metal D-shaped guard to protect the wielder's hand.</p><p><b>Dan Bong:</b> These short, blunt sticks are held in the hands to enhance unarmed martial techniques. They provide the wielder with the ability to lock an opponent and target pressure points that grant her a +2 bonus on her combat maneuver to grapple.</p><p><b>Double Chicken Saber:</b> The tip of this 3-foot-long, straight-bladed sword is bent into two staggered, opposing sharpened spurs that can be used to pull weapons from an opponent's hands.</p><p><b>Emei Piercer:</b> This weapon is used to augment unarmed martial techniques. It consists of an 8- to 10-inch-long, dual-pointed steel spike set on swivels and mounted on a ring, so that it can be spun around at high speeds when slipped over the wielder's ring finger. The ring prevents the wielder from being disarmed and turns unarmed strikes into piercing attacks.</p><p><b>Fighting Fan:</b> Made to resemble a courtier's fan, this device consists of silk paper stretched and folded over a folding frame of hardened steel. Folding fans are typically wielded in pairs using a technique that distracts the opponent. The fans sport sharp tips, which can be poisoned.</p><p><b>Hooked Lance:</b> This slender, 10-foot-long polearm has an added hook protruding from the head that is used to snag the clothing and armor of opponents.</p><p><b>Iron Brush:</b> This is an iron-handled version of a scholar's brush with a sharpened handle. Though it does little damage, it is easily concealed (the wielder gets a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand skill checks made to conceal a iron brush on her body) and can be used as a jabbing weapon or thrown short distances.</p><p><b>Jutte:</b> This batonlike weapon is fitted with a metal hook that can be used to block and pin an opponent's weapon. Some variations are tipped with a sharpened metal spike or blade.</p><p><b>Kama, Double-Chained:</b> This weapon comprises a pair of kama connected with an 8-foot length of chain. The wielder can attack as if armed with a single kama in each hand or extend the chain to make a single reach attack. By swinging the rope, the wielder can whip the kama about to disarm or trip opponents. Furthermore, if one of the weapons is dropped, the wielder can retrieve as a free action by pulling on the chain.</p><p><b>Katana:</b> Specifically constructed for samurai, katanas employ multiple types of steel combined in a distinctive forging process. The result are swords noted for their wickedly sharp yet slender, gently curved blades, designed to make graceful hacking strokes capable of severing opponents' heads and limbs. Though finely balanced, these blades are difficult to master. Characters can use a katana two-handed as a martial weapon, but must take the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (katana) feat to use it one-handed.</p><p><b>Katana, Double Walking Stick:</b> This single case conceals a pair of matched fighting swords perfectly balanced to be wielded as a pair. Despite their name, the blades more closely resemble the shorter wakizashi. When the blades are concealed in their case, this weapon can be used as a quarterstaff.</p><p><b>Kerambit:</b> This small, curved pull dagger has a metal loop at the base of its handle allowing it to be secured with a pinky or worn on a string tied in the hair. While relatively small, the curved blade can create brutal wounds. Easily concealed (the wielder gets a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand skill checks made to conceal a kerambit on her body), it is a favorite concealed weapon of ninja and assassins.</p><p><b>Kusarigama:</b> This weapon has a single sickle held in the off-hand attached by 10 feet of fine chain to a weighted metal ball. The sickle is used to make trips, jabs, and blocks while the ball is whipped around at high speeds and then smashed into the opponent.</p><p><b>Kyoketsu Shoge:</b> This weapon consists of a foot-long double-edged blade, with another smaller, curved hook-blade sticking out the side like a rooster's spur. The blade is strung to a large iron hoop with 10-foot length of rope. The blade can be used as an off-hand melee weapon or thrown like a dagger, while the rope and circlet can be whipped around and swung at opponents as a bludgeoning reach weapon.</p><p><b>Lungchuan Tamo (Hidden Daggers):</b> What appears to be an ordinary baton sheaths a pair of matching slender-bladed daggers, perfectly balanced throwing blades.</p><p><b>Meteor Hammer:</b> This weapon consists of one or two spherical weights attached by a 10-foot chain. You whirl the weights and wrap them around an opponent's body. If you succeed at a trip attempt with a meteor hammer, you can drag your opponent 5 feet closer to you rather than knocking her prone. You may use this weapon in two different ways: in meteor mode you use it as a double weapon, while in fortress mode you cannot use it as a double weapon but gain reach and a +1 shield bonus to AC. Switching between these two modes is a free action decided at the start of your turn.</p><p><b>Monk's Spade:</b> This weapon is a double weapon pole arm. One side is fitted with a broad, shovel-like sharpened blade while the opposite side is fitted with a crescent blade that juts out like a pair of bull's horns. The monk's spade does many types of damage. What type of damage it deals depends on how it is wielded, with the spade side able to bludgeon or slash and the crescent side able to jab, slash, and pierce.</p><p><b>Naginata:</b> The naginata consists of a 6-foot staff affixed to a 2-foot-long, swordlike slightly curved blade. The shaft is designed to keep the wielder out of reach from swords and shorter weapons.</p><p><b>Nine-Section Whip:</b> The nine-section whip consists of steel bars linked together. The final bar is a 6-inch weighted spike. This weapon can be wielded as a single-handed weapon, a two-handed weapon, or in pairs.</p><p><b>Nodachi:</b> This very long two-handed weapon has a slender but wickedly sharp 4-foot-long blade at one end. It is predominantly used by ground troops to attack mounted warriors, and can be used to hack riders from their mounts or set to receive a charge.</p><p><b>Poisoned Sand Tube:</b> Resembling a slender bamboo or metal scroll case, this tube is filled with fine sand that is soaked or coated with inhaled or contact poison. When loaded with 3 doses of these types of poison, the wielder blows into the tube, dispersing the poisoned sand into her enemies' faces in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the cone is affected as if afflicted with 1 dose of the poison. Even when loaded with unpoisoned sand, the tube lets loose a powerful irritant, and an opponent struck must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude saving throw or be dazzled for 1 round. Once expended, the tube must be repacked before it can be used again. Repacking a tube requires a full-round action, or a standard action if the wielder has the Rapid Reload feat.</p><p><b>Rope Dart:</b> This deceptively complex weapon appears as nothing more than a 12-foot rope with a 6-inch-long, conical metal spike. Similar to a meteor hammer, it can be whirled at great speeds, then aimed to strike and pierce opponents with great reach. Once it strikes, the wielder can quickly retrieve the weapon with a tug of the rope.</p><p><b>Sansetsukon (Three-Section Staff):</b> This staff is broken into three 2-foot-long segments that have been chained back together, allowing the wielder greater flexibility, and allows the weapon to be swung rapidly to create a defensive block.</p><p><b>Shang Gou:</b> Forged in pairs, these solid metal blades end in curved hooks, while the hand guards are hammered into outward-facing spiked crescents. Both the crescent and the tip of the hilt are sharpened for combat. They can be wielded as single weapons or with two-weapon fighting styles. The weapons gain the disarm special weapon feature when used individually. A pair of shang gou can also be formed into a single one-handed weapon to gain the trip special feature.</p><p><b>Sibat:</b> This weapon is similar to a shortspear with a flexible rattan or bamboo shaft and an elaborately barbed head. On a critical hit, the spear grabs flesh or armor. The wielder can then attempt a combat maneuver check to attempt to grapple its opponent as a free action. This grapple attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the creature you are attempting to grapple. While grappling the target with a sibat, the wielder can only move or damage the target on its turn. The wielder is still considered grappled, though it does not have to be adjacent to the target to continue the grapple. If you move far away to be out of the sibat's reach, you end the grapple with that action.</p><p><b>Sword, Seven-Branched:</b> This unusual sword has a straight 2-foot-long blade with six shorter L-shaped blades protruding, three on each side in a staggered pattern. The shorter blades can be used to snag opponents' clothing or armor, or can target weapons in order to disarm them. To snag armor or clothing, the attacker makes a trip attempt. If successful, the victim doesn't fall prone, but instead is snagged and stumbles forward, leaving the victim flat-footed for the remainder of the round.</p><p><b>Tekko-Kagi:</b> Also known as the iron claw, this device consists of a fanlike structure of five 10-inch blades secured to a sturdy handle strapped to the forearm of the off-hand. It can be used an offensive weapon, defensively like a buckler, or to disarm an opponent's weapon without provoking an attack of opportunity. It provides its owner with a +2 circumstance bonus on attempts to disarm or sunder swords or other slender-bladed weapons.</p><p><b>Tetsubo:</b> A slight improvement over the great club, this weapon consists of a long, slender length whose upper half is shod with a thick sheet of studded iron. The iron gives added weight and strength to the club, while the studs are designed to crack helmets and armor.</p><p><b>Tiger Fork:</b> This long, tridentlike weapon consists of a three-pronged metal fork set upon an 8-foot-long shaft. It is wielded much like a staff, with the wielder grasping the shaft from the center and jabbing its forked end. A tiger fork can be set to receive a charge.</p><p><b>Tonfa:</b> These L-shaped fighting sticks are good for striking and blocking combinations. The wielder holds the handle and either spins the stick or strikes with the stick covering the forearm.</p><p><b>Tri-Point Double-Edged Sword:</b> Topping the head of this 5-foot-long shaft are three long, backward-curved blades fashioned in the appearance of a blossoming lotus. The unusually large head is designed to land heavy blows and multiple wounds that open away from each other.</p><p><b>Tube Arrow Shooter:</b> This weapon consists of a small metal tube hidden within a sleeve; the tube holds a short, spring-loaded bamboo shaft. The wielder gains a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand skill checks made to conceal an arrow tube shooter on his body. Releasing the fastener allows the spring to force the arrow out. Once a shaft is fired, the tube must be reloaded before it can be used again. Reloading a tube is a full-round action, or a standard action if the wielder has the Rapid Reload feat.</p><p><b>Urumi:</b> Commonly known as a whip sword, this deadly weapon is fashioned from one to four 5-foot-long, razor-sharp blades of flexible steel. The weapon is wielded by whipping the blades at one's opponent. The coiled blade is fine and flexible enough to be worn as a belt.</p><p><b>Wakizashi:</b> These short, slender blades are between 1 to 2 feet long.

With her faith, she can ward others from harm.</p><p><b>Bastion of Good (Su):</b> At 1st level, a sacred shield can call upon the powers of good to defend her and her allies against evil. This ability functions as smite evil, except that the paladin gains no benefit on attack or damage rolls against her target. Instead, any attacks the target makes against allies within 10 feet of the paladin deal half damage. Attacks against the paladin deal full damage, but the paladin gains a deflection bonus to her AC equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) against attacks made by the target of the smite. This bonus increases by +1 for every four paladin levels (to a maximum of +6 at 20th level). As with smite evil, if the paladin targets a creature that is not evil, her bastion of good ability is wasted with no effect. Feats, abilities, and the like that increase a paladin's number of uses of smite evil per day increase a sacred shield's uses of bastion of good per day. This ability replaces smite evil.</p><p><b>Holy Shield (Su):</b> At 4th level, a sacred shield can channel her faith into her shield, protecting any nearby allies. All allies adjacent to the paladin gain a shield bonus equal to the sacred shield's own shield bonus, including any increase from the shield's enhancement bonus. This bonus does not stack with any existing shield bonuses. The paladin herself radiates light as a light spell while the shielding is active. At 11th level, this protection expands to cover any allies within 10 feet and the radiance increases to the effects of a daylight spell. At 20th level, any allies within 20 feet are protected. Using this ability consumes two uses of the sacred shield's lay on hands ability, and the effects last for 3 rounds plus a number of rounds equal to her Charisma bonus (if any). This ability replaces channel positive energy.</p><p><b>Divine Bond (Su):</b> At 5th level, instead of forming a divine bond with her weapon or a mount, a sacred shield forms a bond with her shield. As a standard action, a sacred shield can enhance her shield by calling on the aid of a celestial spirit. This bond lasts for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the shield to shed light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants the shield a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the shield gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the shield, stacking with existing enhancement bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following armor special abilities: arrow deflection, bashing, blinding, fortification (any), reflecting, and spell resistance (any). The reflecting enhancement may be used once each time the sacred shield makes use of her divine bond. Adding these armor special abilities consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-4 on page 485 of the Core Rulebook). These bonuses are added to any properties the shield already has, but duplicate special abilities do not grant any extra benefit. If the shield is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other special abilities can be added. The bonus and special abilities granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The celestial spirit imparts no bonuses if the shield is used by anyone other than the sacred shield, but it resumes giving bonuses if the sacred shield resumes using the shield. A sacred shield can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a maximum of four times per day at 17th level.</p><p>If a shield with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the sacred shield loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this period, the sacred shield takes a -1 penalty to her armor class and on saving throws.</p><p><b>Improved Bastion:</b> At 11th level, the radius of a sacred shield's bastion of good ability increases to 20 feet. This ability replaces the paladin's aura of justice.</p><p><b>Perfect Bastion:</b> At 20th level, a sacred shield and her allies within 20 feet gain regeneration 10 against the target of her bastion of good ability (essentially regeneration that is overcome by any damage not caused by the target). This ability replaces the sacred shield's holy champion ability.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"vbJi3BlmuruZhtSU"}

These gun tanks trundle into battle with barrels blazing, dealing out punishment with their firearms while knowing few can penetrate their hard protective shells.</p><p>Armor Proficiency: A gun tank is proficient with all armors and shields, including tower shields.</p><p><b>Deeds:</b> A gun tank swaps a pair of deeds for the following. The new deed descriptions include information on which deeds from the gunslinger class feature these new deeds replace.</p><p><i>Gun Tank's Resolve (Ex):</i> At 1st level, the gun tank can shrug off the most serious of attacks. When the gun tank is wearing medium or heavy armor and is subject to a critical hit or sneak attack, she can spend 1 grit point as an immediate action to attempt to negate the critical hit or sneak attack damage. At 1st level, she has a 25% chance of doing so. At 10th level, the chance increases to 50%. At 15th level, the chance increases to 75%. While a gun tank's resolve does not stack with the fortification armor special ability, it does work in concert with that armor special ability or similar effects, so a gun tank can use this ability even after the armor of fortification has failed to negate the critical hit or sneak attack damage. This deed replaces the gunslinger's dodge deed.</p><p><i>Gun Tank's Resilience (Ex):</i> At 15th level, when the gun tank has at least 1 grit point and makes a successful Fortitude saving throw against an attack that would deal half damage or have a partial effect, she takes no damage or other effects from that attack. Furthermore, she gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against fear and mind-affecting effects. This deed replaces the evasive deed.</p><p><b>Bullet Defection (Ex):</b> A gun tank is adept at modifying and using her armor to stop firearm attacks. Starting at 2nd level, a gun tank wearing medium or heavy armor gains half the armor's bonus plus the armor's enhancement bonus (if any) as a deflection bonus against any non-siege firearm or splash weapon attack (including the alchemist's bomb class ability; Advanced Player's Guide 28). This ability has no affect on spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities that make a touch attack. This ability replaces nimble.</p><p><b>Armor Training (Ex):</b> At 4th level, a gun tank learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever she is wearing armor, the armor check penalty is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by her armor increases by 1. Every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and 16th), the bonus increases by 1, to a maximum of a -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase to the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed. This ability stacks with the fighter class ability of the same name. If the gun tank has both class features, she takes the most advantageous benefit of the two class features. This ability replaces the bonus feats the gunslinger gains at 4th level and every four levels thereafter.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"x4eUZzKHZPTN6jgC"}

Whether tapping into totems of power or unleashing mighty reserves of rage and destruction, a barbarian lives in a world of battle, a place of barely controlled emotion and unrelenting bloodshed.</p><p>Presented here are a number of new barbarian rage powers and archetypes that allow a barbarian to tap into new sources of savage power, expanding your choices when building such characters and providing different types of barbarians for you to play. Many of the new rage powers increase rage powers already presented in the Core Rulebook and Advanced Player's Guide. Others are brand new, providing new manifestations of a barbarian's powerful rages.</p><p>The new barbarian archetypes also suggest rage powers-though not mandatory, these choices complement the theme and the features of each archetype. Rage powers marked with a single asterisk (*) are detailed in this book. Rage powers marked with two asterisks (**) are described in the Advanced Player's Guide. All other rage powers are detailed in the Core Rulebook.</p><p><b>Rage Powers:</b> Any barbarian who meets the powers' prerequisites can select and use the following new rage powers. Totem rage powers grant powers related to a theme. A barbarian cannot select from more than one group of totem rage powers; for example, a barbarian who selects a beast totem rage power (see the Advanced Player's Guide) cannot later choose to gain any of the dragon totem rage powers (any rage power with \"dragon totem\" in its title), unless she has the totem warrior archetype.</p><p><i>Auspicious Mark (Su):</i> The barbarian has been marked by the spirits, as indicated by an impressive tattoo, scar, or birthmark she possesses. Once per rage, as a swift action that costs 2 rounds of rage, the barbarian can call upon the spirits' favor. Using auspicious mark grants her a +1d6 bonus on one d20 roll she has just made. She can call on the auspicious mark after seeing the result of the d20 roll.</p><p><i>Bestial Climber (Ex):</i> While raging, the barbarian gains a natural climb speed equal to her land speed. A barbarian must have the raging climber rage power and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Bestial Leaper (Ex):</i> While raging, the barbarian can take a move action to move and can take her normal standard action at any point during the move. A barbarian must have the raging leaper rage power and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Bestial Swimmer (Ex):</i> While raging, the barbarian gains a natural swim speed equal to her normal land speed. A barbarian must have the raging swimmer rage power and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Bleeding Blow (Ex):</i> When she uses her powerful blow rage power, the barbarian also deals bleed damage equal to her bonus damage with the powerful blow. This bleed damage bypasses damage reduction. A barbarian must have the powerful blow rage power and be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Body Bludgeon (Ex):</i> While raging, if the barbarian pins an opponent that is smaller than her, she can then use that opponent as a two-handed improvised weapon that deals 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage, assuming the opponent is sized Small. Larger or smaller creatures used as a bludgeon deal damage based on their size using this base damage. A size Tiny creature deals 1d6 points of damage, a size Medium creature deals 1d10 points of damage, and so on. The barbarian can make a single attack using the pinned opponent as part of the action she uses to maintain the grapple, using her highest attack bonus. Whenever the barbarian hits using the pinned opponent as a weapon, she deals damage to her target normally, and the grappled opponent used as a bludgeon also takes the same damage she dealt to the target. If the pinned opponent is unable to resist being pinned for any reason, the barbarian can use that opponent as an improvised weapon without grappling or pinning the opponent, until the creature is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, at which point the creature becomes useless as an improvised weapon. A barbarian must be at least 10th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Crippling Blow (Ex):</i> When using her powerful blow rage power, the barbarian can forgo the normal bonus to damage (including any bleed damage granted by the bleeding blow rage power or similar boosts to the damage of the powerful blow rage power) and instead deals 1 point of ability damage to the target's Strength or Dexterity score for every four class levels the barbarian has attained. The target can attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level + the barbarian's Strength modifier) to halve this ability damage. A barbarian must have the powerful blow rage power and be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Deadly Accuracy (Ex):</i> If the barbarian scores a critical threat when using her surprise accuracy rage power, she applies double the surprise accuracy bonus when rolling to confirm the critical. A barbarian must have the surprise accuracy rage power and be at least 4th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Dragon Totem (Su):</i> The barbarian must select a single color of dragon (black, blue, brass, bronze, copper, gold, green, red, silver, or white) as her totem. While raging, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks and a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against fear, paralysis, and sleep effects. This bonus increases by +1 for each additional dragon totem rage power (such as dragon totem resilience and dragon totem wings) the barbarian possesses. A barbarian must have the animal fury and intimidating glare rage powers and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Dragon Totem Resilience (Su):</i> While raging, the barbarian gains resistance to the energy type that is associated with her dragon totem-acid (black, copper, green), cold (silver, white), electricity (blue, bronze), or fire (brass, gold, red). This resistance equals double her current DR/- from her barbarian damage reduction class feature; this DR increases by 2 for each dragon totem rage power she possesses, including this one. A barbarian must have the dragon totem rage power and be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Dragon Totem Wings (Su):</i> When a barbarian selects this rage power, the Fly (Dex) skill becomes a class skill for her. While raging and wearing medium or lighter armor, the barbarian can spend a standard action to manifest a pair of spiritual dragon wings that grant her a fly speed equal to her base speed (average maneuverability). She can expend 2 rounds of her rage to instead spend an immediate action to gain this fly speed. She can end her fly speed at any time, even when it is not her turn. Each round she spends raging and flying counts as 2 rounds of rage. Her ability to fly ends automatically when she ceases raging. A barbarian must have the dragon totem and dragon totem resilience rage powers, and she must be at least 10th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Eater of Magic (Su):</i> Once per rage, when a barbarian fails a saving throw against a spell, supernatural ability, or spell-like ability, she can reroll the saving throw against the effect (this is not an action). If she succeeds at the second saving throw, she is not affected by the spell, supernatural ability, or spell-like ability and gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the effect's caster level (in the case of spell or spell-like abilities) or the CR of the effect's creator (in the case of supernatural abilities). These temporary hit points last until damage is applied to them or 1 minute, whichever occurs first. A barbarian must have the superstition rage power and be at least 10th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Ghost Rager (Su):</i> While raging, the barbarian deals normal damage to incorporeal creatures even when using nonmagical weapons. She also gains a morale bonus to touch AC equal to her saving throw bonus from her superstition rage power. A barbarian must have the superstition rage power and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Ground Breaker, Greater (Ex):</i> When using the ground breaker** rage power, the barbarian can extend the radius of the effect by 5 feet. This rage power can be selected up to three times, and its effects stack. A barbarian must have the ground breaker rage power and be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Guarded Life, Greater (Ex):</i> When using the guarded life** rage power, 1 additional hit point of lethal damage per barbarian level is converted to nonlethal damage. A barbarian must have the guarded life rage power and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Hive Totem (Su):</i> While raging, the barbarian takes half damage from attacks by swarms of vermin, including spells and effects that act like a swarm of vermin (like summon swarm used to summon spiders or insect plague). She also gains a +1 bonus on Strength ability checks and to CMD against bull rush, drag, and trip attacks for every four barbarian levels she has (maximum +5). A barbarian must have the animal fury power and be at least 4th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Hive Totem Resilience (Su):</i> While raging, the barbarian takes no damage from attacks by swarms of vermin, preventing harmful secondary effects of such attacks like poison or bleed. She also gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD when grappling for every four barbarian levels she has (maximum +5). A barbarian must have the hive totem rage power and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Hive Totem Toxicity (Su):</i> While raging, the barbarian increases her bite damage die type with the animal fury rage power by one die type and decreases the penalty on attack rolls with that bite to -2. Once per rage, a bite that hits can deliver an injury toxin that has a frequency of once per round for 4 rounds, deals 1d3 points of Constitution damage, and has a cure of one save. The saving throw has a Fortitude save DC of 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level + the barbarian's Constitution modifier. A barbarian must have the hive totem and hive totem resilience rage powers and be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Lethal Accuracy (Ex):</i> When using her surprise accuracy rage power, the barbarian's critical multiplier for damage increases by 1 (a ×2 multiplier becomes ×3, a 19-20/×2 multiplier becomes 19-20/×3, a ×3 multiplier becomes ×4, and a ×4 multiplier becomes ×5). A barbarian must have the surprise accuracy and deadly accuracy rage powers and be 16th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Perfect Clarity (Ex):</i> While using her moment of clarity rage power, the barbarian can roll twice for any miss chance or Will saving throws to disbelieve illusions, taking the better result. A barbarian must have the moment of clarity rage power before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Primal Scent (Ex):</i> When using her scent rage power, the barbarian adds half her barbarian level on Survival checks made to track by scent and on Perception checks to pinpoint the location of creatures she cannot see. If she pinpoints the location of a creature that has total concealment, she treats it as having concealment. A barbarian must have the scent rage power and be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Reflexive Dodge (Ex):</i> While using her rolling dodge rage power, the barbarian may apply her dodge bonus to AC as a bonus on Reflex saving throws. A barbarian must have the rolling dodge rage power and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Regenerative Vigor (Ex):</i> After using her renewed vigor rage power until her current rage ends, the barbarian gains fast healing 1 for every 6 barbarian levels she has (maximum fast healing 3). She regains hit points from fast healing at the start of each of her turns. A barbarian must have the renewed vigor rage power and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Renewed Life (Ex):</i> While raging, the barbarian ignores the effect of one temporary negative level per four barbarian levels she has (maximum 5). Once per day, when a barbarian with temporary negative levels ends her rage, she can attempt saving throws to remove a number of negative levels equal to the number of levels she could ignore while raging. A barbarian must have the renewed vitality rage power and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Renewed Vitality (Ex):</i> While raging, the barbarian ignores the effect of 1 point of ability penalty or damage per two barbarian levels she has (maximum 10). Once per day, when a barbarian with ability penalties or damage ends her rage, she can reroll a saving throw, if any, against an effect that imposed an ability penalty or dealt her ability damage. If successful, she removes an amount of ability penalty or damage equal to the amount she can ignore while raging. A barbarian must have the renewed vigor rage power and be at least 4th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Sharpened Accuracy (Ex):</i> When using her surprise accuracy rage power, the barbarian ignores the miss chance for concealment and treats total concealment as concealment. She also ignores cover penalties except those from total cover. A barbarian must have the surprise accuracy rage power and be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Spell Sunder (Su):</i> Once per rage, the barbarian can attempt to sunder an ongoing spell effect by succeeding at a combat maneuver check. For any effect other than one on a creature, the barbarian must make her combat maneuver check against a CMD of 15 plus the effect's caster level. To sunder an effect on a creature, the barbarian must succeed at a normal sunder combat maneuver against the creature's CMD + 5, ignoring any miss chance caused by a spell or spell-like ability. If successful, the barbarian suppresses the effect for 1 round, or 2 rounds if she exceeded the CMD by 5 to 9. If she exceeds the CMD by 10 or more, the effect is dispelled. A barbarian must have the witch hunter rage power and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Sprint (Ex):</i> Once per rage, the barbarian can use a single full-round run action to move up to 6 times her speed or a single full-round charge action to move up to 3 times her speed. A barbarian must have the swift foot rage power and be at least 4th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>Sunder Enchantment (Su):</i> While raging, whenever the barbarian succeeds at a sunder combat maneuver on a magical item, that item's magical abilities are suppressed for 1 round, plus 1 round for every 5 points by which her combat maneuver check exceeded the target's CMD. A barbarian must have the spell sunder rage power and be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>World Serpent Totem (Su):</i> While raging, the barbarian gains a +1 insight bonus to AC against outsiders and aberrations. This bonus increases by +1 for each world serpent rage power the barbarian possesses, excluding this one.</p><p><i>World Serpent Spirit (Su):</i> While raging, the barbarian considers her weapons to be chaotic-, evil-, good-, and lawful-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. She also gains a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against spells and effects that have an alignment descriptor or come from an outsider or aberration. This bonus increases by +1 for each world serpent rage power the barbarian possesses, excluding this one. A barbarian must have the world serpent totem rage power and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</p><p><i>World Serpent Totem Unity (Su):</i> While raging, the barbarian doubles her fast movement bonus to land speed and cannot be knocked prone. She also doubles her world serpent totem insight bonus to AC against attack rolls made by an outsider or aberration to confirm a critical hit against her. A barbarian must have the world serpent totem and world serpent totem spirit rage powers and be at least 10th level before selecting this rage power.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"yuuwtoXYUvGSrv5N"}

That is to say, if a suit of armor is actually protecting the wearer from attacks that strike but simply fail to cause the wearer harm, why then do we say that armor reduces the chance of a hit? The abstraction has been clarified in the rules by defining what it means to be \"hit\" in combat as actually being \"hit in such a way as to effectively cause harm,\" but this explanation is still not enough for some players.</p><p>The following is an alternative system that allows armor to absorb the damage of attacks, rather than a system that provides an abstract way of determining when a hit does actual harm. Like all the rules presented in this chapter, it is a variant to the base system of the Pathfinder RPG. It is for GMs who want armor to reduce damage rather than increase Armor Class, and replaces the normal rules for armor.</p><p>In this system, a creatures no longer has an Armor Class. Instead it has a Defense score that a foe's attack roll must meet or exceed to hit the creature. Then any damage is reduced by damage reduction based on the creature's armor worn and any natural armor bonus the creature has. Furthermore, armor has a chance of reducing all critical hits to normal hits, by replacing the confirmation roll for critical hits with a critical defense check made by the creature threatened by the critical hit.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"z2j51rmUyqPa45Az"}

They are proficient with light armor but not with shields.</p><p><b>Poison Use:</b> At 1st level, a ninja is trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison herself when applying poison to a weapon.</p><p><b>Sneak Attack:</b> If a ninja can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p><p>The ninja's attacks deal extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the ninja flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every two ninja levels thereafter. Bonus damage from sneak attacks is precision damage. Should the ninja score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this precision damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p><p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, whip, or unarmed strike), a ninja can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, even with the usual -4 penalty.</p><p>The ninja must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot, and must be able to reach this spot. A ninja cannot sneak attack while striking a creature that has concealment.</p><p><b>Ki Pool (Su):</b> At 2nd level, a ninja gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy she can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in the ninja's ki pool is equal to 1/2 her ninja level + her Charisma modifier. As long as she has at least 1 point in her ki pool, she treats any Acrobatics skill check made to jump as if she had a running start. At 10th level, she also reduces the DC of Acrobatics skill checks made to jump by 1/2 (although she still cannot move farther than her speed allows).</p><p>By spending 1 point from her ki pool, a ninja can make one additional attack at her highest attack bonus, but she can do so only when making a full attack. In addition, she can spend 1 point to increase her speed by 20 feet for 1 round. Finally, a ninja can spend 1 point from her ki pool to give herself a +4 insight bonus on Stealth checks for 1 round. Each of these powers is activated as a swift action. A ninja can gain additional powers that consume points from her ki pool by selecting certain ninja tricks.</p><p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. If the ninja possesses levels in another class that grants points to a ki pool, ninja levels stack with the levels of that class to determine the total number of ki points in the combined pool, but only one ability score modifier is added to the total. The choice of which score to use is made when the second class ability is gained, and once made, the choice is set. The ninja can now use ki points from this pool to power the abilities of every class she possesses that grants a ki pool.</p><p><b>Ninja Tricks:</b> As a ninja continues her training, she learns a number of tricks that allow her to confuse her foes and grant her supernatural abilities. Starting at 2nd level, a ninja gains one ninja trick. She gains one additional ninja trick for every 2 levels attained after 2nd. Unless otherwise noted, a ninja cannot select an individual ninja trick more than once.</p><p>Tricks marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to a ninja's sneak attack. Only one of these tricks can be applied to an individual attack and the decision must be made before the attack is made.</p><p><i>Acrobatic Master (Su):</i> As a swift action, a ninja with this trick can focus her ki to grant her a +20 bonus on one Acrobatics check of her choice made before the start of her next turn. Using this ability expends 1 ki point from her ki pool.</p><p><i>Bleeding Attack* (Ex):</i> A ninja with this trick can cause living opponents to bleed by hitting them with a sneak attack. This attack causes the target to take 1 additional point of damage each round for each die of the ninja's sneak attack. Bleeding creatures take that amount of damage every round at the start of each of their turns. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or the application of any effect that heals hit point damage. Bleed damage from this ability does not stack with itself. Bleed damage bypasses any DR the creature might possess.</p><p><i>Choking Bomb (Ex):</i> Whenever a ninja throws a smoke bomb, all living creatures in the resulting cloud must make a Fortitude save or become staggered by the choking black smoke for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ninja's level + the ninja's Charisma modifier. The ninja can decide to create an ordinary smoke bomb or add poison to this smoke bomb as normal. The ninja must have the poison bomb ninja trick before selecting this trick.</p><p><i>Combat Trick:</i> A ninja who selects this trick gains a bonus combat feat.</p><p><i>Darkvision (Su):</i> This trick allows the ninja to use her ki to enhance her sight, granting darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. Using this trick is a standard action that costs 1 ki point. The enhanced senses last for 1 hour.</p><p><i>Deadly Range (Ex):</i> A ninja with this ninja trick increases the range at which she can deal sneak attack damage by 10 feet. A ninja can take this trick more than once. Its effects stack.</p><p><i>Deflect Arrows:</i> A ninja who selects this ninja trick gains the Deflect Arrows feat as a bonus feat. The ninja must have the Improved Unarmed Strike combat feat before taking this trick.</p><p><i>Fast Stealth (Ex):</i> A ninja with this trick can move at full speed using the Stealth skill without penalty.</p><p><i>Feather Fall (Su):</i> As an immediate action, the ninja can slow her descent as if using feather fall. This ability uses her ninja level as the caster level. Each use of this ability uses up 1 ki point.</p><p><i>Flurry of Stars (Ex):</i> A ninja with this ability can expend 1 ki point from her ki pool as a swift action before she makes a full-attack attack with shuriken. During that attack, she can throw two additional shuriken at her highest attack bonus, but all of her shuriken attacks are made at a -2 penalty, including the two extra attacks.</p><p><i>Forgotten Trick (Ex):</i> A ninja with this ability can recall one trick taught to her by her ancient masters. When she uses this ability, she selects one ninja trick (not a master trick or rogue talent) that she does not know and can use that ninja trick for a number of rounds equal to her level. She must pay any ki costs associated with the trick as normal. Using this ability expends 2 ki point from her ki pool, plus the ki cost of the trick she chooses.</p><p><i>Hidden Weapons (Ex):</i> A ninja with this ability can easily conceal weapons on her body. The ninja adds her level on opposed Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal a weapon. In addition, she can draw hidden weapons as a move action, instead of as a standard action.</p><p><i>High Jumper (Ex):</i> When a ninja with this trick makes a high jump, the DC for that jump is half the normal DC. The ninja must have the acrobatic master trick before taking this talent.</p><p><i>Ki Block* (Su):</i> A ninja with this trick can prevent a creature from using its ki pool. Whenever the ninja deals sneak attack damage, the target must make a Will save or be unable to spend any points from its ki pool for a number of rounds equal to the ninja's Charisma modifier. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the ninja's level + the ninja's Charisma modifier. The number of points in the target's ki pool is unaffected, and abilities that do not require the subject to spend ki still function.</p><p><i>Ki Charge (Su):</i> A ninja with this trick can invest a portion of her ki into a single thrown weapon, such as a shuriken, and throw it as a standard action. The thrown weapon explodes on impact in a 5-foot burst, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage plus 1d6 points of fire damage for every four levels of the ninja above 2nd, to a maximum 4d6 at 18th level. Creatures caught in the blast receive a Reflex save to halve the damage. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the ninja's level + the ninja's Charisma modifier. If the thrown weapon hits a creature, that creature takes a -2 penalty on the saving throw. If the thrown weapon misses, treat it as a thrown splash weapon. Using this ability expends 1 ki point from her ki pool.</p><p><i>Poison Bomb (Ex):</i> Whenever the ninja throws a smoke bomb, she can decide to include 1 dose of any inhaled poison she possesses. This poison affects all creatures in the smoke and lasts as long as the smoke lasts. She must pay for the poison normally. The ninja must have the smoke bomb ninja trick before selecting this trick.</p><p><i>Pressure Points* (Su):</i> A ninja with this trick can strike at an opponent's vital pressure points, causing weakness and intense pain. Whenever the ninja deals sneak attack damage, she also deals 1 point of Strength or Dexterity damage, decided by the ninja. Unlike normal ability damage, this damage can be healed by a DC 15 Heal check. Each successful check heals 1 point of damage caused by this trick. A ninja with this trick receives a +10 insight bonus on this Heal check.</p><p><i>Rogue Talent:</i> The ninja can select a rogue talent in place of a ninja trick. The ninja cannot select a rogue talent that has the same name as a ninja trick. The ninja can select this talent multiple times.</p><p><i>Shadow Clone (Su):</i> The ninja can create 1d4 shadowy duplicates of herself that conceal her true location. This ability functions as mirror image, using the ninja's level as her caster level. Using this ability is a standard action that uses up 1 ki point.</p><p><i>Slow Metabolism (Ex):</i> The ninja has a slower-than-normal metabolism. She can hold her breath for twice as long as normal before needing to make Constitution checks (four times her Constitution score). In addition, whenever the ninja is poisoned, the time between saving throws (the poison's frequency) is doubled. Thus, a poison that has a frequency of \"1/round for 6 rounds\" would instead be \"1/2 rounds for 12 rounds.\"</p><p><i>Slow Reactions* (Ex):</i> Opponents that are damaged by the ninja's sneak attack can't make attacks of opportunity for 1 round.</p><p><i>Smoke Bomb (Ex):</i> This ability allows a ninja to throw a smoke bomb that creates a cloud of smoke with a 15-foot radius. This acts like the smoke from a smokestick. The ninja can center this smoke on herself, or throw the bomb as a ranged touch attack with a range of 20 feet. Using this ability is a standard action. Each use of this ability uses up 1 ki point.</p><p><i>Snatch Arrows:</i> A ninja who selects this ninja trick gains the Snatch Arrows feat as a bonus feat. The ninja must have the Improved Unarmed Strike feat and the Deflect Arrows feat before taking this trick.</p><p><i>Style Master:</i> A ninja who selects this ninja trick gains a style feat that she qualifies for as a bonus feat.</p><p><i>Sudden Disguise (Su):</i> As a swift action, a ninja can change her appearance for 1 minute per level. This ability functions as disguise self. Each use of this ability uses up 1 ki point.</p><p><i>Unarmed Combat Training:</i> A ninja who selects this ninja trick gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat.</p><p><i>Undetected Sabotage (Ex):</i> Whenever a ninja with this trick uses Disable Device to sabotage or disable a device, she can make a Stealth check with a bonus equal to her level. Anyone who inspects the device does not notice the sabotage and assumes the object works unless he beats the ninja's check with an opposed Perception skill check.</p><p><i>Vanishing Trick (Su):</i> As a swift action, the ninja can disappear for 1 round per level. This ability functions as invisibility. Using this ability uses up 1 ki point.</p><p><i>Ventriloquism (Su):</i> As a swift action, the ninja can throw her voice as if using the spell ventriloquism. She can use this ability for 1 minute per ninja level. Each use of this ability uses up 1 ki point.</p><p><i>Wall Climber (Su):</i> A ninja with this ability gains a climb speed of 20 feet, but only on vertical surfaces. This ability cannot be used to scale perfectly smooth surfaces or to climb on the underside of horizontal surfaces.</p><p><i>Weapon Training:</i> A ninja who selects this ninja trick gains Weapon Focus as a bonus feat.</p><p><b>No Trace (Ex):</b> At 3rd level, a ninja learns to cover her tracks, remain hidden, and conceal her presence. The DC to track a ninja using the Survival skill increases by +1. In addition, her training gives her a +1 insight bonus on Disguise skill checks and on opposed Stealth checks whenever she is stationary and does not take any action for at least 1 round. Every three levels thereafter, the increase to Survival DCs and the bonuses on Disguise and opposed Stealth checks increase by 1.</p><p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> Starting at 4th level, a ninja can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A ninja with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p><p>If a ninja already possesses uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead.</p><p><b>Light Steps (Ex):</b> At 6th level, a ninja learns to move while barely touching the surface underneath her. As a full-round action, she can move up to twice her speed, ignoring difficult terrain. While moving in this way, any surface will support her, no matter how much she weighs. This allows her to move across water, lava, or even the thinnest tree branches. She must end her move on a surface that can support her normally. She cannot move across air in this way, nor can she walk up walls or other vertical surfaces. When moving in this way, she does not take damage from surfaces or hazards that react to being touched, such as lava or caltrops, nor does she need to make Acrobatics checks to avoid falling on slippery or rough surfaces. Finally, when using light steps, the ninja ignores any mechanical traps that use a location-based trigger.</p><p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> At 8th level, a ninja can no longer be flanked. This defense denies another ninja (or rogue) the ability to sneak attack the ninja by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more ninja (or rogue) levels than the target does.</p><p>If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack when determining the minimum ninja (or rogue) level required to flank the character.</p><p><b>Master Tricks:</b> At 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a ninja can select one of the following master tricks in place of a ninja trick.</p><p><i>Advanced Talents:</i> The ninja can select a rogue talent from the list of Advanced Talents in place of a ninja trick. The ninja cannot select a rogue talent that has the same name as a ninja trick. The ninja cannot select improved evasion unless she has evasion (either as a class feature or as a ninja master trick).</p><p><i>Assassinate (Ex):</i> A ninja with this master trick can kill foes that are unable to defend themselves. To attempt to assassinate a target, the ninja must first study her target for 1 round as a standard action. On the following round, if the ninja makes a sneak attack against the target and the target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly killing the target. This attempt automatically fails if the target recognizes the ninja as an enemy. If the sneak attack is successful and the target of this attack fails a Fortitude save, it dies. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ninja's level + the ninja's Charisma modifier. If the save is successful, the target still takes the sneak attack damage as normal, but it is immune to that ninja's assassinate ability for 1 day.</p><p><i>Blinding Bomb (Ex):</i> Whenever the ninja throws a smoke bomb, all living creatures in the cloud must make a Fortitude save or be blinded by the black smoke for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ninja's level + the ninja's Charisma modifier. This trick cannot be combined with a choking bomb, but the ninja can combine a blinding bomb with a poison bomb. The ninja must have the choking bomb ninja trick before selecting this trick.</p><p><i>Deadly Shuriken (Ex):</i> As a full-round action, a ninja with this master trick can take careful aim and pool all of her attack potential into a single, deadly shuriken throw. When she does this, she throws a single shuriken at a single target, but makes as many attack rolls as she can, based on her base attack bonus. She makes the attack rolls in order from highest bonus to lowest, as if she were making a full attack. If any of the attack rolls hit the target, the attack hits. For each additional successful attack roll beyond the first, the ninja increases the damage by 1d6. Precision damage and extra damage from weapon special abilities (such as flaming) are added with damage modifiers and are not increased by this advanced talent. If one or more rolls are critical threats, she confirms the critical once using her highest base attack bonus -5. For each critical threat beyond the first, she reduces this penalty by 1 (to a maximum of 0).</p><p><i>Evasion (Ex):</i> A ninja can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ninja is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless ninja does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p><p><i>Feat:</i> A ninja may gain any feat that she qualifies for in place of a ninja trick.</p><p><i>Ghost Step (Su):</i> As a swift action, a ninja with this trick can pass through walls as if she were a ghost. Until the end of her turn, she can pass through a wall or other surface that is up to 5 feet thick per level as if she were incorporeal. She must exit the solid material by the end of her turn. Each use of this ability uses up 1 ki point.</p><p><i>Invisible Blade (Su):</i> Whenever a ninja uses the vanishing trick ninja trick, she is treated as if she were under the effects of greater invisibility. The ninja must have the vanishing trick ninja trick before selecting this ninja trick.</p><p><i>Master Disguise (Su):</i> A ninja with this trick can take on the appearance of other creatures and individuals. Whenever the ninja uses the sudden disguise ninja trick, the duration increases to 10 minutes per level. Alternatively, the ninja can use the sudden disguise ninja trick to take on the appearance of a specific individual that the ninja has seen before for 1 minute per level. Creatures that are familiar with the individual receive a Will saving throw to see through the illusion. The DC of this saving throw is 10 + 1/2 the ninja's level + the ninja's Charisma modifier. This illusion also changes the ninja's speech, if she has heard the individual talk and can speak his language. The ninja must have the sudden disguise ninja trick before selecting this trick.</p><p><i>See the Unseen (Su):</i> A ninja with this trick learns how to see that which cannot be seen. As a swift action, the ninja can cast see invisibility, using her level as the caster level. Each use of this ability uses up 1 ki point.</p><p><i>Shadow Split (Su):</i> This trick allows the ninja to create an illusory double of herself that moves away from her, allowing the ninja to create a distraction. When she uses this ability, an illusory double appears and moves away from the ninja, heading in one direction. The double climbs walls, jumps pits, or simply passes through obstacles, moving at twice the ninja's speed in the direction indicated by the ninja when the ability is used. Its course cannot be changed. The double persists for 1 round per level of the ninja. Those who interact with the double receive a Will saving throw to recognize that it is fake. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the ninja's level + the ninja's Charisma modifier. Each use of this ability uses up 1 ki point. The ninja must possess the shadow clone ninja trick before selecting this trick.</p><p><i>Unarmed Combat Mastery:</i> A ninja who selects this trick deals damage with her unarmed strikes as if she were a monk of her ninja level -4. If the ninja has levels in monk, this ability stacks with monk levels to determine how much damage she can do with her unarmed strikes. A ninja must have the Improved Unarmed Strike feat before taking this trick.</p><p><i>Unbound Steps (Su):</i> This trick allows a ninja to use her ki to walk through the air. Whenever the ninja uses the light steps class feature, she can walk on air, rising or descending as she desires. She must end her move on a solid surface. Each use of this ability uses up 1 ki point.</p><p><b>Hidden Master (Su): </b>At 20th level, a ninja becomes a true master of her art. She can, as a standard action, cast greater invisibility on herself. While invisible in this way, she cannot be detected by any means, and not even invisibility purge, see invisibility, and true seeing can reveal her. She uses her ninja level as her caster level for this ability. Using this ability consumes 3 ki points from her ki pool. In addition, whenever the ninja deals sneak attack damage, she can sacrifice additional damage dice to apply a penalty to one ability score of the target equal to the number of dice sacrificed for 1 minute. This penalty does not stack with itself and cannot reduce an ability score below 1.</p></text>\n            ","_id":"zx6UXYP2GlrAkC94"}
