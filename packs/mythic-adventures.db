Such a champion can attain it only though a perilous quest that tests mettle and righteousness. Rather than being a physical object, the Nimbus of Radiant Truth manifests as a glowing halo of light around the wearer's head. It's ordinarily as bright as continual flame, but in battle it brightens to the dazzling brilliance of daylight. Its radiance is treated as resulting from a 9th-level spell for purposes of interaction with other sources of light and darkness. The radiance of the nimbus can be suppressed or resumed as a standard action.</p>\n<p>The Nimbus of Radiant Truth grants a +6 enhancement bonus to Wisdom and Charisma. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the nimbus is worn. Its wearer can't deliberately utter a lie, though the nimbus doesn't prevent other forms of deception, evasiveness, and giving incomplete answers within the boundaries of the truth. All of the wearer's natural weapons and any weapons she wields overcome damage reduction as though they were good-aligned. In addition, the Nimbus of Radiant Truth has the following powers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The wearer can bring forth a zone of truth (DC 20) with a 40-foot radius at will. By expending one use of mythic power, the DC increases to 30.</li>\n<li>As an immediate action, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to gain the benefits of freedom's call (as the Liberation domain power) or nimbus of light (as the Sun domain power) for 2 minutes. For purposes of this power, the wearer has a cleric level equal to her character level. Either power can be dismissed as a free action, but any unused duration is lost.</li>\n<li>Seven times per day, the wearer can cure moderate wounds as a cleric with a caster level equal to her character level. The wearer adds her mythic tier to the hit points healed.</li>\n<li>Three times per day, the wearer can unleash a holy aura (DC 25) or an empowered holy smite (DC 22).</li>\n<li>Once per day, the wearer can unleash a blast of righteous power. Treat this as sunburst (DC 27) centered on the wearer, except that it has no effect on good-aligned creatures and inflicts double damage to evil-aligned creatures. After this power is used, the nimbus fades to a barely visible glow for 1 hour, and the wearer loses access to all of its powers save its enhancement bonuses. She remains unable to lie.</li>\n<li>Once per week, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to perform a resurrection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The wearer of the Nimbus of Radiant Truth can remove it as though it were a physical item, and place it either on the head of another creature or on an inanimate object. When placed on an inanimate object, the Nimbus of Radiant Truth can be picked up. When placed on a living creature, it can't be removed except by the wearer's conscious choice.</p>\n<p>When donned by a creature of evil alignment, the nimbus blasts the creature for 20d6 points of damage, then teleports 1d10&times;10 miles away in a random direction. However, if the wearer becomes evil some time after donning it, the nimbus retains its powers and doesn't damage the wearer. The nimbus cannot be deceived by any mortal means of masking alignment (including mythic abilities).</p>\n<h1>Destruction</h1>\n<p>The Nimbus of Radiant Truth can be destroyed by placing it on the head of a person who was once completely good and innocent, but is now corrupted into the vilest depths of evil and depravity.</p>"}

You can also expend one use of mythic power when casting an arcane spell to increase its damage by 50%. If the spell has a duration greater than 1 round, the duration doubles. Any saves required by the spell take a -4 penalty, although for mythic creatures, this penalty is reduced to -2. This spell ignores any spell resistance the targets have, although targets immune to the spell or to magic still retain that protection.</p>\n<p><strong>Divine Knowledge (Ex):</strong> You can use arcane power to cast a small number of divine spells. Choose three 1st-level spells from the cleric spell list or three 1st-level spells from the druid spell list. You can add those spells to your spellbook (if you're a magus or wizard) or familiar (if you're a witch) for free and can cast those spells as if they were arcane spells on your class list. You can select this ability up to three times. Each time you select it, you choose three more spells from the same class's spell list (cleric or druid), and the highest spell level you can select from increases by 1 (up to 2nd level the second time and up to 3rd level the third time). You must be a magus, witch, or wizard to select this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Eldritch Reciprocation (Su):</strong> You can choose to take extra damage from an arcane spell to replenish mythic power. When you are hit by or fail a saving throw against an arcane spell that deals hit point damage, as an immediate action you can choose to take damage as if that spell were affected by the Maximize Spell feat. If the spell's damage can't be increased by the Maximize Spell feat or is already under the effect of the Maximize Spell feat, you instead take double damage from it. The spell's damage ignores your spell resistance, energy resistance, energy immunities, and other protections against damage. If you take at least 25 points of damage from the spell, you regain one use of mythic power.</p>\n<p><strong>Sanctum (Su):</strong> You gain access to your own personal extradimensional sanctum. By concentrating for 1 minute without interruption, you conjure the door to your own personal sanctum, similar to mage's magnificent mansion, but with the following differences. The sanctum takes up a space equal to six 20-foot cubes per tier, shapeable when you first create it as if it were a spell whose area or effect is shapeable. The sanctum is permanent and persistent, so you can store objects within the sanctum and retrieve them on future visits. The sanctum includes one unseen servant per tier. When you conjure the sanctum's door, you decide which creatures can see and use it (to all other creatures it's invisible and impermeable). The door remains until you dismiss it - a standard action with unlimited range as long as you are on the same plane as the door. If you dismiss the door while you are outside the sanctum, all creatures other than your familiar are immediately shunted outside. Conjuring the door automatically dismisses any other active door. As a full-round action, your familiar can enter or leave the sanctum from any square adjacent to you, without using the conjured door.</p>\n<p>Special Abilities</p>"}

In addition, whenever the minotaur must make a saving throw while inside its lair, it can roll twice and take the higher result. A mythic minotaur can change its lair once per week.

Some mythic minotaurs are worshiped as demigods by primitive or fear-stricken humanoids, and accept sacrifices of young men and women to sate their hunger. They usually have custom armor and weapons appropriate for their large, inhuman frames, offered as gifts by worshipers or made by enslaved blacksmiths.</p></text>\n            "}

Initially this knowledge consists of facts about population size, local economy, agriculture, leaders, and popular deities worshiped in the area.</p>\n<p>The owner feels a powerful desire to continue watching, and if she does so while taking no other breaks except to eat and sleep, the information continues unabated. Over the course of 1d10 days, the heart reveals much more: the subtle social, religious, and economic influences of the settlement; the strengths and weaknesses of its leaders; and all the many secrets both pedestrian and profane that could be used to manipulate and extort those with power over the location. At this point, the heart begins to communicate to its new owner, suggesting courses of action that would bring her a higher social station, wealth, and power in that area. The heart's advice is almost always sound, but also always driven toward an unfortunate and evil outcome for someone - just not necessarily its owner. If the owner refuses to heed its advice, eventually the heart vanishes, seeking a more pliant puppet to manipulate.</p>\n<p>Legends suggest that those who never question the heart's orders or decline its gift of knowledge eventually disappear to whatever cold place from which the heart originated.</p>\n<h1>Destruction</h1>\n<p>The heart must be carried to the plane of Elysium and submerged for a day in the warm waters in the settlements of the azata. Once melted, a willing kiss from a brijidineB2 upon the now beating heart causes it to burst and turn to dust.</p>"}

As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power and touch a willing creature to copy one of that creature's class features. You gain the use of this class feature for 10 minutes per tier, using the level of the creature touched as your level for any effects based on level. You can't copy an ability that has a limited number of uses per day (such as rage, smite evil, or spellcasting) or an ability that involves a companion (such as eidolon, hunter's bond, or nature bond). You can have only one use of this ability in effect at one time. If you use this ability again, any previous use immediately ends. You can't copy the same ability more than once per day.</p>\n<p><strong>Enduring Elixir (Su):</strong> Whenever you drink an elixir, extract, or potion with a duration of 10 minutes per level or longer, you can change its duration to 1 day. You can have this ability in effect on only one elixir, extract, or potion at a time. Using it on a second one causes the duration of the first to revert to normal - and to end immediately if the normal duration would have expired. If you're at least 9th tier, you can select this ability a second time to have it work on extracts and potions with a duration of 1 minute or longer.</p>\n<p><strong>Precision Critical (Ex):</strong> Whenever you score a critical hit, double any extra precision damage dice, such as sneak attack damage. These dice are only doubled, not multiplied by the weapon's critical modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Slayer's Cyclone (Ex):</strong> When you spot a breach in an enemy's defenses, you make attacks with a lethal blend of speed and precision. As a full-round action, you can make a single melee attack at your highest base attack bonus. If you hit and the target is flat-footed, deal damage as normal. You can then move and make another attack. You may continue this process until you miss, attack an opponent that isn't flat-footed, or attack an opponent you already hit this round. You can't move more than double your speed in this way in 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Steal Power (Su):</strong> By attempting a melee touch attack as a standard action, you can try to steal mythic power from another creature. The target must have at least one use of mythic power available. If the attack hits, attempt an opposed d20 roll against the target, adding your tier. If your total exceeds that of the target, the target loses one use of mythic power and you gain one use. You can use this ability on a given creature only once per day.</p>\n<p><strong>Unending Performance (Su):</strong> You can imbue an ally with power that lingers for a full day. Whenever you use a spell, bardic performance, or another class feature to grant a morale or competence bonus, you can designate any one creature affected by this bonus. The designated creature keeps this bonus for up to 24 hours. You can have only one creature designated in this way at a time. If you designate a new creature, the bonus immediately ends for the previous target. The creature you designate must be one of the targets when you cast the spell, start the performance, or use the class feature.</p>\n<p>Special Abilities</p>"}

The world's reaction to such heroes is also a significant part of making a campaign actually feel mythic. The Npcs encountered in a mythic game should have a sense - possibly vague, possibly unmistakable - that the PCs are marked with grandeur.</p>\n<p>When portraying the PCs' mythic origins and powers, the GM has a few options. The mythic nature could be apparent to everyone in some visible way, like a glowing brand or faint aura. This could be always visible, or manifest only as a character uses mythic power. Alternatively its nature could be subtle and felt rather than seen. Of course, it could start as something subtle at lower tiers, and become more pronounced as a mythic character progresses. Regardless of what direction you take, the people in the world should not mistake mythic characters for normal people.</p>\n<p>The way that common people talk to these heroes needs to be different from the way they would talk to other characters. Mythic PCs should never be \"tasked\" or \"ordered\" to do anything (except perhaps by a demanding foe in a momentary position of power). Beings, even rulers or powerful planar allies, should address the mythic characters as peers or possibly entreat them as supplicants.</p>\n<p>Likewise, when Npcs are in the presence of such greatness, they should not waste time asking for trivial favors. That's what normal low-level adventurers are for. Even a 1st-level/1st-tier character is worthy of respect. That doesn't mean you have to throw away the quests you've planned, but you should present them to the PCs (and players) as something worth a mythic character's time and energy.</p>\n<p>The true powers in the world, whether the raw power of angels and demons or the political power of kingdoms and churches, recognize the potential in the mythic heroes.</p>\n<p>Wise ones know to be polite to low-tier heroes today, because in the future they will be formidable allies or devastating foes.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, mythic power is an alienating force. Very few people have it, and many of those who do are threats, not friends. So the people the heroes encounter will look at them with reverence, fear, or even resentment, but never with familiarity and ease. In some ways, mythic characters are the ultimate outsiders, saving a world that they don't quite fit in anymore.</p>"}

You can become a member of any class, even one with an alignment requirement, and can never lose your membership because of a change in alignment. If you violate the code of ethics of any of your classes, you might still lose access to certain features of such classes, subject to GM discretion. Attempts to detect your alignment don't return any results. If a class restricts you from casting spells with an alignment descriptor, you can cast such spells without restrictions or repercussions. If you're the target of a spell or effect that is based on alignment, you're treated as the most favorable alignment when determining the spell's effect on you. Any effects that alter alignment have no effect on you. If you lose this effect, you revert to your previous alignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Divine Source (Su):</strong> You can grant divine spells to those who follow your cause, allowing them to select you as their deity for the purposes of determining their spells and domains. Select two domains upon taking this ability. These domains must be alignment domains matching your alignment if possible, unless your alignment is neutral. You grant access to these domains as if you were a deity. Creatures that gain spells from you don't receive any spells per day of levels higher than your tier; they lose those spell slots. In addition, you can cast spells from domains you grant as long as their level is equal to or less than your tier. Each day as a spell-like ability, you can cast one spell of each level equal to or less than your tier (selecting from those available to you from your divine source domains). If you're a cleric or you venerate a deity, you may change your spell domains to those you grant others. At 6th tier and 9th tier, you can select this ability again, adding one domain and two subdomains (see the Advanced Player's Guide) to your list each time and adding their spells to the list of those that you can cast.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Ability (Ex):</strong> You gain a permanent +2 bonus to one ability score of your choice. You can select this path ability up to six times. Each time you do, it must apply to a different ability score.</p>\n<p><strong>Fearless (Su):</strong> Few things in the world still inspire fear in you. You are immune to all fear effects from non-mythic sources. Fear effects from mythic sources count as mythic for the purposes of this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Pure Body (Su):</strong> Your body is so pure that you're immune to all non-mythic diseases and poisons. Diseases and poisons from mythic sources count as mythic for the purposes of this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Pure Destiny (Su):</strong> Your mythic destiny is guided by providence. You're immune to all non-mythic curses and compulsions. Curses and compulsions from mythic sources count as mythic for the purposes of this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Pure Senses (Su):</strong> Your senses are extraordinarily keen. You're immune to blindness and deafness caused by non-mythic sources. Such effects from mythic sources count as mythic for the purposes of this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Sleepless (Su):</strong> You no longer require sleep, don't become fatigued or exhausted from lack of sleep, and are immune to sleep effects. If you have abilities or class features that require rest before they can be regained, you can choose to regain them once per day by spending 1 hour in uninterrupted meditation.</p>\n<p><strong>Ultimate Versatility (Ex):</strong> Once per day, you can temporarily change one decision made for one of your class features. This change lasts for a number of minutes equal to your tier. During this time, you're treated as if you had always had the new class feature. For example, you could use this ability to change the decision made with the arcane bond class feature, causing your bonded item to disappear (along with all of its bonuses and restrictions) and a familiar to appear in its place. This doesn't affect any prepared spells or spells you have already cast. If the new ability is limited in its uses per day, you receive half the normal number of uses (minimum 1). When this ability ends, your previous choice returns with the same number of uses as before you used this ability. If you use this ability to change a class feature that grants access to spells (such as a bloodline, patron, domain, or school), you lose access to any spells from the old choice but don't gain the ability to cast new spells. When the effect ends, the previous spells return and can be cast again. You can use this ability to change a feat or skill if you receive it from a class feature, but any other abilities that rely on the missing feat or skill as a prerequisite don't function while this ability is in effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Unchanging (Su):</strong> Your form is so stable that you become immune to non-mythic polymorph and petrification effects. Polymorph and petrification from mythic sources count as mythic for the purposes of this ability.</p>\n<p>Special Abilities</p>"}

For example, if you are 4th tier and wearing +2 breastplate, you treat the armor's +6 armor bonus as +8 (50% of +6 is +3, limited to +2 by half your tier).</p>\n<p><strong>Avenging Maneuver (Ex):</strong> Taking grievous wounds only empowers you. Any creature that confirms a critical hit with a melee attack against you provokes an attack of opportunity from you. You can use this attack of opportunity only to attempt a bull rush, disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuver check. You don't provoke attacks of opportunity for attempting this combat maneuver check.</p>\n<p><strong>Borrow Elements (Su):</strong> When you take acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, you store some of this energy within yourself and can direct it outward through your attacks. Whenever you take energy damage, you gain an amount of energy of that type equal to 1/2 the damage taken (after any resistances or immunities are applied). Whenever you hit with a melee attack, you may expend 5 points from the pool of one energy type to have the attack deal an additional 1d6 points of energy damage of that type. As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to release all stored energy of one type as a ray with a 60-foot range. The ray deals 1d6 points of energy damage for every 5 points of energy stored. If unused, the stored energy harmlessly dissipates 1 minute after the last time you took energy damage of any type.</p>\n<p><strong>Burst Through (Ex):</strong> Whenever you charge, you can move through squares containing allies and opponents almost as if they were not obstructing your charge. You can move through squares containing allies freely, but you must succeed at an overrun combat maneuver check for each opponent that obstructs your path to the target of your charge. If the result of the check exceeds the opponent's Cmd, you may move through the opponent's square and continue toward the target without provoking an attack of opportunity from that opponent. If you fail any of these combat maneuver checks, your movement ends in the square before that opponent, but you may resolve the charge attack against the foe that stopped you.</p>\n<p><strong>Draw Fire (Su):</strong> As an immediate action, when an ally within 30 feet is targeted with a ranged weapon attack, you can have that attack target you instead. If you would normally be out of range for that attack, the attack is able to hit you as if you were at maximum range. You can use this ability without using an immediate action by expending one use of mythic power.</p>\n<p><strong>Empathic Healing (Su):</strong> You can expend one use of mythic power to transfer up to 10 points of damage per tier from a touched ally to yourself, healing the target and damaging you. This transferred damage bypasses all effects that reduce or negate hit point damage (such as damage reduction). Alternatively, you can expend two uses of mythic power to transfer an ongoing disease or poison from a touched ally to yourself, which halts ongoing effects on the target from that affliction and requires you to attempt any remaining saves against it. If you're immune to the disease or poison, transferring it to yourself destroys the affliction.</p>\n<p><strong>Ever Ready (Ex):</strong> Whenever you make an attack of opportunity, you gain a bonus on the attack and damage rolls equal to your mythic tier. You can make attacks of opportunity while flat-footed, even if you don't have the Combat Reflexes feat. At 3rd, 6th, and 9th tier, the number of attacks of opportunity you can make each round increases by one.</p>\n<p><strong>Fast Healing (Ex):</strong> As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to gain fast healing 5 for 1 minute. This ability can be taken a second time at 3rd tier or higher and a third time at 6th tier or higher. Each additional time you take this ability, the fast healing increases by 5.</p>\n<p><strong>Guardian's Shout (Ex):</strong> Your warning shouts keep allies from danger. Whenever you attempt a Reflex save to avoid an effect that affects multiple creatures, you can expend one use of your mythic power to call out a warning to your allies. Any allies within 100 feet who can hear you gain a bonus equal to your tier on their saving throws against that effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Immovable (Su):</strong> Add your tier to your Cmd whenever an enemy attempts a bull rush, drag, reposition, or trip combat maneuver check against you. If the check is successful, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to cause it to fail instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Imprinting Hand (Su):</strong> By touching a foe, you can gain knowledge about it, including its weaknesses. To use this ability, you must first successfully hit a foe with an unarmed strike, natural weapon, or melee touch attack to make contact, then use this ability is a free action. As long as the target remains within 1 mile of you, you always know the direction and approximate distance to it. If the foe has any weaknesses or vulnerabilities (including a mythic flaw), you immediately know this information. You can maintain this connection with only one creature at a time; if you use this ability on another creature, your connection with the previous creature is lost.</p>\n<p><strong>Knowledgeable Guardian (Su):</strong> Add double your tier as a bonus on Knowledge checks you attempt to identify monsters, including checks made to learn any special powers and vulnerabilities. As a free action, you can expend one use of mythic power to telepathically communicate the knowledge you obtain from this check to all allies within 100 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Lesson Learned (Ex):</strong> You adapt quickly to the perils presented in battle. Whenever you fail a saving throw against a supernatural or spell-like ability, you gain a +5 bonus on all further saving throws against that ability, including subsequent saves against an ongoing effect, or against the same effect produced by a different source or creature. This bonus lasts for a number of minutes equal to your tier. For example, if you fail a save against a demon's fireball spell-like ability, you gain this bonus against a fireball spell-like ability from any creature; if you fail a save against a blue dragon's electricity breath weapon, you gain this bonus against all blue dragon electricity breath weapons, but not against a black dragon's acid breath weapon or a gorgon's petrification breath weapon. If you fail another saving throw against the same ability, the duration of lesson learned resets but the bonus doesn't stack with itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Companion (Su):</strong> Select one animal companion, cohort, eidolon, familiar, or bonded mount. That creature can use the surge ability a number of times per day equal to your tier. Its surge ability uses the same bonus die type as you do when you use your surge ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Mercy (Su):</strong> When you use the mercy paladin class feature, your caster level check to remove curses, diseases, and poisons automatically succeeds unless the affliction is from a mythic source. If you expend one use of mythic power when using a mercy, you add break enchantment to its effect, using your paladin level as your caster level. You must have the mercy class feature to select this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Pack Wild Shape (Su):</strong> When you use the wild shape class feature, you can also transform allies when you change shape. When you use wild shape, you can expend one use of mythic power to select a number of willing allies equal to your tier. These allies take the same animal form as you do, with the same abilities as yours. Divide the duration of that use of wild shape evenly (rounded down) among yourself and the affected allies. The transformation ends for everyone when you return to your normal form or use wild shape again. An ally can end its own transformation early as a standard action without affecting the duration for you or other allies. You must have the wild shape class feature to select this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Partial Transformation (Su):</strong> You have refined control over your transformation ability. When using wild shape, you can expend one use of mythic power to only partially transform into or out of animal form. For example, you could transform your hands into tiger claws and your head into a tiger's head (giving you low-light vision and scent, and allowing you to make claw and bite attacks but still wear armor and use worn magic items normally), transform into a deinonychus with human hands (allowing you to still manipulate objects and wear rings), or transform into a constrictor snake with a humanoid head (allowing you to speak and cast spells with verbal components). You may make one such change per round as a free action for the duration of that use of wild shape. For example, if you change into a tiger, this ability allows you to partially transform yourself from tiger form to your normal form and back as needed until the duration ends or you fully return to your normal form. You must have the wild shape class feature to select this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick Recovery (Ex):</strong> Whenever you are dazed, dazzled, deafened, sickened, or stunned, reduce the duration of that condition by half (minimum 1 round). Any other effects relating to the source of that condition are unaffected; for example, if you are panicked and sickened from an eyebite spell, the panicked effect has the normal duration even though you are sickened for only half as long. You can select this ability twice. The second time you select it, you also reduce the duration of the blinded, nauseated, and paralyzed conditions by half.</p>\n<p><strong>Raise Animal (Su):</strong> By burying the corpse of a dead animal (at least its bones) and expending one use of mythic power, you raise it from the dead overnight. You can use this ability on an animal companion, familiar, or bonded mount even if it is not a creature of the animal type. At 1st tier, this functions like raise dead. At 3rd tier, this functions like resurrection. At 6th tier, this functions like true resurrection.</p>\n<p><strong>Ranged Disarm (Ex):</strong> You can use a ranged attack to disarm an opponent. Attempt a disarm combat maneuver check using your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier, and add your tier to the roll. Using this ability doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. If your attack is successful, your target drops one item of your choice that it is carrying, even if the item is wielded with two hands. If your attack exceeds the Cmd of the target by 10 or more, the target drops the items it is carrying in both hands (maximum two items if the target has more than two hands). Unlike with a melee disarm, failing the attack by 10 or more doesn't make you drop your weapon, and you can't automatically pick up the item dropped.</p>\n<p><strong>Relentless Healing (Su):</strong> You can restore life to the recently dead. If a creature has died within 1 round, as a free action you can expend one use of mythic power when casting a healing spell or using a class feature that heals damage to apply that healing to the dead creature. If this healing brings the creature's hit points above the threshold for death, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total (similar to the way breath of life functions); otherwise, it remains dead. Alternatively, you can expend two uses of mythic power on a dead creature that would have the ability to magically heal itself if it were alive (such as a dead cleric with a prepared cure light wounds spell) in order to trigger the most powerful healing magic it knows or has prepared. If this brings the creature's hit points above its death threshold, it returns to life.</p>\n<p><strong>Retributive Reach (Ex):</strong> Treat your reach as 5 feet greater than normal for the purpose of determining whether or not you can make an attack of opportunity. If a creature provokes an attack of opportunity within this area of increased reach, you can expend one use of mythic power to gain a bonus equal to your tier on the attack roll and damage roll of the attack of opportunity.</p>\n<p><strong>Sacrificial Shield (Ex):</strong> Once per round when you would normally be hit by a weapon attack, you can use your shield to block the attack. You must be using a shield in order to use this ability. Subtract your shield's hardness and hit points (see Table 7-12 on page 175 of the Core Rulebook) from the damage of the attack and apply the remaining damage to your hit points. If the shield takes enough damage to destroy it, it's destroyed. Otherwise, it gains the broken condition, even if the damage was not enough to give it the broken condition under other circumstances. You can expend one use of mythic power when using this ability to negate any damage dealt to the shield, though you still take any damage that exceeds its hardness and hit points. You can choose to negate the damage after the damage is rolled.</p>\n<p><strong>Supreme Tracker (Su):</strong> If you have something that carries a creature's scent (such as a personal item or piece of flesh), you can expend one use of mythic power to create a supernatural bond that allows you track that individual. As a free action, you can sense the creature's general direction and distance, as well as know whether it is alive, dead, destroyed, dying, or undead. The creature must be on the same plane as you for this ability to function. For the purpose of spells and effects that block scrying and divination, your caster level for this effect is a number equal to double your tier. At 6th tier, you can track the creature if it's on a different plane than you.</p>\n<p>Special Abilities</p>"}

Though non-mythic creatures can board the ship as passengers, the Silver Maiden requires a mythic creature to be its captain. If the ship currently has no captain, a mythic character can claim the captaincy by touching the ship's wheel and stating her desire to be captain. The captain then serves until death or voluntarily retirement. Upon assuming the captaincy, the captain becomes aware of all of the ship's powers, and can propel the ship completely unaided from anywhere aboard the vessel, whether sailing the high seas of a terrestrial world or gliding through the vast blackness of deep space.</p>\n<p>At will, the captain can expend two uses of mythic power to launch the Silver Maiden into outer space. Once in space, the ship can sail through the vacuum at incredible speeds. Although exact travel times vary, a voyage between two planets within a solar system takes 2d20 days, and a voyage to another star system takes 2d20 weeks (or more at the GM's discretion). The captain must know which world she wishes to travel to (as if the captain cast greater teleport). When the ship arrives at its destination, it slowly descends to the surface (as the feather fall spell), and typically lands in a body of water. Once earthbound, the ship moves as a standard sailing ship. If the planet has no water or comparable liquid, the ship lands on solid ground and is unable to move until the captain once again launches the ship back into space.</p>\n<p>The Silver Maiden can also sail the Outer Planes. At will, the captain can expend three uses of mythic power to transport the ship to another plane, as the plane shift spell. When the ship arrives at its extraplanar destination, it appears in a body of water or comparable liquid, 1 to 100 miles from the captain's intended destination. If the plane has no water (such as the Plane of Earth) the ship appears on solid ground, and is unable to move until the captain transports it to another plane. If the plane has neither water nor a solid surface, such as the Plane of Air, the ship continues to slowly fall (as the feather fall spell) until the captain transports it to another plane.</p>\n<p>The Silver Maiden protects its passengers from the environmental dangers of deep space and the outer planes, and can even sail the molten surface of a star. At all times, the ship simulates a comfortable temperature and gravity normal for its current captain's home world. This protection extends 10 feet from the exterior of the vessel.</p>\n<h1>Destruction</h1>\n<p>The Silver Maiden can be destroyed if its captain sails it into a black hole.</p>"}

During play, the PCs will face a variety of challenges: monsters, Npcs, traps, and more. The difference is that during a mythic adventure, the challenges are far deadlier. It's important to stress to the players, through the encounters that they face, that these are dangers beyond what they might normally expect in the game. Much of this comes through the design of the encounters, which can vary greatly depending on the PCs and how you want to challenge them. In the most basic terms, the mythic rules can be used in one of two ways: to challenge normal PCs and to challenge mythic PCs.</p>\n<p><strong>Encounters for Normal PCs:</strong> If the PCs aren't mythic, then these rules can be used to present challenges of an unexpected nature. Mythic creatures and villains are more powerful than their normal counterparts, making encounters significantly more dangerous. See the Adjusting CR and Level sidebar.</p>\n<p>Normal PCs should be rewarded with experience points and treasure based on this adjusted CR. This means the PCs will face creatures that would normally be below them in terms of their original CRs, but whose strange abilities make them true threats. Such encounters should generally be at least challenging in relation to the PCs' Average Party Level (Apl; see Table 12-1 on page 397 of the Core Rulebook).</p>\n<p>For example, a group of four 6th-level PCs is exploring an ancient crypt filled with undead. As they face a variety of normal undead foes, they also begin to discover a far greater evil dwelling within, sealed away centuries ago by a holy brotherhood. Upon breaching the final chamber, they face a pair of mythic mummies crackling with dark magic. The pair of mythic mummies has an adjusted CR of 8, making it a deadly threat to the 6th-level PCs.</p>\n<p><strong>Encounters for Mythic PCs:</strong> Mythic adventurers are ready for challenges beyond those normally expected for characters of their level. (See the Adjusting CR and Level sidebar.) When designing encounters to challenge these characters, roughly one-third of the encounters should use their adjusted Apl, one-third should use the characters' original Apl, and the remaining should fall somewhere between those two values.</p>\n<p>Of course, individual encounters can vary from these numbers as normal (such as a challenging encounter versus an easy encounter, as noted on Table 12-1 on page 397 of the Core Rulebook). When facing a mythic foe, add half its mythic rank to its original CR to determine the foe's adjusted CR (as above).</p>\n<p>For example, when designing challenges for a group of four 12th-level, 6th-tier mythic PCs, approximately one-third of the encounters they face should be CR 12, one-third should be CR 15, and the remaining encounters should be CR 13 or 14. That means some of their encounters are rather easy (allowing them to dominate foes using their mythic power), some are of average difficulty, and some truly push them to their limits. The challenging encounters should be against other mythic foes, forcing the PCs to confront enemies with similar power.</p>"}

These terms are worth reviewing before continuing on with the rest of this book.</p>\n<p><strong>Ascension:</strong> The moment of ascension is the moment when a normal character becomes a mythic character. This event is usually a critical moment in the story that helps to define the mythic character's origin and the source of her power. Once a character has undergone ascension, she gains her first mythic tier and can select a mythic path. (See page 10 in Chapter 1.)</p>\n<p><strong>Boon:</strong> When a mythic character completes a particularly difficult task, the GM might reward that character with a boon. A boon represents having earned the favor of the source of the character's power. Once acquired, a boon allows the character to draw upon mythic power one additional time that day. A mythic character might be rewarded with a boon several times in a single session, but no more than once per encounter. (See page 132 in Chapter 4.)</p>\n<p><strong>DR/Epic:</strong> A type of damage reduction, DR/epic can be overcome only by a weapon with an enhancement bonus of +6 or greater (Pathfinder Rpg Bestiary 299). Weapons with special abilities also count as epic for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction if the total bonus value of all of their abilities (including the enhancement bonus) is +6 or greater.</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic:</strong> With abilities seemingly beyond the those of ordinary mortals, a mythic character or mythic monster becomes part of a story that plays out on a greater scale than ordinary people can understand. An attack, spell, or other effect is considered mythic if it originates from a mythic source, such as a character or creature with a mythic tier or rank. (See the sidebar on page 5.)</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Path:</strong> (Often referred to just as a \"path.\") The theme of a character's mythic abilities is determined by her mythic path - archmage, champion, guardian, hierophant, marshal, or trickster. Each path has a number of special abilities associated with it that the character can select as she advances in tier. (See page 11 in Chapter 1.)</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Power:</strong> Each mythic character can call upon this base mythic ability to influence destiny and fuel other abilities. At its most basic, mythic power is needed to use the surge ability, but it can also be called upon to use a number of other mythic abilities. (See page 12 in Chapter 1.)</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Rank:</strong> (Often referred to just as a \"rank.\") Similar to tiers, mythic ranks are used to describe the approximate mythic power possessed by a monster. All creatures with a mythic rank are considered mythic for the purposes of feats, spells, magic items, and other abilities. Mythic ranks range from 1 to 10. (See page 176 in Chapter 6.)</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Tier:</strong> (Often referred to just as a \"tier.\") Mythic characters advance in power by gaining tiers, each of which grants new abilities. Attaining a new mythic tier requires completing difficult trials within the campaign's story rather than accumulating experience points. Mythic tiers range from 1 to 10. Characters who achieve 10th tier are at the height of mythic power, and are in some respects akin to minor deities. (See page 13 in Chapter 1.)</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Trial:</strong> (Often referred to just as a \"trial.\") A trial is a difficult task that awaits mythic heroes. It usually represents the culmination of part of the heroes' story, marking it as an important point in their legend. A mythic character has to complete one or more trials in order to reach a new mythic tier. Trials and mythic path advancement are separate from XP and character level advancement, and are based on grand achievements within the story rather than individual encounters. (See page 13 in Chapter 1 and page 129 in Chapter 4.)</p>\n<p><strong>Non-Mythic:</strong> Any attack, spell, or effect originating from a character or creature without any mythic abilities is non-mythic. This term can also refer to a character without a mythic tier or a creature without a mythic rank. (See the sidebar on page 5.)</p>\n<p><strong>Surge:</strong> Surge is a basic ability that each mythic character receives. It allows her to roll a die and add the result to a d20 roll, influencing the outcome after the results are revealed. (See page 12 in Chapter 1.)</p>"}

This ability can be selected twice. The second time it is selected, it also applies to mythic creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Fistful of Daggers (Ex):</strong> When you could make a full attack with thrown weapons, you can instead make a single attack roll at your highest attack bonus and apply the result to any number of creatures in a 30-foot cone. Roll damage once and deal it to all creatures hit by the attack. This attack can't deal precision damage. You must throw one weapon at each target. Use the bonuses to attack and damage from the least powerful weapon thrown (for example, if you have one +2 dagger and 20 masterwork daggers, the attacks are treated as masterwork daggers). Apply any effects of concealment for individual targets as normal. If the attack roll is a critical threat, choose one target you hit and attempt to confirm the critical against that target.</p>\n<p><strong>Perfect Strike (Ex):</strong> You can expend one use of mythic power as a standard action to deliver a perfect strike. A perfect strike attack is made using your full base attack bonus. If the attack hits, it deals double the normal amount of damage, and this damage bypasses all damage reduction and hardness. If the perfect strike is a critical hit, increase the critical multiplier for the attack by 1 (so a &times;2 weapon deals &times;3 damage). Damage that isn't multiplied on a critical hit isn't multiplied on a perfect strike.

You must succeed at a melee touch attack against the creature or effect and expend one use of mythic power. If this attack hits, the creature or effect is subject to targeted greater dispel magic, using double your tier as your caster level. If you dispel an effect, you suffer no harmful effects from touching it. If the effect is on a creature, the creature takes 1 point of damage per spell level of each effect dispelled.</p>\n<p><strong>Sweeping Strike (Su):</strong> Even when you're swarmed, your foes are not safe from danger. Whenever you could make a full attack, you may instead make a single attack at your highest attack bonus and apply the results to all opponents within your reach. Roll damage once and apply it to all opponents hit by the attack. This attack can't deal precision damage. If the attack roll is a critical threat, choose one target you hit and attempt to confirm the critical against that target.</p>\n<p>Special Abilities</p>"}

Still, vestiges of the civilization remain.

These antagonists could be athachs, hill giants, or lamia. They roam in packs on the lower mountain reaches, attacking intruders on sight, and craft pit traps and falling-rock traps. The upper reaches of the mountains are home to giant eagles, mythic leucrottas, mythic rocs, and yrthaks.</p>\n<p>The peak of each mountain holds a different challenge. One peak holds the lair of a mythic crag linnorm. Among its treasure is a golden crown of the ancient civilization. A second peak holds a deep cavern, where a fearsome mythic neothelid dwells. Its treasure includes a heavy tome written in an ancient language containing the collected wisdom of long-ago rulers who lived through difficult challenges and recorded their thoughts and decisions. When the heroes descend from the second peak, they may encounter the bulk of the valley's inhabitants, led by a ferocious barbarian with guardian tiers.

When a spell's name begins with \"lesser,\" \"greater,\" or \"mass,\" the spell is alphabetized under the second word of the spell name instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> The term \"Hit Dice\" is used synonymously with \"character levels\" for effects that affect a specific number of Hit Dice of creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level:</strong> A spell's power often depends on caster level, which is defined as the caster's class level for the purpose of casting a particular spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Creatures and Characters:</strong> \"Creature\" and \"character\" are used synonymously in the spell descriptions.</p>\n<p><strong>New Spells:</strong> An asterisk (*) after a spell name indicates a new spell presented in this chapter, starting on page 113.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented Mythic Spells:</strong> A superscript \"A\" appearing at the end of a spell's name in these lists indicates the spell has an augmented effect (see page 80) when the caster expends additional uses of mythic power. See the individual spell descriptions for information on the augmented effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ablative Barrier</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Combat</p>\n<p>Add half your tier to the spell's armor bonus. Add half your tier to the amount of lethal damage from each attack that is converted to nonlethal damage and to the DR against nonlethal damage. Add half your tier to your caster level when determining how much damage the spell converts before it's discharged.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Animal Aspect</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Combat</p>\n<p>You gain low-light vision, a +2 size bonus to the physical ability score of your choice, and a +1 enhancement bonus to your natural armor. Alternatively, you may cast the non-mythic form of this spell on a touched willing creature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Animate Dead</h2>\n<p>Add your tier to your caster level when determining how many Hit Dice of undead you can animate with a single casting of this spell. This doesn't increase the total number of Hit Dice worth of undead you can control. By expending a second use of mythic power, you can ignore the spell's material component cost.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (6th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, any skeletons or zombies you create gain either the agile (see page 224) or savage (see page 224) mythic template. This template lasts for a number of days equal to your tier.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you're 8th tier and expend 10 uses of mythic power, any skeletons you create permanently gain the mythic skeleton template (see page 216).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Animate Objects</h2>\n<p>Animated objects you create with this spell get the maximum number of hit points per level, gain a +4 bonus to their Strength ability scores, and have 1-1/2 times the normal number of construction points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Animate Plants</h2>\n<p>As animate objects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Anticipate Peril</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>Add your tier to the spell's initiative bonus and the maximum initiative bonus the spell can grant.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Antimagic Field</h2>\n<p>Select a number of spell schools equal to half your tier. Spells and effects of the chosen schools are unaffected by the antimagic field.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Arboreal Hammer</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>You animate two branches instead of one, allowing the tree to attack twice per round. Add your tier to your caster level when determining the tree's Strength score. A creature struck by both slam attacks in the same round must succeed at a Fortitude save against the spell's DC or be staggered for 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (7th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the tree attempts three slam attacks per round and its slams bypass all damage reduction. A creature struck by all three slam attacks in the same round is stunned for 1 round and staggered for 1d4 rounds after the stun ends. A successful Fortitude save negates the stun and reduces the duration of being staggered by half.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Arcane Cannon</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Combat</p>\n<p>The cannon deals 6d10 points of damage on a successful hit. Add your tier to the cannon's hardness and your tier &times; 5 to its hit points. Its conductive property can channel any spell with a range of touch (you have to expend only one spell for this, not two). You may cast a spell with an energy descriptor on the cannon. If you do, for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level, half the cannon's damage is untyped damage and the other half is energy damage of the spell's type. Casting a spell with a different energy descriptor onto the cannon replaces its current energy type with that of the new spell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ascension</h2>\n<p><strong>School</strong> universal; <strong>Level</strong> cleric 9, druid 9, sorcerer/wizard 9, witch 9</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 hour</p>\n<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, F (minor artifact), M (10,000 gp in rare herbs, gems, and other exotic materials)</p>\n<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>\n<p><strong>Target</strong> one non-mythic creature/3 levels</p>\n<p><strong>Duration</strong> 2 hours/level; see text</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>\n<p>You imbue a number of creatures with mythic power, granting each of them 1st tier in a mythic path of its choice. The creatures immediately gain the benefits of their chosen paths. Divide the duration evenly among all targets.</p>\n<p>The targets retain their mythic tier only while they're within 100 feet of the spell's focus component. A target that goes outside this range loses its mythic tier, but instantly regains it if it moves into range again. If the focus component is destroyed while the spell is in effect, the spell immediately ends and all targets gain 1d4 permanent negative levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic:</strong> If you expend one use of mythic power when casting this spell, the duration increases to 1 day per level, and you can use yourself as the focus for this spell instead of a lesser artifact. If you're the focus, the targets retain their mythic tier only while they're within 100 feet of you, and if you die, the spell immediately ends and all targets gain 1d4 permanent negative levels.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Baleful Polymorph</h2>\n<p>The saving throw changes to Fortitude (partial) and Will (partial). A creature that fails the Fortitude save automatically fails the Will save. A target with the shapechanger subtype that fails its save can't use its shapechanging to shift out of its new form. A creature that succeeds at the Fortitude save is partially transformed into the intended animal. For 1 minute per level, it takes on cosmetic features appropriate to that animal and becomes one size category closer to the animal's size.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (9th):</strong> If you expend four uses of mythic power, the spell affects all other creatures with 8 Hit Dice or fewer in a 1-mile radius. Affected creatures transform into Small or smaller animals appropriate to the local environment. You can select a number of creatures up to your tier to not be affected.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Bane</h2>\n<p>The -1 penalty applies on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and all saving throws. Each affected creature must roll its next attack roll or saving throw twice and take the lower result.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Barkskin</h2>\n<p>The target also gains DR/magic equal to the double the enhancement bonus the spell provides to the target's natural armor bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (6th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell grants DR/epic rather than DR/magic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Battle Trance</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Race Guide</p>\n<p>The number of temporary hit points you gain increases to 2d6 + your caster level (maximum +10) + your tier. The morale bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects increases to +6.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (5th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, you gain a +4 morale bonus to Strength, immunity to non-mythic mind-affecting effects, and DR 5/epic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Battlemind Link</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>When you cast this spell, if your linked ally uses a mythic path ability against a creature, you can use the same path ability against that creature as if you had it yourself, and your linked ally can likewise use any path abilities you use against a creature (even if that ally isn't mythic). For example, if you're a champion attacking a frost giant using the precision path ability, your linked ally can use your precision ability when she attacks that frost giant. If a path ability requires expending uses of mythic power or any other cost, your linked ally must expend that cost for you to use the ability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Beast Shape (All)</h2>\n<p>Each mythic beast shape spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic beast shape spell to learn its mythic version. You don't have to learn them in order and are not required to know a lower-level mythic beast shape spell before you learn a higher-level one (for example, you can learn mythic beast shape II if you know beast shape II, even if you don't know mythic beast shape I). Each mythic beast shape spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version.</p>\n<p>The spell's bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the ability score penalties decrease by 2 (minimum penalty of 0). Choose one natural attack type the animal form has, such as bite or claws. The critical multiplier for this attack type increases by 1 (maximum &times;4).</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (2nd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. During each casting of the spell, a number of times equal to your tier, you can act as if you had the Natural Spell feat for 1 round. For example, if you're 2nd tier, you can use the Natural Spell feat for 2 rounds per casting of mythic beast shape.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Black Mark</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Race Guide</p>\n<p>Any time the cursed creature travels on or in the water more than 1 mile from shore, each day it (or the vessel it's on) is attacked by one or more aquatic or water monsters, as if summoned by summon nature's ally VII (caster level 13th).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Black Tentacles</h2>\n<p>Add your tier to the base attack bonus of the tentacles. The tentacles also deal an additional 2d6 points of acid damage with a successful grapple.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (6th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell creates twice as many tentacles in the same area, meaning each creature in the area is attacked twice per round. The tentacles can grapple creatures that are immune to grappling if that immunity is from a non-mythic source, but combat maneuver checks to grapple such creatures take a -5 penalty.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Blade Barrier</h2>\n<p>You may cast this spell as an immediate action. The barrier's damage increases to 1d8 per caster level (maximum 20d8).</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can spend a move action to move the barrier up to 10 feet in any direction. The shape (flat or ring) and orientation (vertical or horizontal) of the wall must remain the same. If you move the barrier through a creature's space, it can attempt a saving throw to avoid the wall, as if you had created it where the creature is.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Blasphemy</h2>\n<p>When determining the spell's effect on non-mythic creatures, add your tier to your caster level. Nonevil creatures that fail the save take a -4 penalty on attack rolls and saving throws, and their spell resistance decreases by 5 for as long as the spell's other effects last.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Bleed Glory</h2>\n<p><strong>School</strong> necromancy [curse]; <strong>Level</strong> cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>\n<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>\n<p><strong>Target</strong> one mythic creature</p>\n<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>\n<p>The mythic power cost for all path abilities, feats, spells, and other effects used by the target increases by 1.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Bless</h2>\n<p>The +1 morale bonus applies on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and all saving throws. Once during the spell's duration, an affected creature can roll an attack roll or saving throw twice and take the higher result. The target must decide to use this ability before the first roll is attempted.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Blessing Of Fervor</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>Affected creatures can choose two of the spell's bonuses each round rather than one.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Blinding Ray</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Race Guide</p>\n<p>On a successful saving throw, the target is dazzled for 1 round. On a failed saving throw, the target is instead blinded for 1d4 rounds.</p>\n<p>A target with light blindness, light sensitivity, or any other vulnerability to light is instead blinded for 1d4 rounds on a successful saving throw and permanently blinded on a failed saving throw.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Blindness/Deafness</h2>\n<p>You can cause the target to be both blinded and deafened at the same time. The target must attempt a saving throw against each effect separately.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Blink</h2>\n<p>You may spend a move action to remain corporeal or incorporeal until the end of your turn (you automatically resume blinking at the end of your turn).</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can spend either a swift action or a move action to remain corporeal or incorporeal until the end of your turn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Blistering Invective</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Combat</p>\n<p>Enemies that are demoralized by your Intimidate check take 2d8 points of fire damage and catch fire (no saving throw). Any Reflex save attempted to extinguish the flames automatically fails as long as the creature remains demoralized by your Intimidate check.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (5th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell doesn't have the language-dependent descriptor and you don't take a penalty on your Intimidate check to demoralize creatures that are larger than you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Blood Crow Strike</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>Unarmed strikes attempted with this spell are treated as if you had the Improved Critical (unarmed strike) feat. Use your tier plus your monk level (if any) when determining your unarmed strike damage for this spell. Fire damage from this spell bypasses fire resistance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Boiling Blood</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>A target that fails its save takes 1d3 points of fire damage per round. If a target has the orc subtype, it also gains fire resistance 5.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented:</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can affect allies as though they had the orc subtype.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Break</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>You can target up to 1 Medium or smaller object per caster level.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, target objects gain the broken condition on a successful save and are destroyed on a failed save. This doesn't affect mythic objects or objects held or carried by mythic creatures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Break Enchantment</h2>\n<p>Against non-mythic effects, the spell automatically succeeds without requiring a caster level check. Against mythic effects, add your tier to your caster level check. The maximum level of spell this spell can remove is 5 + half your tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (7th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can apply a removed enchantment, transmutation, or curse to the creature that originally cast it. The creature must be a valid target of the spell and on the same plane as you, and it gets a saving throw at the effect's original DC.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Breath Of Life</h2>\n<p>The spell heals 5d12 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25). It can revive a creature that died of hp damage within the past 2 rounds. If the target was slain by a death effect that allows a saving throw, this spell allows the creature to attempt another save against that effect. If this save is successful, the creature is revived with -10 hp plus the amount healed by this spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (9th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can target up to one creature per caster level within 30 feet of you. Alternatively, you can target one creature that has been dead for a number of rounds up to your caster level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Burning Gaze</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>You may focus your burning gaze on a creature or object as a move action instead of as a standard action. The target takes 1d8 points of fire damage for failing its save and for each round it's on fire.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented:</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, once during the spell's duration you can, as a full-round action, direct your burning gaze at up to one creature per caster level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Burning Hands</h2>\n<p>The range increases to 20 feet, and the damage dealt increases to 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 5d6).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Burrow</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>The target can breathe underground while burrowing. If you're 3rd tier, the burrow speed increases to 20 feet through sand, soil, or gravel, and to 10 feet through stone. At 6th tier, these speeds increase to 30 feet and 15 feet respectively. At 9th tier, these speeds increase to 40 feet and 20 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the burrowing creature may leave behind an open tunnel with a diameter equal to half its space. When the spell's effect ends, this tunnel closes up immediately.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Call Animal</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>You can call up to one animal per 2 caster levels. Animals that answer your call have a starting attitude of friendly. Add your tier to Handle Animal checks attempted to influence these animals.</p>\n<p>You may use this spell to call magical beasts with Intelligence 1 or 2, but they can attempt Will saving throws (with a +4 bonus) to resist the spell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Call Lightning</h2>\n<p>Each lightning bolt's damage increases to 3d10 points of damage (or 5d10 points outdoors in stormy weather). Half of this damage is electricity damage, and the other half is sonic. Creatures that succeed at their saving throws are dazzled and deafened for 1 round. Those that fail at their saving throws are dazzled and deafened for 1 minute.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cape Of Wasps</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>The wasp swarm fills a 15-foot-by-15-foot space centered on you (or on 1 of your squares, if your space is larger than 1 square). Creatures in the area of the swarm are affected by it normally (including the swarm's distraction ability). Add your tier to the swarm's distraction DC.</p>\n<p>When you use the swarm to fly, it fills only your space, your fly speed is 30 feet (average maneuverability), and the swarm still provides partial concealment against ranged attacks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Chain Lightning</h2>\n<p>This spell deals 1d10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d10) and the save DC isn't reduced for secondary targets. Secondary targets have to be within 30 feet of any other target, not necessarily the primary target.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Changestaff</h2>\n<p>The treant-like creature created with this spell is considered a mythic creature, and it gains DR 10/epic and slashing instead of gaining DR 10/slashing.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (7th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the creature gains the savage mythic template (see page 224).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Chaos Hammer</h2>\n<p>The damage dealt to lawful outsiders increases to 1d10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d10), and the damage dealt to other lawful creatures increases to 1d12 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d12). The duration of slow increases to 2d6 rounds. Lawful creatures that succeed at their saves are slowed for 1 round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Chill Metal</h2>\n<p>The damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of cold damage on rounds 2 and 6, and to 2d8 points of cold damage on rounds 3 through 5. Each round a creature takes cold damage from this spell, it also takes 1 point of Dexterity damage (Fortitude negates).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Chord Of Shards</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>The damage dealt increases to 2d8 points of piercing damage and bypasses all damage reduction. Any creature damaged by the shards takes 1d8 points of sonic damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Circle Of Death</h2>\n<p>The number of Hit Dice worth of creatures killed by the spell increases to 1d6 per caster level (maximum 20d6). Add your tier to the maximum HD of creatures that can be affected by the spell. (For example, at 3rd tier, a creature with 12 HD cannot be affected.)</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (6th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, creatures that succeed at their saves against this spell take 1d6 points of damage per tier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cloudkill</h2>\n<p>As a move action, you can move the cloud 10 feet in any direction. Add your tier to the spell's level and Hit Dice categories to determine its effect on creatures. (For example, at 3rd tier a creature with 6 or fewer HD gets no save, one with 7-9 HD must save or die, and one with 10 or more HD must save or take 1d4 points of Con damage.)</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (6th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell bypasses the poison immunity of living creatures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Color Spray</h2>\n<p>The range increases to 30 feet. Add half your tier to the spell's Hit Dice categories to determine its effects on creatures. (At 3rd tier a creature with 3 or fewer HD is unconscious, blinded, and stunned; one with 4 or 5 HD is blinded and stunned, and one with 6 or more HD is stunned.) Creatures that succeed at their saves are dazzled for 1 minute.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Command</h2>\n<p>You can target up to one creature per level, each of which must receive the same command. Creatures that succeed at their saving throws are staggered for 1 round (this is a mind-affecting effect).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Companion Mind Link</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Combat</p>\n<p>Your animal companion understands complex instructions transmitted by the spell. It can perform any trick (even one it doesn't know) as well as any activity that could be understood by a creature with an Intelligence score of 8.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cone Of Cold</h2>\n<p>The damage dealt increases to 1d10 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d10). Any creature that fails its save is partially encased in ice, reducing its speed by half. Creatures with the cold or incorporeal subtype or immunity to being grappled are immune to this effect. The reduced movement lasts until the ice is destroyed. Destroying the ice requires a successful Strength or dispel check against the spell's DC, or dealing bludgeoning or fire damage equal to 1 point per caster level to the creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented:</strong> You can expend two uses of mythic power to transform the spell's cold into a barrage of giant hailstones, icicles, or shards. Half the spell's damage is your choice of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, and the other half is cold damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Confusion</h2>\n<p>Roll on the table below instead of the non-mythic version at the start of each subject's turn to see what it does in that round.</p>\n<table style=\"width: 97.5852%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.50899%;\"><strong>d%</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 90.7632%;\"><strong>Behavior</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.50899%;\">01-25</td>\n<td style=\"width: 90.7632%;\">Subject acts normally, but takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks until its next turn.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.50899%;\">26-50</td>\n<td style=\"width: 90.7632%;\">Subject does nothing but babble incoherently, and takes a -4 penalty to AC until its next turn.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.50899%;\">51-75</td>\n<td style=\"width: 90.7632%;\">Subject deals 2d8 points of damage + Str modifier to self with item in hand.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.50899%;\">76-100</td>\n<td style=\"width: 90.7632%;\">Subject attacks nearest ally (for this purpose, a familiar counts as an ally).</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Augmented:</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power when casting the spell, you force one affected creature per round to roll on the table twice and take the higher result.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Conjure Black Pudding</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>The black pudding has fast healing equal to your tier, as do any puddings that split off from it. The black puddings from this spell never attack you, though they're otherwise uncontrolled and might attack your allies if there are no other obvious opponents.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (6th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the pudding gains the savage mythic template (see page 224). Puddings that split off from the giant pudding don't gain the template.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Consecrate</h2>\n<p>Select one alignment component that you have (chaotic, good, or lawful). The spell's penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves also affects outsiders with the opposite alignment subtype as if they were undead.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Contagion</h2>\n<p>The affected target is highly contagious. Any creature it touches or that touches it with natural weapons or unarmed strikes must save or contract the disease. The save DC for these targets is equal to the spell's DC - 4. The target can't spread this disease to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (7th):</strong> If you expend five uses of mythic power, the spell targets every living creature within a 1-mile radius. You can select one creature per caster level within your line of sight; these creatures are unaffected by the spell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Contingency</h2>\n<p>You can cast this spell on yourself or another willing creature as if the spell had a range of touch. A companion spell placed on another creature must be a spell from you, not from the creature, and affects that creature when triggered. The target can have only one contingency spell upon it at a time unless it also knows mythic contingency. The number of companion spells you can have on yourself is equal to 1 + half your tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (5th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the casting time changes to 1 full round plus the casting time of the companion spell, but the duration of mythic contingency decreases to 1 hour per level or until discharged.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Control Weather</h2>\n<p>The casting time changes to 1 standard action, and the duration doubles. The weather changes after a number of rounds equal to 11 - your tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (6th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can create weather of any type regardless of the season, and the weather changes after 1 round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cup Of Dust</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>On a failed save, the target immediately takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per tier. Add your tier to the DC of any further Constitution checks the target attempts to resist dehydration as part of this spell's effects. While the curse is in effect, the target gains no benefit from any spell, effect, or item that requires drinking, such as potions and elixirs (though these are still used up when the target drinks them).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cure Critical Wounds</h2>\n<p>The damage cured increases to 8d8 points of damage + 2 points per caster level (maximum +40). The spell cures up to 4 points of ability damage if the target is a living creature. The target chooses what types of ability damage are cured.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cure Light Wounds</h2>\n<p>The damage cured increases to 2d8 points of damage + 2 points per caster level (maximum +10). The spell cures up to 1 point of ability damage if the target is a living creature. The target chooses what type of ability damage is cured.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cure Moderate Wounds</h2>\n<p>The damage cured increases to 4d8 points of damage + 2 points per caster level (maximum +20). The spell cures up to 2 points of ability damage if the target is a living creature. The target chooses what types of ability damage are cured.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cure Serious Wounds</h2>\n<p>The damage cured increases to 6d8 points of damage + 2 points per caster level (maximum +30). The spell cures up to 3 points of ability damage if the target is a living creature. The target chooses what types of ability damage are cured.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Damnation Stride</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Race Guide</p>\n<p>The burst of fire created reeks of sulfur and brimstone and also acts like stinking cloud (with the same duration as that spell and a separate Fortitude save).</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (6th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, you bring one unwilling adjacent creature with you. You may bring additional creatures, but each must be adjacent to you and each requires you to expend one additional use of mythic power. These creatures must first attempt a saving throw against the burst of flame and stinking cloud, then can attempt a Will saving throw to resist being teleported with you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Darkness</h2>\n<p>The illumination level in the area drops to darkness regardless of the existing lighting conditions. Non-mythic spells and effects can't increase the light level in the area. Creatures with darkvision and the power to see in darkness have difficulty seeing through this darkness, and can see as well as a human can in dim light. Creatures in the area of darkness take a -2 penalty on saves against fear.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Daybreak Arrow</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Combat</p>\n<p>The additional damage to undead and creatures harmed by sunlight increases to 1d8. The affected ammunition is entirely composed of radiant energy, and bypasses all damage resistance from undead targets and those harmed by sunlight. The duration of the sunrod light effect increases to 1 minute.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Daylight</h2>\n<p>The illumination in the additional 60 foot radius increases to at least normal light regardless of the existing lighting conditions. Creatures that take penalties in bright light double those penalties while in the area of bright light produced by this spell. All other creatures in the area of bright light gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Perception checks and saves to resist fear.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Death Knell</h2>\n<p>Increase the spell's range to close (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels). Increase the temporary hp gained from the spell to 2d8 and the enhancement bonuses to Strength to +4, and gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the casting time decreases to 1 immediate action, and you may target a creature that you killed on your last turn as if it were still alive; the dead target gets no save.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Deathless</h2>\n<p><strong>School</strong> necromancy; <strong>Level</strong> alchemist 4, cleric 4, inquisitor 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 4</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>\n<p><strong>Range</strong> touch</p>\n<p><strong>Target</strong> living creature touched</p>\n<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 round/level</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Fortitude negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>\n<p>The target's soul is strongly anchored to its body, preventing death from hit point damage. No matter how low the target's hit points get, it remains alive (though not necessarily conscious).</p>\n<p>This spell doesn't prevent death from sources other than hit point damage - such as Constitution damage or drain, death effects, or energy drain. Spells that cure hit points affect the creature normally.</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic:</strong> If you expend one use of mythic power when you cast the spell, you become an anchor for the souls of you and your cohorts. The range increases to 30 feet, and instead of affecting one creature, it affects all allies within a 30-foot-radius emanation centered on you.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (8th):</strong> If you expend three uses of mythic power, the range increases to 1 mile, and the area to a 1-mile-radius emanation centered on you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Deep Slumber</h2>\n<p>This spell works like mythic sleep, except that it affects up to 20 Hit Dice of creatures. Alternatively, you may target one creature rather than an area, increasing the duration to 1 hour per level.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (5th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, creatures affected by the spell can be awakened only by mythic effects. If you're 5th tier and expend three uses of mythic power, the duration increases to 10 years per tier. If you're 5th tier and expend four uses of mythic power, the spell has both augmented effects. Creatures sleeping for years because of this spell age and breathe as normal, but don't need to eat or drink while the spell lasts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Defile Armor</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>You gain DR 5/good while wearing the target armor. While using your judgment or smite ability, this improves to DR 10/good.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, while you use your judgment or smite, add half your tier to your AC as a profane bonus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Desecrate</h2>\n<p>Select one alignment component that you have (chaotic, evil, or lawful). Outsiders with the opposite alignment subtype of the chosen alignment component take a -1 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves in the area.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Detect Scrying</h2>\n<p>This spell automatically gives you a visual image of the creature scrying you. If it's using a non-mythic means of scrying, you also gain an accurate sense of its direction and distance from you. You automatically succeed at caster level checks to overcome nondetection or similar effects (other than mind blank) that block your ability to detect the creature.</p>\n<p>If you learn the creature's direction and distance with this spell, you can, as an immediate action, cast a mind-affecting spell through the scrying sensor to target the creature. This spell affects only the scrying creature, even if the spell normally affects an area or multiple targets. You must expend a number of uses of mythic power equal to the level of the spell you wish to cast against the creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (6th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, even mind blank doesn't prevent you from detecting the scrying creature. If you teleport to the creature's location within 1 minute, you arrive on target (with no chance of error) and bypass non-mythic effects that block teleportation. Alternatively, you can compel the creature to attempt to teleport to you within 1 minute (Will negates, DC equal to 10 plus double your tier). It must use its own means of teleportation to do so, but you guarantee it arrives on target and bypasses non-mythic effects that block teleportation to your location.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Devolution</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>The saving throw changes to Will (partial). If it succeeds at its save, the eidolon loses one evolution, chosen at random.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dictum</h2>\n<p>When determining the spell's effect on non-mythic creatures, add your tier to your caster level. Nonlawful creatures that fail their saves against the spell also take a -4 penalty on attack rolls and saving throws, and their spell resistance decreases by 5 for as long as the spell's other effects last.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dimension Door</h2>\n<p>The duration of this spell changes to 1 round per 2 caster levels, and it creates a temporary, invisible, one-way portal in your square to your destination. You immediately pass through the portal and arrive at the destination, but you can't take any other creatures with you.</p>\n<p>When casting the spell, you can designate a number of creatures equal to your caster level. These creatures can see and use the portal, passing through it to arrive at the destination (this isn't an action). A creature that passes through the portal can't take any other actions until its next turn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dimensional Lock</h2>\n<p>The spell doesn't interfere with your extradimensional travel spells and effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (4th):</strong> You can augment mythic dimensional lock to redirect teleporting creatures to another location. If you expend two uses of mythic power, designate a location that you're very familiar with. This location must be on the same plane as you. Any creature attempting to use extradimensional travel from outside the spell's area into that area is instead redirected to this other location.</p>\n<p>The creature can attempt a Spellcraft check against your caster level. If it succeeds, it's aware of the redirection (though not the destination) and can interrupt its spellcasting, losing the spell but not teleporting.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Discordant Blast</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>The damage dealt increases to 5d6 points of sonic damage, and you gain a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to the bull rush opponents. The spell can penetrate non-mythic magical silence and dispels any non-mythic silence effect of 4th level or lower.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Disfiguring Touch</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>The target takes two different penalties (chosen from the same list) instead of one.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented:</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target also gains the fatigued condition because of its painful disfigurement. If this fatigue is negated without removing the curse, it returns after 1 hour.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Disintegrate</h2>\n<p>The damage dealt increases to 3d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 60d6) plus 1d4 points of Constitution damage. A creature that succeeds at its saving throw takes 5d8 points of damage plus 1 point of Constitution damage.</p>\n<p>A creature whose Constitution score is reduced to 0 by this spell is entirely disintegrated.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (7th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, you fire two rays.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you may fire only one ray, but if the target is a non-mythic creature and it fails its saving throw, it's automatically disintegrated regardless of its current hp.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dispel Magic</h2>\n<p>When used as a targeted dispel, this spell can end two spells affecting the target instead of just one. If the targeted dispel successfully dispels at least one spell, you heal 1d4 points of damage for every spell level of the dispelled spell. If you dispel two spells, this healing applies only to the highest-level spell dispelled. If you use this spell to counterspell, roll your dispel check twice and take the higher result.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Divine Favor</h2>\n<p>You also gain the luck bonus on saving throws and skill checks. Alternatively, you can cast this spell on another willing creature, changing the range to touch and target to living creature touched.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Divine Pursuit</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>The speed of the movement form provided by the spell increases by 30 feet. This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus. You gain a bonus on Perception and Survival skill checks attempted against the selected creature. This is a sacred bonus if you're good or a profane bonus if you're evil; if you're neutral, choose either the sacred or profane bonus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dominate Person</h2>\n<p>The Sense Motive DC to notice your target is dominated increases by double your tier. You can give orders to the target even if it's protected by non-mythic effects that block magical control, such as protection from evil. If the target is protected by a mythic effect, you can attempt to overcome this defense with a caster level check (DC 15 plus the caster level of the effect); add your tier to your roll and the opposing caster's tier to the DC. If the target succeeds at its Will save to break your control, as an immediate action you can expend one use of mythic power to force it to reroll the save and use the lower result.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Draconic Reservoir</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>The amount of energy damage the spell absorbs increases to 10 points per caster level (maximum 100 points). The energy damage from the weapons improves as if using a corrosive burst, flaming burst, icy burst, or shocking burst weapon.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, spending a swift action applies the energy damage to any number of creatures the target hits this round, not just the first.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dragon's Breath</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>The spell's duration changes to 1 minute/level or until discharged. You can use the breath weapon up to three times during this duration. On the round you cast the spell, using the breath weapon is a free action; later uses require a standard action. You must wait 1d4 rounds between each use of the breath weapon. All uses for a particular casting have the same range, area, and energy type. You can have only one dragon's breath spell in effect at a time; casting a new one ends the previous one.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dream</h2>\n<p>You or the messenger may gain information from the dreamer you contact by asking questions as if using speak with dead to speak with a corpse. An unwilling dreamer can attempt to resist this probing with a Will save (as speak with dead, using the DC dream would have if it allowed a saving throw). Answers to these questions are still generally brief and cryptic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dust Of Twilight</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>A creature that fails its Fortitude save against the spell must also succeed at a Will save at the same DC or fall asleep (as the sleep spell). Creatures that succeed at their saves are merely drowsy (as the lullaby spell).</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented:</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, add half your tier to the level of light spells mythic dust of twilight dispels.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ear-Piercing Scream</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>The damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of sonic damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d8) and the duration that creatures in the area are dazed is a number of rounds equal to your tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell affects a 30-foot cone rather than a single target.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Earthquake</h2>\n<p>Increase the damage dealt to structures by 10 points of damage per tier. Increase the damage dealt by cave-ins and landslides to 10d8 points of damage. Increase the damage dealt to those pinned beneath rubble to 1d10 points per minute. Add your tier to the DC of concentration checks and Constitution checks attempted as a consequence of this spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (8th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell lasts for an additional round and the spread's radius increases by 20 feet. Each round this spell is in effect, on your turn you may expend one use of mythic power to continue its duration for 1 round and increase its radius by another 20 feet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Elemental Body (All)</h2>\n<p>Each mythic elemental body spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic elemental body spell to learn its mythic version. You don't have to learn them in order, and aren't required to know a lower-level mythic elemental body spell before you learn a higher-level one (for example, you can learn mythic elemental body II if you know elemental body II, even if you don't know mythic elemental body I). Each mythic elemental body spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version.</p>\n<p>The spell's bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the ability score penalties decrease by 2 (minimum penalty of 0). There is a 50% chance any critical hit or sneak attack against you is treated as a normal hit, as if you were wearing medium fortification armor.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. You can also, a number of times equal to your tier, add half your tier to the DC of one spell you cast with an energy descriptor that matches your elemental type (air: electricity, earth: acid, fire: fire, water: cold).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Endure Elements</h2>\n<p>The target changes to one creature touched per level. Affected creatures gain cold resistance 5 and fire resistance 5. They're not slowed by snow, and ignore penalties on Perception checks and ranged weapon attacks from hail, rain, sleet, and snow. They treat wind as one category weaker.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Enemy Hammer</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>The target becomes entangled whether or not it succeeds at its saving throw. When using the target as a weapon, add half your tier to your attack roll, and add your tier to the damage roll.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, when you use the target to hit a creature, you can attempt a free bull rush combat maneuver against that creature. Your CMB for this maneuver is equal to your attack bonus for mythic enemy hammer, except you add your tier instead of half your tier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Enervation</h2>\n<p>The number of negative levels inflicted increases to 1d6, and the target is sickened for 24 hours. An undead creature struck by the ray gains 1d6 &times; 5 temporary hit points for a number of hours equal to your caster level.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, any creature attempting to remove the target's negative levels must succeed at a caster level check (DC 10 + your caster level + your tier).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Enlarge Person</h2>\n<p>You can increase the target's size by up to two size categories, to a maximum of Huge. If the target grows two sizes, its weight increases by a factor of 25, it gains a +4 size bonus to Strength, and takes a -4 size penalty to Dexterity and a -2 penalty on attack rolls and to AC because of its increased size. A Medium humanoid creature whose size increases to Huge has a space of 15 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. Mythic enlarge person counters and dispels mythic reduce person.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Entangle</h2>\n<p>The spell functions in areas without any vegetation, causing plants to spring up out of the ground. These plants can reach creatures that are up to 10 feet in the air. Plants affected or created by the spell sprout thorns that deal 1d6 points of damage each round to creatures in the area.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Entropic Shield</h2>\n<p>When a ranged attack misses because of this spell, there is a 50% chance that the attack is redirected back at the attacker rather than just being deflected harmlessly. The attack uses the same result as the attack roll the attacker made against you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Expeditious Retreat</h2>\n<p>The speed bonus from the spell increases to 40 feet. Add your tier to Acrobatics checks to avoid attacks of opportunity from movement, and when your movement provokes an attack of opportunity, add your tier to your AC against that attack.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Faerie Fire</h2>\n<p>Outlined creatures are dazzled. The spell outlines figment illusions in the burst, revealing them as such. This effect applies only to figments with a caster level equal to or less than your tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (2nd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, each creature in the burst must succeed at a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>False Life</h2>\n<p>The temporary hit points gained increase to 2d8 + 2 per caster level (maximum +20). As an immediate action, you can dismiss the remaining duration of the spell to prevent 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution damage per 10 temporary hit points remaining from the spell. This takes effect after the attack hits you and the damage is rolled, but before you take the damage. For example, if you have 22 temporary hit points from mythic false life and a wyvern stings you for 3 points of Constitution damage, you can dismiss the spell to prevent 2 points of Constitution damage from that attack.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Feast Of Ashes</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>On a failed save, the target immediately takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per tier. Add your tier to the DC of any further Constitution checks the target attempts to resist the effects of starvation as part of this spell's effects. While the curse is in effect, the target gains no benefit from any spell, effect, or item that requires eating, such as the food from a heroes' feast spell (though the food is still used up when the target eats it).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Feather Fall</h2>\n<p>The spell affects one additional target per level. The targets don't have to be within 20 feet of each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (4th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell absorbs the targets' velocity and transforms it into a concussive blast. Targets fall at the normal rate (not slowed) but land safely. When a target lands, it creates a 10-foot-radius burst of force that deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 5d6, Reflex half, DC equal to the DC of feather fall). The targets of this spell are unaffected by these concussive blasts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Finger Of Death</h2>\n<p>The damage dealt increases to 15 points of damage per caster level plus 1d8 points of Constitution damage. A creature that succeeds at its saving throw takes 3d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level, takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage, and is staggered for 1 round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Fire Seeds</h2>\n<p>Each acorn's damage increases to 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6 for all acorns, no more than 10d6 for any particular acorn). Each holly berry's damage increases to 2d6 points of fire damage + 2 points per caster level. Any creature that fails its Reflex save against an acorn or holly berry catches on fire (Core Rulebook 444), taking 2d6 points of fire damage each round until the fire is extinguished. Attempts to extinguish this fire use the spell's save DC.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Fire Shield</h2>\n<p>The damage dealt to your attackers increases to 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). A chill shield gives you fire immunity. A warm shield gives you cold immunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Fire Snake</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>The damage dealt increases to 1d10 points of damage per level (maximum 15d10). Any creature that fails its saving throw against the spell is grappled by a snake made of fire that lasts for 1 round per caster level. The snake can be dispelled, but not attacked. A grappled creature takes 1d10 points of fire damage on your turn each round. The snake's CMB is equal to your caster level plus your tier, and its CMD is equal to its CMB + 10.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (6th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the maximum damage increases to 20d10, and any creature that fails its saving throw against the spell is pinned instead of grappled.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Fire Storm</h2>\n<p>The damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d8). Half of this damage is fire damage, and the other half is divine energy that bypasses fire resistance and fire immunity. You can exclude any number of animals from damage just as you can plant creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (8th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, choose one creature type (and subtype, if humanoid or outsider) to exclude from the effects of the spell. For each additional use of mythic power you expend when casting the spell, exclude another creature type. For example, if you expend two uses of mythic power and choose magical beasts, you can exclude from damage any number of magical beasts in the spell's area.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Fireball</h2>\n<p>The damage dealt increases to 1d10 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d10). Any creature that fails its Reflex saving throw catches on fire (Core Rulebook 444), taking 2d6 points of fire damage each round until the fire is extinguished. Attempts to extinguish this fire use the spell's save DC.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (6th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the maximum damage increases to 20d10, the area increases to a 40-foot radius spread, and any fire damage dealt by the spell bypasses fire resistance and fire immunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Firestream</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Race Guide</p>\n<p>The damage dealt increases to 2d10 points of fire damage. Any creature that fails its saving throw also catches fire (Core Rulebook 444). The continuous line of fire pushes against all creatures, making them treat the spell's area as difficult terrain.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (4th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, you create a second line of fire using your other hand. If you overlap the lines, creatures in the overlap must attempt two saving throws and take the lower result, but don't take damage from both lines. You may stop either line of fire as a free action on your turn, but once you stop maintaining a line, you must cast mythic firestream again to recreate it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Flame Blade</h2>\n<p>The blade's damage increases to 2d6 points of fire damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20). The blade threatens a critical hit on a natural 18-20 as if it were an actual scimitar.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the blade threatens a critical hit on a natural 15-20, and bypasses hardness, fire resistance, and fire immunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Flame Strike</h2>\n<p>The damage dealt increases to 1d8 per caster level (maximum 15d8). The area increases to a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder. You may have the divine half of the damage affect only one specific creature type (as the bane weapon quality).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Flames Of The Faithful</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>The fire damage dealt by this spell bypasses fire resistance and fire immunity. On a successful critical hit, the target catches on fire (Core Rulebook 444).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Flesh To Stone</h2>\n<p>A creature that succeeds at its saving throw is partially petrified, becoming slowed (as the slow spell) for a number of rounds equal to your tier. The creature can end this effect early by spending a full-round action breaking away its own petrified flesh, dealing 5d10 points of damage to itself. Any effect that removes or reverses petrification negates this partial petrification and the slow effect.</p>\n<p>The spell can affect objects and undead, as long as the target is primarily made of flesh or bone, such as a corpse or zombie. The spell doesn't affect the target's gear. If cast on a creature with equipment, the creature transforms into stone but its gear doesn't.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (9th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, any Large or smaller creature fully petrified by the spell immediately animates and follows your commands, as if you had cast animate objects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Floating Disk</h2>\n<p>The disk created by this spell lasts for 2 hours per caster level and can carry up to 200 pounds of weight per caster level.</p>\n<p>The disk accompanies you regardless of your speed, always catching up no matter how far you move. If you stand or sit on the disk, as a move action you can direct it to travel up to 30 feet in any direction.</p>\n<p>Any objects resting on the disk count as weightless parts of your gear for the purpose of teleportation effects (allowing these items to go with you when you teleport despite the weight limit of the teleportation spell).</p>\n<p>As a free action, you can transform the plane of force from a concave disk into a bucket-like shape that holds up to 4 gallons (or transform it from the bucket-like form back to its normal disk form).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Fly</h2>\n<p>The fly speed changes to 120 feet (or 80 feet if the target is wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load) with perfect maneuverability. When the duration expires, the target is protected by feather fall for a number of rounds equal to your caster level.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target adds your tier on Reflex saves and as a dodge bonus to AC. It gains these bonuses only while flying.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Fog Cloud</h2>\n<p>The radius of the fog increases to 50 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the fog's radius changes to 500 feet, and its height changes to 100 feet. Winds can't dissipate the fog unless the area of the wind affects the entire area of the augmented mythic fog cloud.</p>\n<p>If you're at least 6th tier and instead expend three uses of mythic power, the range increases to 1 mile, the fog's radius changes to 1 mile, and its height changes to 500 feet. The cloud is as resistant to wind as the 3rd-tier augmented version.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Force Punch</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>The damage dealt increases to 1d6 points of force damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). If moving the target would push it into another creature's space and it has at least 10 feet of distance remaining, you can attempt to overrun the other creature, adding your tier on the combat maneuver check. For each creature you overrun with the target, reduce the distance the target moves by 5 feet. If moving the target would push it into a solid obstacle (such as a wall or tree), the target takes damage as if it had fallen the distance pushed.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can cast this spell as a ranged touch attack with a range of close (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels), and the target is treated as two size categories smaller for the purpose of determining the total distance pushed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Foresight</h2>\n<p>The spell's insight bonus increases to +3. If you cast the spell on another creature, you and the target are simultaneously warned by the spell, and the target gains the spell's insight bonuses.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Form Of The Dragon (All)</h2>\n<p>Each mythic form of the dragon spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic form of the dragon spell to learn its mythic version. You don't have to learn them in order, and aren't required to know a lower-level mythic form of the dragon spell before you learn a higher-level one (for example, you can learn mythic form of the dragon II if you know form of the dragon II, even if you don't know mythic form of the dragon I). Each mythic form of the dragon spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version.</p>\n<p>The spell's bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the breath weapon damage increases to 10d6. All of the dragon form's natural attacks increase by one step (see Improved Natural Attack on page 315 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary).</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. During each casting of the spell, you can revert to your normal form or back to your dragon form without ending the spell a number of times equal to your tier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Gaseous Form</h2>\n<p>The damage reduction changes to DR 10/epic and magic, and the fly speed increases to 30 feet. The target can expand itself as a free action, filling an area equal to double its normal space and height (a Medium creature fills a 10-foot-by-10-foot space to a height of about 10 feet) and blocking vision as obscuring mist. Returning from expanded to normal size is also a free action.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented:</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target can shift into or out of gaseous form as a move action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Giant Vermin</h2>\n<p>The vermin you transform with this spell gain DR 5/magic and either the advanced creature template or the giant creature template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 294, 295).</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (6th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, any vermin you transform also gains either the agile (see page 224) or savage mythic template (see page 224) while the spell lasts.</p>\n<p>If you're at least 9th tier and expend three uses of mythic power, the duration changes to instantaneous, meaning the vermin retain their giant size. After a number of days equal to your tier, you lose control over the vermin unless you have some other way of controlling them, and they lose the agile or savage mythic template but retain the advanced or giant creature template.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Globe Of Invulnerability</h2>\n<p>Add half your tier to the level of non-mythic spells the globe excludes. The globe excludes mythic spells of 4th level or lower.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Glyph Of Warding</h2>\n<p>Add your tier to the DC to detect or disable the glyph. Blast glyph damage increases to 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). Add half your tier to the maximum spell level you can store in a spell glyph.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Goodberry</h2>\n<p>Each berry provides a full day's nourishment and counts as 1 hour of complete rest for the purpose of removing exhaustion, fatigue, or nonlethal damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (2nd):</strong> You can cast the spell to affect only one berry, imbuing into that berry any harmless druid spell you have prepared. The spell remains stored in the berry for the duration of the goodberry spell or until the berry is consumed. A creature that eats the berry gains the benefits of that spell as if you had cast it upon her. The maximum level of the imbued spell is equal to half your tier, and you must expend one use of mythic power for each spell level of the imbued spell (in addition to the one use needed to cast mythic goodberry). Similar to imbue with spell ability, you can't prepare a spell in that spell's slot until the berry is consumed or the mythic goodberry spell ends.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Grease</h2>\n<p>If you cast mythic grease on an area, add your tier to the Acrobatics DC to move within or through the area. If you cast it on a creature's armor or clothing, add your tier to its Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks attempted to escape a grapple and to its CMD to avoid being grappled.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented:</strong> You can expend two uses of mythic power to make the grease flammable. It ignites from any fire at least the size of a candle flame. If a greased area is ignited, any creature in the area on your turn takes 1d3 points of fire damage and might catch on fire (Core Rulebook 444). If a greased creature is ignited, it takes 2d6 points of fire damage, and might catch on fire; add your tier to the save DC.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Guards and Wards</h2>\n<p>You are alerted whenever any creature enters the warded area as if by a mental alarm spell as long as you're on the same plane as the warded area. At will, you can concentrate to observe the warded area as if using arcane eye. When you start concentrating, the sensor always appears at a point you designate when you cast the spell. You can place two of the five effects listed in the spell (dancing lights and so on) instead of one.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> You can place the following effects anywhere within the warded area by expending one additional use of mythic power per effect.</p>\n<p>6. Black tentacles in one place, returning after 10 minutes if dispelled.</p>\n<p>7. Dispel magic in one place. You select an area up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area is targeted by the spell. Saving Throw: Will negates. Spell Resistance: yes.</p>\n<p>8. Entangle in four places, returning in 10 minutes if dispelled.</p>\n<p>9. Explosive runes in three places, returning in 10 minutes if activated or dispelled.</p>\n<p>10. Slow in three places, returning in 10 minutes if dispelled.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Gust Of Wind</h2>\n<p>The force of the wind increases to windstorm (approximately 70 mph; Core Rulebook 439). All effects described in the spell affect creatures one size larger. Ranged attacks can't be attempted in the area of the spell. The wind automatically blows out unprotected flames and has a 75% chance of blowing out protected flames.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (2nd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell lasts for 1 additional round and the range increases by 30 feet. As a swift action at the start of your turn, you can expend another use of mythic power to extend the duration by 1 round and the range by another 30 feet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Harm</h2>\n<p>The damage dealt increases to 15 points of damage per caster level (maximum 225 points).</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented:</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell also acts as poison.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Haste</h2>\n<p>Affected creatures gain an additional move action each round. The movement speed increase changes to 50 feet, to a maximum of three times the creature's normal speed for that movement type.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the movement speed increase changes to 70 feet, with no limit based on the creature's normal speed. If an affected creature moves at least 30 feet on its turn, it can travel across liquid as if the liquid were solid. If the liquid deals damage on contact, the creature takes only half damage from moving across it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Heal</h2>\n<p>The damage cured increases to 15 points of damage per caster level (maximum 225 points).</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented:</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell also acts as restoration.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Healing Thief</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Combat</p>\n<p>Instead of stealing half the target's healing, you steal all of it. The amount of damage you steal before the spell is discharged increases to 10 points per caster level (maximum 100 points).</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the range of the spell changes to close (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels). If the target has fast healing or regeneration, you steal half of its fast healing or regeneration. Healing from these abilities count toward the maximum healing stolen before the spell is discharged.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Heat Metal</h2>\n<p>The damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of fire damage on rounds 2 and 6 and to 2d8 points of fire damage per round on rounds 3 through 5. On any round in which a creature takes fire damage from this spell, that creature must succeed at a Reflex save or catch on fire (Core Rulebook 444).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Heroism</h2>\n<p>The morale bonus increases to +4 and applies on all checks, attack rolls, saves, and weapon damage rolls. Allies adjacent to the target gain a +4 morale bonus on saves against fear effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target can attempt one additional attack per round when taking a full attack action (as if using a haste spell). The target can use this additional attack ability a number of times equal to your tier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hex Ward</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>The target gains immunity to one witch hex (but not a major hex or grand hex) of your choice.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, instead of granting immunity to one witch hex, you can grant immunity to two hexes or one major hex.</p>\n<p>If you're at least 6th tier and expend three uses of mythic power, you instead grant immunity to three hexes, two major hexes, or one grand hex.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hideous Laughter</h2>\n<p>A creature of a type different than your own doesn't gain a bonus on its saving throws against this spell. The affected target laughs so hard it hurts, and takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage each round it spends laughing.</p>\n<p>If the target fails its initial save, it must succeed at two follow-up saving throws (each a full-round action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity) to end the spell. Succeeding at only one save means the spell no longer deals damage, but the target is still unable to take actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented:</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target's laughter becomes contagious. When the target's allies are within 30 feet and can hear the laugh, they must successfully save against the spell or be sickened until the target stops laughing. The sickened effect ends if the ally moves more than 30 feet from the target or is unable to hear the target's laughter for an entire round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hold Portal</h2>\n<p>The target portal can be as large as 30 square feet per caster level. A creature attempting to force open the portal must first succeed at a Will save against the spell's DC. This is a mind-affecting effect. Failure means the creature can't open the door while the spell is in effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Holy Smite</h2>\n<p>The damage dealt to evil outsiders increases to 1d10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d10) and the damage dealt to other evil creatures increases to 1d12 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d12). The duration that creatures in the area are blinded increases to 2 rounds. On a successful save, an evil creature is blinded for 1 round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Holy Word</h2>\n<p>When determining the spell's effect on non-mythic creatures, add your tier to your caster level. Nongood creatures that fail their saves also take a -4 penalty on attack rolls and saving throws, and their spell resistance decreases by 5 for as long as the spell's other effects last.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hydraulic Push</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>The water is boiling hot or freezing cold, dealing 1d6 points of fire or cold damage per 2 caster levels. Add your tier to your CMB for the spell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hydraulic Torrent</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>The water is boiling hot or freezing cold, dealing 1d6 points of fire or cold damage per 2 caster levels. Add your tier to your CMB for the spell and on the Strength check to destroy immovable targets.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell can extinguish magical fires as if using a targeted dispel magic. Freezing cold water hardens into ice on the ground (Core Rulebook 442), lasting as long as prevailing conditions allow. Boiling hot water turns into steam, creating an area of concealing mist (equivalent to obscuring mist) that fills the affected squares and all squares adjacent to the line of the spell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ice Storm</h2>\n<p>The bludgeoning damage increases to 4d8 points of damage and the cold damage increases to 3d6 points of damage. The ground in the area is covered in ice and hailstones, acting as though a grease spell were cast on it. Dealing 5 or more points of fire damage to a square melts the ice and hail, negating the grease effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (6th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, one creature in the area is paralyzed (as if by hold person) and gains vulnerability to fire as long as it's paralyzed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ill Omen</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>For the target's unlucky d20 rolls, it must roll three times and take the lowest result. Spending a move action to utter a prayer or good luck charm allows the target to roll twice instead of three times.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (4th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, you afflict the target with especially foul luck. Any natural 20 it rolls counts as a natural 1 instead.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Inflict Critical Wounds</h2>\n<p>The damage dealt increases to 8d8 points of damage + 2 points per caster level (maximum +40). A living target is sickened for 1 round per caster level (maximum 20 rounds) if it fails its saving throw.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Inflict Light Wounds</h2>\n<p>The damage dealt increases to 2d8 points of damage + 2 points per caster level (maximum +10). A living target is sickened for 1 round per caster level (maximum 5 rounds) if it fails its saving throw.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Inflict Moderate Wounds</h2>\n<p>The damage dealt increases to 4d8 points of damage + 2 points per caster level (maximum +20). A living target is sickened for 1 round per caster level (maximum 10 rounds) if it fails its saving throw.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Inflict Serious Wounds</h2>\n<p>The damage dealt increases to 6d8 points of damage + 2 points per caster level (maximum +30). A living target is sickened for 1 round per caster level (maximum 15 rounds) if it fails its saving throw.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Invisibility</h2>\n<p>The invisible target can't be detected with detect magic or other spells that detect magic auras. The invisibility can't be penetrated, revealed, or dispelled by spells of 2nd level or lower (such as see invisibility or glitterdust), though true seeing and dust of appearance can reveal the invisible target's presence.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the invisible target is undetectable by blindsense, blindsight, scent, and tremorsense.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Irresistible Dance</h2>\n<p>When casting the spell, you can choose to make the dance either an unending dance or a dance of death.</p>\n<p>A target affected by unending dance receives a new saving throw at the end of each round of dancing, even if its initial save was successful. If the save fails, the duration of the spell increases by 1 round.</p>\n<p>A target affected by the dance of death suffers excruciating pain that inflicts a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks, and it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round it spends dancing.</p>\n<p>With either form, you can direct the creature like a marionette as a move action, causing it to take a single move action at half its speed along the path you specify. You must have line of sight to the target and be within Medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) to command its movement. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, and doesn't count against the target's movement on its turn. You can't move a target that succeeded at its initial save against the spell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Jitterbugs</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Race Guide</p>\n<p>Starting on the second round of the spell, the affected target must succeed at a Fortitude save on your turn or be nauseated for 1 round, as if distracted by an actual swarm.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Knock</h2>\n<p>The spell unlocks up to three means of closure instead of two. The spell automatically opens locks of simple or average quality, without requiring a caster level check to do so). If used on a door locked with arcane lock, you can attempt a free dispel check against it as if using a targeted dispel magic, adding your tier to the check.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> You can expend two uses of mythic power to target one locked item per tier, unlocking up to four means of closure on each, allowing a free dispel against an arcane lock on each, and automatically opening locks of up to good quality (no caster level check needed).</p>\n<p>If the door has a trap that triggers when opened, you become aware of the trap and its general nature, and the door is unlocked but doesn't automatically open.</p>\n<p>The spell can raise a barred gate, portcullis, or similar impediment, but each one counts as two locked doors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Know The Enemy</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>The insight bonus increases to +15 plus your tier. If the check is successful, you gain a +5 insight bonus on your next attack roll or saving throw against a creature of that type, as long as the roll occurs within 24 hours of casting the spell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Lend Path</h2>\n<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> bard 4, cleric 5, druid 5, magus 4, sorcerer/wizard 5, summoner 4, witch 5</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>\n<p><strong>Range</strong> touch</p>\n<p><strong>Target</strong> creature touched</p>\n<p><strong>Duration</strong> 10 minutes/level (D)</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>\n<p>You temporarily transfer one of your mythic path abilities to another creature, which can use it as if it were part of the creature's own path. If the target is unable to expend mythic power, it can't activate any part of the ability that requires expending uses of mythic power, but the ability otherwise functions as if the creature were 1st tier.</p>\n<p>While your path ability is transferred in this way, you can't use it yourself (even if it's an automatic ability or one that doesn't require expending uses of mythic power).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Levitate</h2>\n<p>Instead of affecting one creature, you can affect a number of targets up to your caster level, but the total weight supported can be no more than 100 pounds per caster level. You can spend a move action to mentally direct all targets, but you must move all of them identically.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (8th):</strong> If you expend 10 uses of mythic power, you permanently levitate a 5-foot cube of rock, which you can move 20 feet vertically or horizontally as a move action.</p>\n<p>If you have created multiple cubes and they are physically touching each other, you can direct them all as a single move action (as if they were one object), even if some of them are out of range. Each levitating cube can support approximately 1,000 pounds of weight, allowing you to use it as a portion of the foundation for a bridge, floating castle, or similar construction project.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Lightning Arc</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>The damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 15d8). A target that fails its save is blinded by the flash for 1 round and deafened by thunder for 1d4 rounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (6th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the two targets can be up to 120 feet apart, the lightning can turn once up to 90 degrees to connect the targets, and the spell's electrical damage bypasses electricity resistance and electricity immunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Lightning Bolt</h2>\n<p>The damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 10d8). Any creature that fails its save is staggered for 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can bend the line of the spell once up to 90 degrees. Any creature that fails its save is stunned for 1 round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Limited Wish</h2>\n<p>When using mythic limited wish to duplicate another spell, you can duplicate a mythic spell you know (if you're a spontaneous caster) or have prepared (if you're a caster who prepares spells). If you don't know or haven't prepared the mythic spell, you can expend a second use of mythic power duplicate the mythic version of the desired spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented:</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can cast a silent, stilled mythic limited wish, even if you're helpless or couldn't otherwise take actions (but not unconscious).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Mage Armor</h2>\n<p>The armor bonus increases to +6. There is a 50% chance that any critical hit or sneak attack made against the target is negated and treated as a normal hit, as if the target were wearing moderate fortification armor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Mage's Disjunction</h2>\n<p>The duration increases to 10 minutes per caster level. The chance to destroy an antimagic field increases to 2% per caster level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Magic Fang</h2>\n<p>The spell affects an additional number of the target's natural weapons equal to your tier. For example, if you're 3rd tier, it could affect two claws and one bite).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Magic Fang, Greater</h2>\n<p>This functions like mythic magic fang. You can add one of the following weapon special abilities to natural attacks or unarmed strikes affected by the spell: flaming, frost, keen, merciful, shock, or thundering. You must choose only one with each casting of the spell. For example, you can't add flaming to a tiger's bite and keen to its claws with the same casting. If the target has an Intelligence score less than 3, these abilities are always on (the target can't activate or deactivate the effect) and it might react with fear if its attacks make noise or create visible energy.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (5th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can reduce the granted enhancement bonuses by 1 to add two of the above abilities or one of the following abilities: flaming burst, icy burst, or shocking burst.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Magic Missile</h2>\n<p>The damage dealt by each missile increases to 2d4+1. The missiles bypass the shield spell and similar effects that block the non-mythic version of this spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (4th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell creates double the normal number of missiles (affecting up to 10 creatures), its range increases to line of sight, and it bypasses the targets' spell resistance and spell immunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Magic Vestment</h2>\n<p>You can add one armor special ability to the target if it's armor or one shield special ability if it's a shield. The special ability must have a base price modifier no greater than a +1 enhancement bonus or 4,000 gp.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can add any number of special abilities with a total base price modifier no greater than a +2 enhancement bonus or 15,000 gp.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Magic Weapon, Greater</h2>\n<p>You can add one of the following weapon special abilities to the weapon: flaming, frost, keen, merciful, shock, or thundering.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (5th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can reduce the granted enhancement bonus by 1 to add two of the above abilities or one of the following abilities: anarchic, axiomatic, flaming burst, holy, icy burst, shocking burst, or unholy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Make Whole</h2>\n<p>The damage the spell repairs increases to 2d6 points of damage per caster level when cast on a construct creature (maximum 10d6). A construct repaired with this spell gains a +2 enhancement bonus on an ability score of your choice for the next 24 hours. To repair a magic item, your caster level has to equal to only the caster level of the magic item, not double the caster level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Maze</h2>\n<p>A spectral minotaur hunts the target trapped in the maze. Every round the creature fails to escape from the maze, it takes 2d8 + your tier points of piercing and slashing damage from this phantom opponent.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Memory Lapse</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>The target forgets an additional round, back to the beginning of the turn before its last turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can spend 1 round implanting a false memory in the affected target. This false memory is limited to events that could have occurred during the time it just forgot, as if using modify memory but limited to that short period of time. For example, you couldn't implant the memory of a lengthy conversation, as that couldn't happen in the forgotten length of time.</p>\n<p>The target can attempt a Will saving throw (DC equal to the mythic memory lapse DC plus your tier) to resist this implanted memory. Success means no memory is implanted, but the target still forgets the allotted time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Meteor Swarm</h2>\n<p>The meteors created by this spell deal bludgeoning damage in a line extending from you to the target destination where it explodes. Creatures in the path of a meteor take 2d10 points of bludgeoning damage and must succeed at a Fortitude save or be knocked prone. The damage from the exploding meteors increases to 6d10 points of fire damage. Creatures that fail their Reflex saves against the fire damage are also knocked prone and deafened for 1d4 rounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (10th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, creatures in the path of a meteor also take 4d10 points of fire damage and the damage from the exploding meteors increases to 10d10 points of fire damage; this fire damage bypasses fire resistance and fire immunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Mighty Fist Of The Earth</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Race Guide</p>\n<p>Add your tier to the rock's attack roll and damage roll. Increase the critical multiplier of the attack by 1 (maximum &times;4).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Mirror Image</h2>\n<p>The maximum number of images generated by this spell increases to 12. Destroying an image creates a flash of light. Any creature that destroys an image must succeed at a Will save or be dazzled for 1 round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Mislead</h2>\n<p>You create one illusory double per 5 caster levels, each of which appears in your square or in an unoccupied square adjacent to yours. When you cast the spell, you can give each of these doubles a simple programmed task as a telepathic command, such a \\\"walk south,\\\" \\\"beg for mercy,\\\" or \\\"follow that troll.\\\"</p>\n<p>You can change or modify a single illusory double's programmed task by spending a swift, move, or standard action; this requires concentration.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (4th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, this spell also grants you the benefits of augmented mythic invisibility instead of greater invisibility.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Modify Memory</h2>\n<p>You can modify an additional 5 minutes of the subject's memory per tier. You may affect multiple memories with one casting of the spell, as long as the total number of minutes doesn't exceed this limit. Each affected memory counts as a minimum of 5 minutes. For example, you could implant a memory of having a brief meeting with the mayor before lunch and another brief meeting just after dinner, even though the two events would have been hours apart.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (8th):</strong> If you expend four uses of mythic power, instead of altering the target's memories, you alter all other creatures' memories of the target (only the target gets a saving throw against the spell). All creatures on the same plane as the target forget his name, their relationship to him, and everything he has done; he is essentially a stranger to them. Any important acts by the target are attributed to someone else. Everyone's memories of history are rewritten to incorporate this change. The target's memories are unaffected. You can exclude a number of other creatures up to your tier from the effects of this spell (so they remember the truth), including yourself if you wish. Written records are unchanged unless you expend an additional six uses of mythic power when you cast the spell, and written records on other planes remain unchanged regardless.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Monstrous Physique (All)</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>Each mythic monstrous physique spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic monstrous physique spell to learn its mythic version. You don't have to learn them in order, and aren't required to know a lower-level mythic monstrous physique spell before you learn a higher-level one (for example, you can learn mythic monstrous physique II if you know monstrous physique II, even if you don't know mythic monstrous physique I). Each mythic monstrous physique spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version.</p>\n<p>The spell's bonuses to ability scores increase by 2 each, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the ability score penalties decrease by 2 each (minimum penalty of 0). Alternatively, you can cast this spell on another willing creature, changing the range to touch and the target to one creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (4th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. Additionally, you can cast this spell on other willing creatures, changing the range to touch and the target to one creature per tier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Move Earth</h2>\n<p>This spell can move earth much more quickly, with each full round of casting allowing you to reshape a 25-foot-square area up to 10 feet deep. All creatures on or under the ground within that area are knocked prone and moved to the closest square outside the area being shaped. A successful Reflex save prevents a creature from being knocked prone, but it's still moved.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Murderous Command</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>This spell lasts for a number of rounds equal to your tier. Each round after the first, the target can attempt a new saving throw at the beginning of its turn to break free of the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented:</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target attacks its nearest ally with its most powerful spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability. If it has no such ability, it attacks the ally with a melee weapon or natural weapon as normal and gains a +4 morale bonus on the attack and damage rolls.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Mythic Severance</h2>\n<p><strong>School</strong> necromancy [curse]; <strong>Level</strong> cleric 4, inquisitor 3, sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 4</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>\n<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>\n<p><strong>Target</strong> one creature</p>\n<p><strong>Duration</strong> permanent</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>\n<p>You restrict the target's access to its mythic power. Each time the target attempts to cast a mythic spell, expend mythic power to activate a path ability, or use any other effect that requires expending uses of mythic power, it must attempt a Will saving throw against the DC of this spell. If it fails this saving throw, the creature loses its action and the ability it was attempting to use has no effect.</p>\n<p>This spell has no effect on mythic abilities that don't require the target to expend mythic power.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Named Bullet</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Combat</p>\n<p>Increase the critical multiplier of the target weapon by 1 (maximum &times;4).</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (2nd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target ammunition or weapon returns to the creature that shot or threw it just before that creature's next turn (similar to a returning weapon). The spell isn't discharged until the target is used to attempt a second attack against the named creature. Ammunition that hits is destroyed and doesn't return.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>New Spells</h2>\n<p>The following are new spells that affect the mythic rules or mythic creatures in some way. Unlike the mythic spells presented earlier in this chapter, you don't need a mythic tier to cast most of these spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic:</strong> Some of these spells have mythic versions just as preexisting spells like animate dead and fireball do. Rather than listing the information for the mythic version in the earlier section of this chapter, it's included in the new spell's description.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented:</strong> As with the mythic spell entries, if a spell has an augmented version, it's listed in the spell description.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Nightmare</h2>\n<p>The spell's damage increases to 4d6 points of damage, and the target is also shaken for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (6th):</strong> You can deliver a mind-affecting spell through a mythic nightmare. The maximum level of the delivered spell is equal to half your tier, and you must expend one use of mythic power for each spell level of the imbued spell in addition to the one use needed to cast mythic nightmare. You choose whether the delivered spell affects the creature immediately or when it awakens. The delivered spell affects only the target, even if it normally affects multiple creatures or an area.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Oath Of Peace</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>You don't provoke attacks of opportunity when you attempt Heal checks, cast targeted spells with the harmless descriptor, or use positive energy effects to heal living creatures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Obscuring Mist</h2>\n<p>The range increases to 50 feet, and the cloud's radius and height both increase to 50 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the range increases to 500 feet. The cloud's radius increases to 500 feet, and its height increases to 100 feet. Winds can't dissipate the mist unless the area of the wind affects the entire area of this spell. Areas of mist burned away by fire spells become obscured again 1d4 rounds after the fire effect ends.</p>\n<p>If you're at least 6th tier and expend three uses of mythic power, the range increases to 1 mile, the cloud radius increases to 1 mile, and its height increases to 500 feet. The cloud is as resistant to wind and fire effects as the 3rd-tier version.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Orb Of The Void</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>A creature that fails its save against the orb gains 2 negative levels rather than 1. A successful Fortitude save reduces this to 1 negative level.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (6th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the orb doesn't automatically stop when in enters a space with a living creature, but the saving throw DC decreases by 2 for each creature after the first it affects each round.</p>\n<p>An individual creature can be affected by the orb of the void only once per round, even if the orb moves through its space more than once.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Order's Wrath</h2>\n<p>The damage dealt to chaotic outsiders increases to 1d10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d10) and the damage to other chaotic creatures increases to 1d12 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d12). The duration that creatures in the area are dazed increases to 2 rounds. Chaotic creatures that succeed at their saves are dazed for 1 round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Pernicious Poison</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>The number of successful saving throws needed to cure a poison increases by one. If the poison deals ability damage on a failed saving throw, that ability damage increases by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (6th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target's penalty on saves against poison increases to -8, and the penalty for attempting to cure the target with skill or magic increases to -8.</p>\n<p>If you expend three uses of mythic power, the poison bypasses the creature's poison immunity (this doesn't affect poison immunity from not having a Constitution score).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Phantasmal Killer</h2>\n<p>If the target fails its Will save but succeeds at its Fortitude save, the phantasmal killer persists in the target's mind, giving it the dazed condition until your next turn. On your next turn, the target must attempt another Fortitude save against the phantasm. Success means it takes 3d6 points of damage; failure means it dies from fear.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (6th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell can affect a living target that is immune to fear, illusions, or mind-affecting effects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Phantom Steed</h2>\n<p>The steed's rider automatically succeeds at Ride checks to remain mounted. The mount's hit points increase to 10 plus 2 per caster level, and its speed increases to 30 feet per 2 caster levels (maximum 150 feet).</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the phantom steed is incorporeal, but its rider can interact with it normally.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Pillar Of Life</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>The damage healed increases to 3d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20). The damage dealt to undead increases to 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d8), or 2d6 points of damage per caster level for undead vulnerable to bright light (maximum 20d6). If a dead creature is brought into the pillar's square and that creature could be revived by breath of life, the pillar of life ends and the creature returns to life as per breath of life.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Plane Shift</h2>\n<p>If you've been to the destination plane and are familiar with a location there, you may choose that location and arrive on target at that location with anyone else you transport with the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented:</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, you grant transported creatures the effects of a planar adaptation spell (Advanced Player's Guide 236) upon arrival, lasting for 1 hour.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Polar Ray</h2>\n<p>The damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 25d8) and 1d6 points of Dexterity drain. If the target takes damage from this spell, it becomes partially encased in ice, reducing its speed by half. Creatures with the cold or incorporeal subtypes or immunity to being grappled are immune to this effect. The reduced movement lasts until the ice is destroyed. Destroying the ice requires a successful Strength or dispel check against the spell's DC or dealing 1 point of bludgeoning or fire damage per caster level to the target.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Power Word Blind</h2>\n<p>Treat the target's current hit point total as though it were lowered by 5 times your tier. For example, a 3rd-tier archmage casting mythic power word blind would affect a creature with 60 hp as though it had 45 hp, and the spell would permanently blind the target.</p>\n<p>You can target a creature with more hit points than this spell could normally affect, causing it to treat all opponents as though they had concealment (20% miss chance) for 1d4 rounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the magic of the word lingers around the target. Until the beginning of your next turn, if the target's hit points are reduced enough to put it in a lower category for the spell's effects, the spell affects the creature according to its new hit point total. For example, a creature in the 101-200 hp category reduced to 80 hp immediately becomes blinded for 1d4+1 minutes instead of 1d4+1 rounds. The spell's effects don't diminish if the target regains hit points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Power Word Kill</h2>\n<p>Treat the target's current hit point total as though it were lowered by 5 times your tier. For example, a 3rd-tier archmage casting mythic power word kill would instantly kill a creature with 85 hit points or fewer.</p>\n<p>You can target a creature with more hit points than this spell could normally affect, causing it to become exhausted.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (6th):</strong> If you expend four uses of mythic power, the magic of the word lingers around the target. Until the beginning of your next turn, if the target's hit point total drops to the point that this spell would have killed it upon casting, it's instantly slain.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Power Word Stun</h2>\n<p>Treat the target's current hit point total as though it were lowered by 5 times your tier. For example, a 3rd-tier archmage casting this spell would affect a creature with 60 hp as though it had 45 hp, and the spell would last an additional 2d4 rounds.</p>\n<p>You can target a creature with more hit points than this spell could normally affect, causing it to become dazed for 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (6th):</strong> If you expend three uses of mythic power, the magic of the word lingers around the target. Until the beginning of your next turn, if the target's hit points are reduced enough to put it in a lower category for the spell's effects, the spell affects the creature according to its new hit point total. For example, a creature in the 101-150 hp category reduced to 80 hp is immediately stunned for an additional 1d4 rounds. The spell's effects don't diminish if the target regains hit points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Pox Pustules</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>The Dexterity penalty increases to -6. The target takes 1 point of bleed damage each round. If the target spends a move action scratching, increase its bleed damage each round by 1. If the bleeding is stopped, scratching causes it to start again at 1 point of bleed per round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Prayer</h2>\n<p>The spell's luck bonus increases to +2, and the penalty for enemies changes to -2. When you cast the spell, your affected allies heal an amount of hit point damage equal to double your tier, and affected enemies take an amount of damage equal to double your tier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Prismatic Sphere</h2>\n<p>When you cast the spell, you simultaneously create a prismatic spray that originates from one point on the sphere and radiates directly away from you. The save DC of this prismatic spray is the same as that of your mythic prismatic sphere.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Prismatic Spray</h2>\n<p>The spell automatically blinds creatures with up to 12 Hit Dice instead of 8 Hit Dice. Attempt one bull rush combat maneuver and apply its results to each creature in the area. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (6th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the area changes from a cone into a line. Creatures in the line are struck by two beams (or three, if the creature rolls an 8 on the table). The spell bypasses energy resistance and immunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Protection From Arrows</h2>\n<p>The damage reduction increases to 15/magic. The maximum damage prevented by the spell increases to 15 points per caster level (maximum 150 points). If the spell prevents all damage from a ranged weapon attack, it turns the projectile or weapon back on the attacker, using the same attack roll result. If the attacker is also protected by mythic protection from arrows and its spell completely prevents the damage from the rebounded attack, the weapon or projectile is destroyed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Protection From Chaos</h2>\n<p>As mythic protection from evil, except against chaotic creatures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Protection From Evil</h2>\n<p>The bonuses to AC and on saves increase to +4. Any evil creature attempting to possess or exercise mental control over the target must attempt a Will save against this spell. If it fails, the creature takes 1d6 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d6) from mental feedback. An evil creature that uses spell resistance to bypass the spell's protection against contact must successfully save or take this damage once each round it attacks the protected target.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Protection From Good</h2>\n<p>As mythic protection from evil, except against good creatures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Protection From Law</h2>\n<p>As mythic protection from evil, except against lawful creatures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ray Of Enfeeblement</h2>\n<p>The Strength penalty increases to 1d8 + 1 per 2 caster levels (maximum +10). If the target fails its save, it's fatigued.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Reduce Person</h2>\n<p>You can decrease the target's size by up to two categories, to a minimum of Tiny. If the target shrinks two sizes, its weight decreases by a factor of 16 and it gains a +4 size bonus to Dexterity, a -4 size penalty to Strength, and a +2 bonus on attack rolls and to AC because of its decreased size. A Medium or Small humanoid creature whose size decreases to Tiny has a space of 2-1/2 feet and a natural reach of 0 feet.</p>\n<p>Mythic reduce person counters and dispels mythic enlarge person.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Regenerate</h2>\n<p>The casting time changes to 1 standard action and the target changes to 1 living creature or corpse touched. The spell removes the blinded, dazzled, and deafened conditions. The target gains regeneration equal to your tier (overcome by acid and fire) for 1 round per caster level. If the target was killed by amputation or decapitation (such as from a vorpal weapon) within the past 1 round, the spell regenerates lost body parts and brings the creature back to life (as breath of life), treating it as if it had negative hp equal to its Constitution score.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Repel Wood</h2>\n<p>The casting time changes to 1 immediate action. You may cause one affected wooden object up to 5 inches in diameter to splinter and break.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the area changes to a 60-foot, cone-shaped emanation from you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Resist Energy</h2>\n<p>The target gains a +4 bonus on saves against effects that deal damage of the selected energy type. Once each round as a free action, the target can choose one adjacent ally to gain energy resistance 5 against the chosen energy type for 1 round. This increases to energy resistance 10 at caster level 7 and energy resistance 15 at caster level 11.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Resonating Word</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>The damage dealt increases to 8d6 points on the 1st and 2nd rounds and 15d6 on the 3rd round. The target takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against all sonic effects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Restore Mythic Power</h2>\n<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> bard 3, cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>\n<p><strong>Range</strong> touch</p>\n<p><strong>Targets</strong> you and one mythic creature</p>\n<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>\n<p>By laying your hands on the target, you're able to transfer some of your mythic essence to the target. You expend three uses of your mythic power to restore one use of the target's mythic power.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Reverse Gravity</h2>\n<p>Creatures in the area or that enter the area must succeed at a Fortitude save or be nauseated.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (8th):</strong> If you expend three uses of mythic power, once per round as a move action you may select one secured creature (one that succeeded at its Reflex save) or attached object (such as a tree or cottage) and force it to attempt a Fortitude save against the spell. The selected creature or object can weigh no more than 100 pounds per caster level. If it fails the save, it's pulled free and falls upward.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ricochet Shot</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Combat</p>\n<p>If the attack hits the secondary target, the wielder can select a tertiary target within 20 feet of the secondary target. This functions like a ricochet off the primary target. The tertiary target must be a different creature than the primary target.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the secondary and tertiary attacks gain the enhancement bonus and magic qualities of the attack against the primary target.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sacred Bond</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>The range at which you and the target can cast conjuration (healing) spells on each other increases to medium (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level). When you or the target uses the sacred bond to cast a healing spell on the other, the caster also heals a number of hit points equal to the minimum amount the spell can heal.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (6th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, casting a healing spell through the link heals the caster the normal amount instead of the minimum amount.</p>\n<p>You and the target can use the link to heal each other with targeted healing abilities such as lay on hands. Unlike with healing spells, a character using a healing ability in this way doesn't heal herself.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sanctify Armor</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>You gain DR 5/evil while wearing the target armor. While you're using your judgment or smite ability, this improves to DR 10/evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, when you use judgment or smite, add half your tier to your AC as a sacred bonus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sanctuary</h2>\n<p>If an attacker succeeds at its Will save to attack the protected target, add your tier to the target's AC against the attack. If the target uses a healing spell or ability on another creature, that creature gains the benefit of non-mythic sanctuary for 1 round. If the creature breaks the non-mythic sanctuary by attacking, subsequent healing by the target doesn't create another non-mythic sanctuary effect on the creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (2nd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, select a number of additional creatures equal to half your tier that are within reach. These creatures gain the benefit of non-mythic sanctuary.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sands Of Time</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>You age the target by two categories instead of one. The damage dealt to objects, constructs, and undead increases to 5d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20).</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (8th):</strong> If you expend four uses of mythic power, the duration changes to instantaneous. If the target is a living creature, its age increases to venerable, regardless of its current age. A non-mythic creature receives no saving throw against this, but a mythic creature can attempt a Fortitude save against the spell's DC to reduce the duration to 10 minutes per level and the effect to two age categories instead of automatically changing to venerable.</p>\n<p>If the target is an object, construct, or undead, it takes 30 points of damage per caster level. A mythic creature that succeeds at a Fortitude takes only half damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Saving Finale</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>Add your tier as a bonus on the saving throw reroll.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Scorching Ash Form</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Race Guide</p>\n<p>The damage dealt increases to 3d6 points of fire damage. This otherwise makes the same changes as mythic gaseous form.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented:</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target can shift into or out of scorching ash form as a move action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Scorching Ray</h2>\n<p>Each ray's damage increases to 6d6 points of fire damage. The first ray bypasses fire resistance and immunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Scouring Winds</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>The spell's damage increases to 4d8 points of piercing damage. Any creature in the area at the start of your turn must succeed at a Reflex save or be blinded for as long as it remains in the area and for 1d4 rounds after it leaves.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (5th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the sandstorm's radius and height each increase to 40 feet, and the damage dealt increases to 6d8 points of piercing damage. Each round, you can either move the storm up to 50 feet as a move action or up to 10 feet as a swift action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Searing Light</h2>\n<p>The spell's damage increases to 1d6 per caster level (maximum 10d6). The damage dealt to an undead creature increases to 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d8), or 2d6 per caster level (maximum 20d6) if the undead is vulnerable to bright light. The damage dealt to constructs increases to 1d8 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d8). If a creature struck has light sensitivity or light blindness, it takes the penalty from that weakness for 1 round after being struck by the light.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sending</h2>\n<p>You can contact a number of additional creatures equal to your tier. Each creature must receive the same message, and can communicate back only to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (3rd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can send the message to unfamiliar creatures (using the same number of creatures as non-augmented mythic sending). You must either describe the intended recipients in general or specific terms (such as \\\"orcs,\\\" \\\"the queen of this country,\\\" or \\\"left-handed half-elven males\\\") or specify restrictions such as range, creature type, and alignment (such as \\\"all good-aligned humanoids in the castle on the hill\\\"). If a greater number of creatures meet your description than the maximum number you can send to, the closest ones to you receive the message.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shadow Anchor</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Race Guide</p>\n<p>Add your tier to the CMD of the shadow tether. A creature attempting to escape the shadow tether using planar travel or teleportation must succeed at a Will saving throw or be shunted to the Plane of Shadow instead of its intended destination, as if it had cast shadow walk (if the target could not reach the Shadow Plane from its current location using shadow walk, this aspect of the spell has no effect).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shadow Weapon</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>Add your tier to your caster level when determining what enhancement bonus or weapon special abilities the weapon can have. The weapon deals half damage to creatures that disbelieve in it and to objects, instead of only 1 point.</p>\n<p>You can spend a swift action to transform the weapon into a dull black metal ring on your finger, or to return it from its ring form to its weapon form in your hand.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Share Glory</h2>\n<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> bard 2, cleric 3, druid 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 2, witch 3</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>\n<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>\n<p><strong>Target</strong> one non-mythic creature/3 levels</p>\n<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 minute/level</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes (harmless)</p>\n<p>You imbue the targets with a fraction of your mythic nature. They count as mythic creatures for the purpose of path abilities, spells, and other effects that function differently for mythic creatures. This doesn't grant the targets mythic tiers or any uses of mythic power; it merely gives them a greater advantage when others use abilities that work differently for mythic creatures. You must be at least a 1st-tier mythic character to cast this spell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shatter</h2>\n<p>Add your tier to your caster level when determining the maximum object weight you can affect. When targeting a crystalline creature, the spell's damage increases to 1d8 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d8). You may damage a single magical object as if it were a crystalline creature. If the spell destroys an object or damages a crystalline creature, broken shards litter the spell area or creature's space and act as caltrops.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shield Of Faith</h2>\n<p>Add half your tier to the spell's deflection bonus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shield Other</h2>\n<p>Increase the range to long (400 feet + 40 feet per caster level). Subtract your tier from any damage transmitted to you through the mystical connection before applying the damage (minimum 1 hp of damage). When you use your surge ability to modify a saving throw against an effect that also affects your linked ally, the ally also applies your surge bonus die result to the ally's saving throw. If the ally also uses its own surge ability, it takes either your result or its result, whichever is higher.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shocking Grasp</h2>\n<p>The spell's damage increases to 1d8 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 5d8). If the target is wearing metal armor or is made of metal, you may attempt a free grapple combat maneuver against the target.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if the target is carrying a metal weapon, you may attempt a free disarm combat maneuver against that weapon. This free combat maneuver doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented:</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power and the free grapple or disarm combat maneuver is successful, the target is staggered until your next turn. This is an electricity effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shout</h2>\n<p>The duration that creatures in the area are deafened increases to 4d6 rounds, and the damage dealt increases to 5d8 points of sonic damage. The damage dealt to crystalline creatures and exposed brittle or crystalline objects increases to 1d8 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 15d8). Crystalline creatures reverberate with sonic energy, taking 4 points of sonic damage on your turn for a number of rounds equal to your tier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Silence</h2>\n<p>This spell also applies to telepathy, cutting off any mental communication within the area. At the time of casting, you can choose to be immune to your own mythic silence effect and can designate up to one creature per tier to also gain this immunity. Creatures immune to the mythic silence are subject to sonic effects as normal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Silent Image</h2>\n<p>The duration increases to concentration + 1 round per caster level, and the effect increases to a visual figment that can't extend beyond eight 10-foot cubes + 1 10-foot cube per caster level.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (6th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the duration changes to concentration + 1 minute per caster level and the effect changes to a visual figment no larger than a 50-foot emanation. An augmented mythic silent image can't move.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sleep</h2>\n<p>The spell affects up to 8 Hit Dice of creatures, and you can choose the order in which creatures are affected by the spell. Any effect that would automatically awaken a sleeping creature instead allows it to attempt a new Will saving throw to awaken.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (8th):</strong> If you expend three uses of mythic power, you can target all living creatures other than you that have 8 Hit Dice or fewer in a 1-mile radius centered on you. Creatures that fail their saving throws fall asleep for a number of days equal to your tier. You can select a number of creatures up to your tier to not be affected by the spell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Slow</h2>\n<p>The penalty on attack rolls, on Reflex saves, and to AC increases to -2, and affected creatures move at one-fourth speed. Select one affected creature; this creature is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Solid Fog</h2>\n<p>The penalty on melee attack and damage rolls increases to -4. The cloud's radius and height both increase to 50 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented:</strong> The augmented version of mythic solid fog has the same additional benefits as the augmented version of mythic fog cloud.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spider Climb</h2>\n<p>The target gains a climb speed equal to its base land speed or 30 feet, whichever is higher. The target can take the run action while climbing and needs only one hand free to climb.</p>\n<p>The target can move freely across spider webs (including giant spider webs), web spells, and similar adhesives of 2nd level or less (including tanglefoot bags) as if it were using freedom of movement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spike Stones</h2>\n<p>The damage dealt increases to 2d6 points of piercing damage plus 1 point of bleed damage. Add your tier to the DC to detect the magical trap.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spiritual Weapon</h2>\n<p>The weapon gains your choice of one of the following magic weapon special abilities: flaming, frost, keen, merciful, shock, or thundering. Before or after the weapon attempts all of its attacks for the round, you can redirect it to a different target as a swift action instead of a move action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Steal Power</h2>\n<p><strong>School</strong> necromancy; <strong>Level</strong> cleric 5, sorcerer/wizard 5, witch 5</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S</p>\n<p><strong>Range</strong> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>\n<p><strong>Target</strong> one mythic creature</p>\n<p><strong>Duration</strong> instantaneous</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> yes</p>\n<p>You sap the power from a mythic creature, using it to restore your own. The target loses 1d4 uses of mythic power. If you have the ability to expend mythic power, you regain one use for each use the target loses.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Stinking Cloud</h2>\n<p>Creatures that succeed at their saves are sickened while they remain in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after they leave. Creatures that fail their saves continue to be sickened for 1 hour after leaving the cloud.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Stone Shape</h2>\n<p>The duration changes to 1 round/level and instantaneous (see text). Each round after the round you cast the spell, you can spend a standard action to shape up to 5 additional cubic feet of stone you touch. Shaped stone has an instantaneous duration (meaning it does not revert to its previous form when the spell ends).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Stoneskin</h2>\n<p>The target gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against disease, poison, and stun effects. There is a 50% chance any critical hit or sneak attack against the target is treated as a normal hit, as if the target were wearing medium fortification armor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Storm Of Vengeance</h2>\n<p>The acid damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of acid damage. The lightning damage dealt increases to 10d8 points of electricity damage. You can call down a bolt of lightning on the 2nd and 4th rounds (equivalent to those on the 3rd round). You can strike the same target with a bolt more than once during the casting of the spell, but not more than once per round.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (7th):</strong> If you expend three uses of mythic power, the storm cloud's radius increases to 1,000 feet. Structures in the storm take 1d10 points of damage per round (this damage bypasses hardness). You can call down one additional bolt in the 2nd and 4th rounds, and three additional bolts in the 3rd round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Strangling Hair</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>You may use your hair to attempt dirty trick, disarm, steal, or trip combat maneuvers instead of grapple combat maneuvers. Add your tier to combat maneuver checks attempted with your hair and to your hair's damage rolls made as part of a grapple.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Suggestion</h2>\n<p>Mythic suggestion loses the language-dependent descriptor, and can target one or more living creatures in a 10-foot-radius burst.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Summon Swarm</h2>\n<p>The swarm has the advanced simple template. A swarm of rats or spiders leaves behind a trail of filth or ichor when it moves, which has the effects of a grease spell for 1 round after the swarm passes through an area. Any creature that moves through the affected area is also subject to the swarm's disease or poison, as if attacked by the swarm. A prone creature in the affected area takes a -4 penalty on its saving throw against this affliction. A bat swarm leaves behind a similar trail that lasts for 2 rounds but doesn't have a disease or poison effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sun Metal</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Combat</p>\n<p>The additional damage dealt by the weapon increases to 1d6 points of fire damage. Any creature struck by the weapon is dazzled for 1 round (no saving throw). On a critical hit, the target is blinded for 1 round (Fortitude negates, DC equal to the DC of the spell).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sunbeam</h2>\n<p>You call forth one beam per 2 caster levels instead of per 3. The damage dealt increases to 4d8 points of damage. The damage dealt to undead creatures, fungi, mold, oozes, and slimes increases to 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d8). Any creature that successfully saves against a beam is dazzled for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (9th):</strong> If you expend three uses of mythic power, the first beam you create has a duration of 1 round per 2 caster levels, and deals maximum damage on the round you cast it. Creatures in the beam can attempt saving throws to avoid blindness, but not the spell's damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Surmount Affliction</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>You can cast this spell with no verbal or somatic component, and even if you're helpless (but not unconscious). You temporarily overcome a number of additional harmful conditions equal to half your tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (7th):</strong> If you expend three uses of mythic power, you become immune to all afflictions the spell can normally overcome. In addition, you overcome (but do not become immune to) one of the following conditions: exhausted, nauseated, panicked, petrified, staggered, and stunned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Telekinesis</h2>\n<p>The duration of this spell changes to 1 round per level. You may spend a move action to use the sustained force or combat maneuver effects of the spell.</p>\n<p>When using sustained force, you can move a number of objects up to your tier. These must be in the same square and together must weigh no more than the weight limit of the spell.</p>\n<p>Using the violent thrust effect ends the spell, but the weight restriction increases to 50 pounds per caster level (maximum 750 pounds).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Terraform</h2>\n<p><strong>School</strong> transmutation; <strong>Level</strong> cleric 7, druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 7, witch 7</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time</strong> 1 hour</p>\n<p><strong>Components</strong> V, S, M (10,000 gp worth of precious minerals, see text)</p>\n<p><strong>Range</strong> 100 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Area</strong> 100-foot-radius emanation, centered on you</p>\n<p><strong>Duration</strong> 1 day/level (see text)</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> none; <strong>Spell Resistance</strong> no</p>\n<p>You alter the area's terrain and climate to a new terrain and climate type appropriate to the planet or plane. For example, you might transform a desert to plains. To cast this spell, you must expend 10 uses of mythic power along with the material cost. This magically alters the area's climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain, but doesn't affect creatures or the configuration of the earth. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees, but doesn't flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment.</p>\n<p>You can alter the climate by one step (warm, temperate, or cold). The maximum extent of the terrain change is up to the GM, but in general is to a similar terrain type or one step within that terrain type (such as from a typical forest to a forest with massive trees or light undergrowth, from a shallow bog to a deep bog, and so on). You might be able to shift the land to a similar terrain type, such as turning a sparse forest into a relatively dry swamp. Local creatures adversely affected by these alterations either flee the area or quickly die, depending on their mobility and awareness of the change.</p>\n<p>Multiple castings of the spell in the same area can create an area with radically different terrain and climate than the surrounding land. The GM can decide that certain terrain shifts are unsustainable and shorten the duration, or that some are suitable for the area and extend the duration.</p>\n<p>This spell could have many secondary effects based on the nature of the change, the type of bordering terrain, and so on; these should be determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis. For example, transforming a desert requires drawing water up from underground to sustain the plants, which could deplete the water table in nearby areas. Creating a warm desert in the middle of a snowy tundra will create a bordering area of mud and frequent storms from the clash of hot and cold air fronts.</p>\n<p>If you're at least 8th tier, you can expend 20 uses of mythic power instead of 10 to increase the range to 1 mile, the area to a 1-mile-radius emanation centered on you, and the duration to 1 month per caster level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Theft Ward</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Race Guide</p>\n<p>Add your tier to the Perception check bonus. Add your tier to your CMD against disarm and steal combat maneuvers attempted against the item.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Time Stop</h2>\n<p>Select a number of creatures equal to half your tier or fewer within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels). Mythic time stop has the same effect on these creatures as it does on you, allowing them to act for the same number of rounds of apparent time that you can. You and these creatures can all interact with one another normally while time appears to be stopped.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (10th):</strong> If you expend three uses of mythic power, the duration increases to 1 hour per level of apparent time. You and other affected creatures gain no benefit from rest or sleep while the spell is active.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Touch Injection</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Combat</p>\n<p>Add half your tier to the DC of a poison or potion you inject into another creature with this spell. If you do this with a substance that grants a skill bonus, add your tier to that skill bonus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Transformation</h2>\n<p>You can still cast spells and use spell completion and spell trigger items, but the level of the spell you're casting or using must be equal to or less than your tier. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your caster level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>True Form</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>The spell's target changes to up to one creature per 2 caster levels. If a target is a creature that has the ability to change shape between a specific set of forms (such as a barghest or lycanthrope), you may choose which form the creature takes. To force such a creature into a form, you must have either seen it in that form or succeeded at an appropriate Knowledge check to know the creature has the ability to take that form.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (6th):</strong> If you expend three uses of mythic power, the spell creates an area affecting all shapechanging creatures. The range changes to 30 feet and the spell affects all creatures in a 30-foot radius around you. Each creature must attempt a saving throw against the spell every round it remains in the area.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>True Strike</h2>\n<p>The affected attack bypasses all damage reduction.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (2nd):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, you gain a +10 insight bonus on your second attack that round and a +5 insight bonus on your third attack that round. The second and third attacks can be on your turn or on another creature's turn before your next turn (such as when you attempt an attack of opportunity).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Tsunami</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Player's Guide</p>\n<p>The wave increases to 20 feet wide per caster level and 3 feet tall per caster level. The damage dealt to those struck by the wave increases to 12d6 points of bludgeoning damage. Add your tier to the wave's special combat maneuver check. The damage dealt to those that fail to escape the wave increases to 6d8 points of bludgeoning damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (5th):</strong> If you expend three uses of mythic power, you create a truly monstrous wave. The wave increases to 20 feet deep, 20 feet wide per caster level, and 5 feet tall per caster level. The duration of the effect increases to 10 rounds, and the speed of the wave increases to 120 feet per round on the surface of the water and 60 feet per round on land or underwater.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Unholy Blight</h2>\n<p>The damage dealt to good outsiders increases to 1d10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d10) and the damage dealt to other good creatures increases to 1d12 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d12). The duration that creatures within the area are sickened increases to 2d4 rounds. On a successful save, a good creature is slowed for 1 round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Unshakable Chill</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Magic</p>\n<p>On a failed save, the target immediately takes 1d6 points of nonlethal cold damage per tier. Add your tier to the DC of any other Fortitude saves the target attempts to resist severe cold as part of the spell's effects. The target also takes a -4 penalty on saves against spells or effects with the cold descriptor.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (5th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target gains vulnerability to fire (Bestiary 305).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Vampiric Touch</h2>\n<p>The spell's damage increases to 1d8 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 10d8). Your melee touch attack to deliver the spell threatens a critical hit on a 19 or 20. This expanded threat range doesn't stack with other effects or abilities that increase the threat range. If the damage kills the target, you gain fast healing 5 for a number of rounds equal to the Hit Dice of the target.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Vomit Twin</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Advanced Race Guide</p>\n<p>Any spell you cast that has a range of touch, close, medium, or long can originate from the twin instead of you. The twin gains a deflection bonus to AC equal to your tier, and has hit points equal to double your caster level. The twin can attempt attacks of opportunity using your base attack bonus, but has no ability score modifiers, skills, or feats. It threatens an area appropriate for your size and wields a copy of the weapon you were wielding when you cast mythic vomit twin. If the twin's weapon is destroyed or disarmed, on your turn the twin generates a new weapon from its own substance. Its attacks deal damage using that weapon's die type.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (5th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, you create two copies when you cast the spell, and both can be active at the same time. If you instead expend three uses of mythic power, you create three copies when you cast the spell, and all three can be active at the same time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Walk Through Space</h2>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Ultimate Combat</p>\n<p>You can teleport as either a move action or a swift action, but never more than once per round. If you expend a move action and a swift action, you may teleport up to 60 feet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Wall Of Fire</h2>\n<p>The wall's damage increases to 2d6 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet, 1d6 points of fire damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet, and 2d8 points of fire damage + 1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20) to any creature passing through it. Any creature that passes through the wall or is within 5 feet of the wall when it's created must succeed at a Reflex save or catch fire. Attempts to extinguish this fire use the spell's save DC.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (5th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, you may move the wall 5 feet in any direction as a move action on your turn. Moving the wall into a fireproof barrier (such as a stone wall) destroys the part of the wall that overlaps the barrier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Wall Of Force</h2>\n<p>The wall's hardness increases to 40, and its hit points increase to 30 per caster level. A non-mythic disintegrate spell or rod of cancellation negates a 10-foot-square section of a mythic wall of force for 1 round, after which the wall reforms at full strength. One side of the wall (chosen by you) repels creatures within 5 feet as a repulsion spell (using the DC wall of force would have if it allowed a saving throw).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Wall Of Ice</h2>\n<p>The wall's hit points increase to 5 hit points per inch of thickness. Add your tier to the Strength check DC to break through the wall. The damage dealt to those that step through the wall increases to 1d8 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level. Any creature that passes through the wall must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered for 1d4 rounds; this is a cold effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (5th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, you cover the wall in sharp, protruding icicles. Any creature that touches, strikes, or breaks through the wall takes 1d6 points of cold damage, 1d6 points of piercing damage, and 1 point of bleed damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Wall Of Iron</h2>\n<p>The wall is 1 inch thick per 2 caster levels. If you create an unattached wall, you can weight it so there is a 75% chance it falls on its own in the direction you want. Subtract 5 from the DC to push it in the direction you want, and add 5 to the DC to push the wall in the other direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (7th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, one side of the wall (your choice) has a powerful magnetic charge that attracts metal within 10 feet. The wall automatically attempts a combat maneuver check to pull once per round against any creature that comes in range wearing metal armor, wielding a metal weapon, or otherwise carrying a significant amount of metal.</p>\n<p>The wall's CMB is equal to your caster level plus your tier. If the combat maneuver succeeds, the creature is pulled 5 feet closer to the wall. The wall gains a +5 bonus on its combat maneuver check if the creature is within 5 feet. If the wall succeeds at its check against a creature within 5 feet, the creature is pulled up against the wall and is treated as grappled.</p>\n<p>Dropping metal items or removing metal armor allows a creature to free itself from the wall. The magnetic charge fades after 1 hour per tier. Wrenching an item away from the wall requires a successful Strength check (DC 10 + the wall's CMB).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Wall Of Stone</h2>\n<p>The wall is 1 inch thick per 2 caster levels. The wall's hardness increases to 12.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (7th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the wall is impassable to ethereal travel and spells such as passwall and phase door. The wall is immune to non-mythic disintegrate, shatter, sympathetic vibration, and other non-mythic magical effects that specifically affect stone (including earthquake, soften earth and stone, and transmute rock to mud).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Wall Of Thorns</h2>\n<p>The damage dealt increases to 30 minus the creature's AC. Any creature adjacent to the wall is automatically grappled by it. Any creature that begins its turn grappled by the wall takes 2d6 points of damage. Half of this damage is bludgeoning, and the other half is piercing. For the purpose of escaping this grapple, the wall's CMD is 10 + your caster level + your tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (6th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the wall automatically grapples creatures other than you within 10 feet. Any creature grappled by the wall takes 2d6 points of bleed damage. If a creature doesn't escape the wall's grapple, on its next turn the wall automatically pins it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Web</h2>\n<p>The webs are filled with spider swarms (one spider swarm for each 10-foot-by-10-foot area covered in webs). Any creature caught in or moving through the webs is attacked by a spider swarm (or multiple swarms, if it passes through the space of more than one swarm). The spiders don't leave the area of webbing. Destroying the web in an area destroys the swarm there as well, and completely destroying the web destroys all the swarms.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (5th):</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, the webs increase to a 50-foot-radius spread. Webs span any gaps between available anchor points in the area, possibly creating multiple non-contiguous webbed areas. Non-mythic abilities that make creatures immune to webs (such as freedom of movement) instead give them a +5 bonus on saves, combat maneuver checks, and Escape Artist checks against mythic web.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Whirlwind</h2>\n<p>The cyclone becomes 15 feet wide at the base, 40 feet wide at the top, and 40 feet tall. The cyclone's effect on Large or smaller creatures also applies to Huge creatures, and its damage increases to 3d8 points of damage. The effect on Medium or smaller creatures also applies to Large creatures, and the damage it deals each turn increases to 2d6 points of damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented (8th):</strong> If you expend three uses of mythic power, the cyclone's size increases to 50 feet wide at the base, 150 feet wide at the top, and 150 feet tall. Creatures and objects of all sizes touched by the whirlwind take 8d8 points of damage (Reflex negates), and the damage dealt to those trapped in the cyclone increases to 6d6 points of damage per round. Additionally, unattended objects smaller than 30 feet to a side are swept up in the effect. The area within 20 feet of the whirlwind is treated as severe wind (Core Rulebook 439), and within 40 feet it is treated as strong wind.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Wish</h2>\n<p>When using mythic wish to duplicate another spell, you can duplicate a mythic spell you know (if you're a spontaneous caster) or have prepared (if you're a caster who prepares spells). If you don't know or haven't prepared the mythic spell, you can expend a second use of mythic power to duplicate the mythic version of the desired spell.</p>\n<p>You can also produce any one of the following effects that modify or replace effects listed in the non-mythic wish spell description:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you use mythic wish to remove injuries and afflictions, you can expend a number of uses of mythic power to remove that number of additional afflictions from all affected creatures.</li>\n<li>If you use mythic wish to revive the dead, you can expend a second use of mythic power to negate the target's permanent negative level from the resurrection.</li>\n<li>Alter fate. By expending a second use of mythic power, you can cast mythic wish as an immediate action before a 1d20 roll is attempted and choose what number you want to come up on the die.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Augmented:</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can cast a silent, stilled mythic wish, even if you're helpless or couldn't otherwise take actions (but not unconscious).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Word Of Chaos</h2>\n<p>When determining the spell's effect on non-mythic creatures, add your tier to your caster level. Non-chaotic creatures that fail their saves against the spell also take a -4 penalty on attack rolls and saving throws, and their spell resistance decreases by 5 for as long as the spell's other effects last.</p>"}

Elements OF A Mythic Adventure","permission":{"default":0,"xdjh9CzHvgUgsBmZ":3},"folder":"","flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_6pywj25kmcf","path":"Pathfinder Mythic Adventures Reference Library#/CP_SEP/Chapter 4 Running A Mythic Game#/CP_SEP/Mythic Story Structure","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<p>Beyond the story, there are a wide variety of elements you can add to give your campaign a mythic feel. These elements are different ways of looking at various parts of an adventure. A mythic adventure should contain some of these, though not necessarily all at once.</p>\n<p><strong>Cunning Foes:</strong> The enemies mythic characters face should be cunning and devious in their plans. Unlike normal monsters that tend to wait around to be fought, a cunning foe is proactive in its efforts to defeat the PCs. Such enemies use the environment to their benefit, utilize their abilities to the fullest, and have at least one contingency plan. Cunning foes frequently escape a losing battle to regroup and prepare another attack. After the PCs' first encounter with a cunning enemy, their foe learns from that experience and uses new tricks and tactics to neutralize the PCs' strengths. The foe might even do research or conduct reconnaissance before the fight, pitting the PCs against her minions while she watches silently, noting the PCs' capabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Hard Consequences:</strong> With all the incredible power at characters' fingertips, it's easy to forget that the heroes are still people - complicated and flawed. Mythic heroes suffer or witness dramatic consequences in stories all the time, and it's those moments that define a hero and help us connect with her. There are different ways to bring about consequences. Failure is one option, whether it is failing a combat or skill check or to failing to make the right decision (see The Importance of Failure on page 120). There are other ways to bring about consequences, though, such as having something unforeseen happen because of the PCs' actions. Imagine watching the countryside burn because you used a mythic fireball to defeat a foe. And there is always the classic story moment of presenting a hard choice, where no option is without cost. It's through suffering and reacting to such consequences that the true nature of these mythic heroes emerges.</p>\n<p><strong>Impressive Settings:</strong> The world of mythic adventures is enormous and dramatic. While a large keep is certainly impressive, one with a 200-foot-tall tower at its heart is more suitably awe-inspiring. This applies to natural environments as well, such as an entire forest with plants five times the normal size, waterfalls more than 100 feet high, or an immense volcano erupting at its heart. This might also take the form of a location with supernatural effects, such as a lake that is perfectly calm even when disturbed, or a swamp that is preternaturally dark. These places should appeal to all the senses, making them vibrant and memorable.</p>\n<p><strong>Legendary Creatures:</strong> Some creatures the PCs face should be legends in their own rights. While those that are drawn from ancient myth (such as the minotaur and the medusa), are likely candidates, any monster can fit into this category given the proper backstory. A random encounter with a dire wolf in the wilderness isn't especially legendary, but if the PCs visit the nearby town first and learn that there's a feral monster that's been feeding on townsfolk for a decade, and there are many local myths about the beast, that same encounter gains a legendary quality. Defeating such foes adds to the mythic characters' story, making these moments important to a mythic adventure.</p>\n<p><strong>Otherworldly Influence:</strong> Whether from artifacts, ancient magic, or the gods, mythic power is beyond that of the mortal realm. When the PCs gain such power, they attract the attention of mysterious forces that seek to control or otherwise influence them. This can take many forms, from a deity speaking to them through a cryptic seer, a strange sign from the stars, or gifts left in a tranquil glade to aid the heroes on their journey. Not all such influences will be beneficial - the PCs might be hammered by powerful storms, led astray by a constantly changing map, or attacked by agents of an evil power. The PCs should feel like their quest has caught the attention of powerful forces, even if they do not understand their sources or motives.</p>\n<p><strong>Powerful Enemies:</strong> Foes should have powers and abilities far beyond those the PCs normally expect to face. Through their mythic abilities, the PCs have the tools to defeat these challenges, but such foes are powerful and dangerous nonetheless - more than capable of bringing pain to the world if not defeated. Battles with powerful foes make it clear that the PCs truly need their mythic power to survive. Of course, not every fight should be against a powerful foe; lesser foes give the PCs a chance to show off their talents.</p>\n<p><strong>Supernatural Events:</strong> Strange and wonderful events surround mythic characters, events that twist and alter the world around them. Such events might be local (a perpetual blizzard in a small valley) or they might cover a vast area (a gloom that covers the sun). These supernatural events are in some way tied to the story of the characters. Perhaps the blizzard is the sign of a mystical frozen water elemental seer who is trying to get the heroes' attention. Or the gloom covering the sun is caused by a mythic demon seeking to bring ruin to the surface world.</p>"}

The hermetic flask and its creations function for only users with the alchemy class feature (Pathfinder Rpg Advanced Player's Guide 26) and the ability to make extracts. Using the flask normally requires an alchemist's lab or crafting kit. Makeshift tools can be used, but result in a -5 penalty on all checks.</p>\n<p>If a user spends 10 minutes and 100 gp, and succeeds at a DC 30 Craft (alchemy) check, the flask can distill one dose of alchemical essence. If the user expends one use of mythic power during the distilling process, 10 doses are made instead. Alchemical essence remains stable only as long as it's contained within the hermetic flask. As a standard action, an alchemist can pour forth a dose and immediately convert it into an alchemical item worth 100 gp or less, or into a poison worth 1,000 gp or less. He may throw it or apply it as part of the same standard action.</p>\n<p>A weapon-like liquid, such as alchemist's fire, congeals into a fragile globule and remains stable until thrown or otherwise broken. Any such substance poured from the flask remains stable for 1 minute, and then dissolves harmlessly. The purity of the alchemical essence increases the effectiveness of alchemical items derived from it. Any save DCs associated with the item increase by 2, and any damage caused or healed by it increases by 50% (including ability damage). The hermetic flask can hold a maximum of 10 doses of alchemical essence at a time.</p>\n<p>The user can identify the properties of an unknown alchemical substance or poison by pouring it into an empty hermetic flask and succeeding at a DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check for a normal substance, or a DC 30 or 35 check for a rarer substance. This analysis takes 1 minute and doesn't destroy the substance. Poisons analyzed in the flask can be converted into an antidote as part of this check, consuming the poison in the process. Such an antidote automatically cures the poison in any creature currently suffering from it, and provides immunity to further exposure to that specific poison for 24 hours. The antidote remains stable for as long as it's within the flask, and for 1 minute after it's removed.</p>\n<p>By expending one use of mythic power and using the flask as part of a Craft check, the user can halve the cost of materials needed to create an alchemical item or poison. This doesn't apply to the creation of alchemical essence.</p>\n<h1>Destruction</h1>\n<p>A hermetic flask can be destroyed by using it to analyze any of the products of a philosopher's stone. Such an act of hubris shatters the flask in a powerful explosion, dealing 25d6 points of fire damage in a 30-foot-radius spread. The person performing the experiment receives no saving throw. Other victims can halve the damage with a successful DC 30 Reflex save.</p>"}

Once it infects a host, Plaguebringer renders him immune to the effects of any lesser disease. Despite this immunity, the host can still spread disease; indeed, his body becomes an incubator for the countless ailments of the mortal world. When exposed to a disease, the host automatically fails any saving throw to avoid contracting it, but suffers no ill effects. The host indefinitely remains an asymptomatic carrier for any diseases caught.</p>\n<p>Plaguebringer also grants the following abilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The host receives a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, caster level checks, and saving throws.</li>\n<li>The host generates an aura of unlife in a 30-foot radius. All living creatures other than the host within this radius take 2d6 points of negative energy damage each round. Undead creatures gain fast healing 5 that stacks with any fast healing they already possess. This aura can be suppressed or resumed as a standard action.</li>\n<li>As part of using an ability that requires him to expend mythic power, the host can target a mythic creature within 30 feet. If that creature fails a DC 23 Fortitude save, it contracts a random disease (as contagion) and one use of its mythic power is stolen and granted to the host. If the host fails to steal mythic power, he must expend double the usual amount of his own mythic power or the ability fails.</li>\n<li>The host can use contagion heightened to 8th level (DC 23) at will.</li>\n<li>The host can use empowered vampiric touch three times per day.</li>\n<li>As a swift action, the host can expend one use of mythic power to gain the effects of death ward, divine power, and spell resistance. These effects last 1 round per tier he possesses and can't be dispelled.</li>\n<li>Once per day, the host can expend two uses of mythic power to summon a nightwingB2 to do his bidding for 1 hour. If the nightwing is slain, a new one can't be summoned for 1 week.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Plaguebringer is intelligent, with an Intelligence score of 15,</p>\n<p>a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 20. It has a neutral evil alignment, communicates by empathy, and has an Ego of 30. It exists only to spread disease and cause suffering. It protects and aids hosts that please it. If infecting a host who resists these goals, it withholds its abilities and attempts to control the host. Plaguebringer can take a single standard or swift action on its host's turn to activate any of its powers that don't require a touch attack. It has five uses of mythic power available to expend each day. It can use its host's own mythic power by becoming dominant (Pathfinder Rpg Core Rulebook 535).</p>\n<p>When infecting a host, it has full access to its host's senses, along with darkvision and blindsense with a range of 120 feet. When not in a host, Plaguebringer has only limited awareness, with hearing and blindsense usable to a range of 30 feet and no vision. When not infecting a host, Plaguebringer is undetectable by normal vision due to its microscopic size, though detect evil reveals its presence. It can fly at a speed of 30 feet, and can infect a new host by entering its body. If the target fails a DC 30 Fortitude save, Plaguebringer infects it and the creature gains access to the artifact's powers. If the target succeeds, Plaguebringer can't attempt to infect it again for 1 month.</p>\n<p>Plaguebringer can leave a host by becoming dominant and choosing to leave. Immediately after it leaves, the host is affected by multiple contagion effects (DC 30), one for each of the diseases listed in the spell.</p>\n<h1>Destruction</h1>\n<p>To be destroyed, Plaguebringer must first be forced or tricked into the body of an angel. The angel must then willingly sacrifice itself by dying at the heart of a star.</p>"}

Use Table 6-8: Monster Statistics by CR (see page 229) to evaluate whether the monster's abilities are appropriately challenging for its final CR. If a creature's mythic abilities complement its non-mythic abilities particularly well, that mythic creature may be too powerful for its final CR. If a creature's mythic abilities don't interact with its non-mythic abilities, that creature may be too weak for its final CR. If either of these situations occur, make adjustments to the creature so it better fits the intended CR.</p>\n<p>If the creature is too weak and you rounded the creature's MR down in Step 1, you can round up instead (adjusting the modifiers from the mythic subtype).

This category is listed after the feat name. The following types of feats can be found in this chapter.</p>\n<h1>Mythic Feats</h1>\n<p>Only characters with mythic tiers or creatures with mythic ranks can take these feats. If a creature becomes non-mythic, it no longer gains the benefit of these feats, but it doesn't lose them permanently. If the creature becomes mythic again, it regains the use of all the mythic feats it once had.</p>\n<p>Many mythic feats enhance non-mythic feats with the same name. When a creature has a mythic version of a feat, that feat is denoted with a superscript \"M\" in the feat line of its stat block. Other superscript combinations refer to the books cited on page 7.</p>\n<h1>Metamagic Feats</h1>\n<p>Metamagic feats allow spellcasters to modify and change their spells, granting the spells new powers and effects. Such spells generally take up a higher-level spell slot than the normal spell. For the complete rules on how to apply metamagic feats to spells, see page 112 of the Core Rulebook.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Mythic And Metamagic Feats</h1>\n<p>You'll notice there are no mythic metamagic feats. Because mythic versions of spells are, in a way, metamagic of their own, and there are many mythic abilities that empower such spellcasting, there is no need for mythic metamagic feats. If you desire more potent spellcasting power, select the Mythic Spell Lore feat multiple times.</p>\n<p>There is also a non-mythic metamagic feat for casting spells as their mythic versions: @Compendium[pf-content.feats.VZMdXYdGMcD7joB9]{Ascendant Spell}.</p>"}
{"_id":"HzIplhyvxigMdT9z","name":"6.1.2. Mythic Rank","permission":{"default":0,"xdjh9CzHvgUgsBmZ":3},"folder":"","flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_2l6zltoe3o3","path":"Pathfinder Mythic Adventures Reference Library#/CP_SEP/Chapter 6 Mythic MonsterS#/CP_SEP/Chapter 6 Mythic MonsterS","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<p>A monster's mythic rank (MR) is a game statistic for monsters that's roughly equivalent to a mythic tier - monsters with only a little mythic power are 1st rank, and the greatest mythic monsters are 10th rank. Unlike PCs, monsters usually start with a specific mythic rank and that rank never changes. For example, a mythic troll is 2nd rank and is always going to be 2nd rank, unless the GM has a reason for its rank to increase - like if a tribe of trolls has an artifact that grants the trolls mythic power, and the longer it takes the PCs to deal with them, the more powerful the artifact makes these monsters.</p>\n<p>In terms of power, mythic ranks and mythic tiers are similar, but not exactly the same. For any ability, spell, magic item, or other rule that requires a mythic tier or interfaces with the tier rules, a monster's mythic rank counts as its tier. For example, a sword that gains additional abilities when wielded by a character of 3rd tier or higher gains those bonuses when wielded by a monster of 3rd rank or higher. A few mythic monsters have mythic tier abilities identical to those available to PCs; a monster's mythic rank counts as its tier for any effects dependent on tier. For example, a monster with the parry spell guardian path ability (see page 30) uses its mythic rank to determine the level of spells it can parry with that ability.</p>\n<p>It is possible for a low-CR creature to have a high mythic rank, or for a high-CR creature to have a low mythic rank. For a typical monster that's acquired mythic power, its rank is equal to half its original CR. For example, a CR 4 owlbear that becomes a mythic creature should be 2nd rank. To determine a mythic monster's final CR, add half its mythic rank to its original CR. For example, a 2nd rank mythic owlbear's final CR is 5 (2 &times; 1/2 + 4). See Designing Encounters in Chapter 4 for more details (see page 128). All the monsters presented in this chapter use this typical MR value.</p>\n<p>A creature shouldn't have both a mythic tier and a mythic rank. For example, a mythic creature that gains the vampire template (Bestiary 270) has a mythic tier, and a non-mythic creature that gains the mythic vampire template (see page 220) has a mythic rank, but a mythic creature that becomes a mythic vampire loses its tier and gains ranks instead, as explained in the mythic vampire template. Mythic templates and other effects that grant a creature a mythic rank should include information about what happens when a mythic creature gains that template or effect.</p>"}

This gives them a chance to experience life as mundane heroes, struggling to earn enough gold to keep themselves fed and allowing them to explore the normal world around them.</p>\n<p>When the PCs first come in contact with something truly wondrous, the mythic campaign starts in earnest. They learn that there's much more to the world around them than they first realized. This can take the form of some great, emerging danger that the PCs cannot hope to defeat as they currently are. Perhaps an incredibly powerful dragon threatens the land, a long-dead god returns to the world, or the fearsome tarrasque reawakens. The PCs are drawn into this story as their lives are forever changed by this unchallengeable threat. These low-level characters should not combat such a beast, but they might be in a town ravaged by the threat, leaving them with no choice but to flee along with everyone else or perish. After that event, they're linked to the threat, but right now have no means of dealing with it.</p>"}

You can select this ability twice.</p>\n<p><strong>Assured Drinker (Ex):</strong> No one can stop you from imbibing, even in combat. You don't provoke attacks of opportunity when drinking an elixir, extract, or potion. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to retrieve and drink an elixir, extract, or potion.</p>\n<p><strong>Assured Skill (Ex):</strong> In times of need, you're virtually assured success when using skills. As a free action before you roll a skill check, you can expend one use of mythic power to roll that skill check twice, take the higher result, and add your tier to the total.</p>\n<p><strong>Astounding Disable (Ex):</strong> Whenever you use Disable Device to disarm a trap or open a lock, doing so is only a move action and doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p><strong>Clown (Su):</strong> As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to make one creature laugh uncontrollably, as the hideous laughter spell. The saving throw against this effect is equal to 10 + your tier + your Charisma modifier. If you aren't in combat when you use this ability, it can affect any number of creatures in a burst with a radius of 10 feet per tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Combat Trickery (Ex):</strong> Through buffoonery and deceit, you can trick opponents into moving where you want them. You can make a single combat maneuver check using your Bluff check modifier in place of your Cmb. Apply the result of this check to all adjacent opponents, and resolve it for each enemy independently as a bull rush, drag, or reposition combat maneuver. For example, if facing three opponents, you can roll one check and attempt to bull rush the first, drag the second, and reposition the third.</p>\n<p><strong>Control the Mindless (Su):</strong> You can gain control over mindless constructs and undead. Using this ability is a standard action, and requires you to make a Knowledge check against the target's Cmd. Use a Knowledge (arcana) check against a mindless construct, or a Knowledge (religion) check against a mindless undead. If your check equals or exceeds the creature's Cmd, you can give the creature an order that lasts up to 1 round. For every 5 by which you beat the DC, your control lasts 1 additional round. The creature's creator or controller can't regain control during this time unless it also uses this ability. If you expend one use of mythic power when attempting to use this ability, the duration of your control increases from rounds to an equal number of minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Crime Spree (Su):</strong> As a standard action when not in combat, you can attempt two Sleight of Hand checks to take items from other creatures, but you take a -5 penalty on each check. As a standard action in combat, you can expend one use of mythic power to attempt a steal combat maneuver check against each creature within your reach that you choose, without provoking attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p><strong>Deadly Dodge (Ex):</strong> As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to gain a +4 dodge bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn. During this time, whenever a creature misses on a melee attack against you, it provokes an attack of opportunity from you. You can choose to either take this attack of opportunity or force that creature to reroll the attack and change the target to a creature of your choice that is adjacent to you and within the attacker's reach. This reroll uses the same modifiers as the initial attack roll.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Move (Ex):</strong> Once per round, you can designate one opponent. Unless you attempt to move through that opponent's space, your movement (including standing up from a prone position) doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity from that opponent. If you move through the opponent's space, you can still attempt an Acrobatics check to do so without provoking an attack of opportunity. You can take this ability more than once. Each additional time you select it, you can designate one additional opponent when you move.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhance Magic Items (Ex):</strong> Your mythic presence enhances the power of certain magic items. Add half your tier to the caster level of potions, scrolls, staves, and wands you use. When using a staff or wand, you may activate the item by expending one use of mythic power instead of one of the item's charges.</p>\n<p><strong>Ghostly Performance (Su):</strong> Whenever you use bardic performance, you don't need to spend an action to maintain the effect. This means you can maintain the performance if paralyzed or stunned, although it still ends if you are unconscious or dead. You must still expend rounds of bardic performance to continue the effect. Once you start a performance, its effect continues whether or not the subjects can perceive you or the performance. When the performance ends, its effects linger for a number of rounds equal to your tier. This extended duration stacks with any other abilities that extend the duration of your performance, such as Lingering Performance. This ability doesn't change how many active performances you can have at once.</p>\n<p><strong>Impeccable Balance (Ex):</strong> Even the smallest of handholds and outcroppings are more than sufficient for your purposes. You automatically succeed at all Acrobatics checks to walk along narrow ledges. Your Acrobatics checks never take a penalty because of obstructed, slippery, sloped, or unsteady surfaces, and you can move at full speed across such surfaces with no penalty. You also gain a +10 bonus to Cmd against trip attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Improbable Prestidigitation (Su):</strong> You can attempt a Sleight of Hand check to hide or retrieve objects in a personal extradimensional space, similar to a glove of storing. You can take 10 or 20 on this check, and the space can hold up to 1 cubic foot of material per tier. An item the size of a potion or dagger can be stored or retrieved with a successful DC 20 Sleight of Hand check; the DC increases to 25 for an item roughly the size of a one-handed weapon. Storing an item is a swift action, and retrieving it is a move action. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to retrieve any number of items from your extradimensional space.</p>\n<p><strong>Inspire Minions (Ex):</strong> When you use a spell, a bardic performance, or another class feature to grant a morale or competence bonus, the bonus increases by 2 for creatures with at least 4 Hit Dice fewer than you. For example, if you're a 6th-level bard using inspire courage, creatures with 2 Hit Dice or fewer receive a +4 morale bonus on fear saves and a +4 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls instead of +2.</p>\n<p><strong>Master Dilettante (Ex):</strong> You are passingly familiar with almost every subject and have dabbled in numerous fields and activities. You gain a competence bonus equal to your tier on all untrained skill checks. You can attempt all skill checks untrained, even if the skill normally cannot be used untrained.</p>\n<p><strong>Master of Escape (Su):</strong> You can use the Escape Artist skill to break free from spells and magical effects that limit your movement or actions. While you're subject to a spell or effect that gives you the entangled, grappled, paralyzed, pinned, staggered, or stunned condition, once per round as a free action, you can attempt an Escape Artist check to end the condition. The DC for this check is equal to the save DC of the spell or effect that caused the condition. If you succeed, you end one such condition on yourself (your choice), though this doesn't make you immune to similar effects from the same source (such as moving through black tentacles or web). If the spell or effect doesn't allow a saving throw, you can't use this ability to overcome it.</p>\n<p><strong>Nimble Glide (Ex):</strong> Whenever you fall, you don't take any damage and you land on your feet. When using this ability, you fall at a rate of 150 feet per round, and can move up to 5 feet horizontally for every 10 feet you fall.</p>\n<p><strong>No One of Consequence (Ex):</strong> Your mythic nature is a cloak that can shield you from the minds and memories of others. Creatures struggle to recognize you, recall your appearance, remember the nature of conversations they had with you, and recount the actions you took when you were in their presence. If a creature makes a deliberate attempt to recall details about time spent with you, it must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + your tier + your Charisma modifier) to recall anything beyond vague details. In addition, you're under a permanent nondetection effect with a caster level equal to your character level plus your tier. You can end this effect at any time, and can resume it as a swift action.</p>\n<p><strong>Path Dabbling (Su):</strong> Select one path ability from another mythic path. You must meet any other requirements that path ability has, including a minimum tier restriction.</p>\n<p><strong>Persuasive Countenance (Su):</strong> Whenever you encounter a creature whose attitude is at least indifferent to you, treat its attitude as one step better. If the creature's starting attitude is helpful, you can make requests of the creature with a +5 bonus on your Diplomacy or Intimidate check.</p>\n<p><strong>Ranged Disable (Ex):</strong> As a standard action, you can use a thrown weapon or reach weapon to attempt a Disable Device check to disable a device. If you're using a thrown weapon, the range of this ability is 30 feet; otherwise, it's your reach with the reach weapon. You take a -5 penalty on the check and can't take 10 on the check, even if you have an ability that would normally allow you to do so. If you expend one use of mythic power, you ignore the -5 penalty and can attempt the check in place of an attack (such as if making a full attack or attack of opportunity).</p>\n<p><strong>Ricochet (Ex):</strong> Whenever a creature has cover from your ranged attack, you can deflect the shot off a nearby surface, treating that surface as the origin point of the attack to determine whether the target receives a cover bonus to its AC. You can use this ability to attack a creature with total concealment from you if you know what square it occupies, but the attack still has a 50% miss chance.</p>\n<p><strong>Shadow Stealth (Ex):</strong> Whenever you're in darkness, you can move at full speed within that area without taking a penalty on Stealth checks. As a move action, you can expend one use of mythic power to teleport from one area of darkness to another within 100 feet as if using greater teleport. You must have line of effect to the destination.</p>\n<p><strong>Subtle Magic (Ex):</strong> Whenever you cast a spell or activate a spell trigger or spell completion magic item, you can attempt a Bluff skill check opposed by a Sense Motive check from anyone that can see you. Those who fail the opposed check don't know that you cast a spell or activated an item unless it has an obvious effect that emanates from you. In addition, the magical auras of magical effects on you and magic items you carry (except for artifacts) can't be detected.</p>\n<p><strong>Supreme Stealth (Ex):</strong> Choose one of the following senses: blindsight, scent, or tremorsense. A creature using the chosen sense can't automatically detect you, and must succeed at Perception checks as normal to do so. If you choose blindsight, this ability also affects blindsense. You can select this ability up to three times, each time choosing a different sense.</p>\n<p><strong>This Might Just Work (Ex):</strong> You're adept at combining optimistic resourcefulness with natural skill. You can attempt a skill check with a class skill in place of a skill that uses the same ability score modifier. For example, you could attempt an Acrobatics check in place of a Stealth check because both skills are based on Dexterity. You take a -5 penalty on this check and can't take 10 or 20 on it. The GM can disallow certain uses of this ability when the skill can't possibly be applied to the task.</p>\n<p><strong>Thwart Detection (Su):</strong> You can bypass magical constructs, spells, and traps that are meant to allow only certain creatures to move or act within their range. This includes constructs, spells, and traps that can be bypassed with a password as well as those that can be programmed to exclude specific creatures based on type or other physical characteristics (such as alarm, forbiddance, glyph of warding, and symbol of death). You must be aware of the construct, spell, or trap's existence, though not necessarily its specific parameters, for this ability to function. For instance, you can't bypass a trap you haven't noticed. You can fool a mindless construct if it was programmed to allow certain creatures to enter its area without provoking a response, but not if it was ordered to prevent anyone from entering with no exceptions. If you expend one use of mythic power for each effect, you can bring with you a number of allies equal to your tier. They must remain within 10 feet of you until out of range of the bypassed effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Titan's Bane (Ex):</strong> You can move through the space of any creature two or more size categories larger than you without provoking attacks of opportunity, and you can share such a creature's space. When sharing a larger opponent's space, you gain cover against all melee and ranged attacks it makes, and it is considered flat-footed for the purposes of any melee or ranged attacks you make against it.</p>\n<p><strong>Transfer Magic (Su):</strong> Your mythic nature allows you to take magic from others as easily as you could take their gold. By expending one use of mythic power as a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack to transfer an active magical effect from a target creature to you. If you succeed, the highest-level effect on the target transfers to you (determine randomly if the target has multiple effects with the same level), ending the effect for the target and continuing it on you with the remaining duration as if you were the original target. You may end the effect on yourself as a standard action; this doesn't cause it to revert to the original target. If the transferred magic can't affect you (for example, if it doesn't affect creatures of your type), it ends immediately as if dispelled. You can't use this ability to transfer continuous bonuses from magic items, such as an armor bonus from bracers of armor.</p>\n<p><strong>Trap Taker (Ex):</strong> You can use the Use Magic Device skill instead of Disable Device to disable magical traps. If your Use Magic Device check overcomes the DC to disable the trap by 5 or more, you can instead leave the trap in place, but change it so that you and your allies can bypass it. You can also alter the trap so the original creator and any creatures he might have designated as safe instead set off the trap. If you expend one use of mythic power when altering a trap in this way, you can move the trap to any point within 100 feet that is in line of sight.</p>\n<p><strong>Treacherous Critical (Ex):</strong> When you score a critical threat, you can attempt a free combat maneuver check instead of dealing extra damage. If you do, attempt your confirmation roll as normal and add your tier to the result. If the result is equal to or greater than your opponent's Cmd, the attack deals damage as normal and you can attempt a free dirty trick, disarm, reposition, or trip combat maneuver check against that opponent, using the confirmation roll as your combat maneuver check for the purpose of determining the effects of the maneuver.</p>\n<p><strong>Unwavering Skill (Ex):</strong> You can always take 10 or 20 on class skills, even if threatened or in a hazardous situation. You can't use this ability with skill checks that don't normally allow you to take 10 or take 20.</p>\n<p><strong>Wall Run (Ex):</strong> When you move, you can travel across vertical surfaces as if they were floors. If your movement doesn't end on a horizontal surface, you fall at the end of your move unless you are able to remain in place using another ability (such as using the Climb skill to cling to a handhold). The vertical surface must be capable of supporting your weight - for example, you couldn't move across a windowpane or curtain.</p>\n<p>Special Abilities</p>"}

This ability allows it to move any fire effect in the area, as if it were the caster. This ability also allows it to reposition a stationary fire effect, although the new placement must be one allowed by the spell.

They are the embodiments of destruction, hatred, and draconic arrogance. Magnificent and utterly frightening to behold, mythic red dragons possess a fierce beauty that exceeds all other dragons. From their powerful jaws, capable of snapping iron bars and the masts of ships, to their muscular tails, which can crash through stone walls as easily as whips break skin, red dragons reflect predatory superiority and murderous perfection. A mythic red dragon's body has cordlike muscles that allow it to move more quickly and gracefully than a creature of its size should have a right to.</p><p>Villains of the worst kind, mythic red dragons are unflinchingly evil in ways rarely matched even by other mythic evil creatures. Their destructive impulses and wrathful fiery rampages surprise and delight the most heinous demons. These legendary dragons demand annual royal sacrifices or tribute in slaves, and think nothing of working their underlings to death.</p><p>An older mythic red dragon spends little time out of its lair, and when it does emerge it prefers to attack  humanoid settlements away from the immediate vicinity, burning down buildings, dropping peasants from great heights, and demanding coins and other treasures. This raiding pattern makes it difficult for would-be dragonslayers to find the creature's actual lair.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Mythic red dragons use their magic to protect their lairs with a variety of protective spells. A typical lair also contains slave-built mundane traps, environmental hazards such as steam vents poisonous fumes, and (if within an active volcano) molten rock as part of its defenses.</p></text>\n            "}

This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to your tier. During this duration, you can expend one use of mythic power to convert an ally's successful attack into a critical threat. The ally must be within 30 feet, and can also gain the bonus to its confirmation roll. Only one opponent can be the focus of your directed assault at a time. If you confirm a critical hit against another creature, you may make it the new focus (immediately ending the previous focus) or maintain the current focus.</p>\n<p><strong>Distracting Assailant (Ex):</strong> You make a barrage of attacks and quick feints that are so distracting your opponent loses focus against all other assailants. Whenever you successfully strike a foe with a melee weapon or natural attack, you can expend one use of mythic power as a swift action. For 1 round, that opponent loses its Dexterity bonus to AC on all attacks against it other than yours. While this ability is in effect, any allies who flank that foe gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls against it, instead of the normal +2. While the opponent is affected by this ability, each time you hit it, the duration increases by 1 round. This effect automatically ends if your turn ends and the target is not within your melee reach.</p>\n<p><strong>Focus (Su):</strong> Your mighty and inspiring presence enhances the power of your companions' heroic surges. Whenever a mythic ally that is within 30 feet uses the surge ability, it rolls its bonus die twice and takes the higher result.</p>\n<p><strong>Granted Stride (Ex):</strong> Your mythic grace means that you and your allies easily pass through undergrowth at full speed. Allies within 30 feet of you gain the benefits of woodland stride (as the ranger class feature), as long as they can see and hear you. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to allow allies within 30 feet to ignore naturally occurring difficult terrain in any of your favored terrains for 1 minute per tier. You must have the woodland stride and favored terrain class features to select this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Greater Surge (Su):</strong> Your surge is more powerful than most. Treat your tier as if it were 3 higher for the purpose of determining your mythic surge die (maximum 10th tier). When you gain your 10th tier, your surge die becomes 2d8.</p>\n<p>You are quick with stern yet helpful words of advice. Whenever an ally within line of sight fails a skill check with a skill you're trained in, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to allow that ally to reroll that skill check with a bonus equal to your tier. If the new roll is successful, your ally succeeds at that check instead of failing it. The ally who failed the skill check must be able to see and hear you to gain this reroll. You can use this ability with a skill you aren't trained in, but you must expend two uses of mythic power to do so, and the ally doesn't gain your tier as a bonus on the reroll.</p>\n<p><strong>Heroic Block (Ex):</strong> With surprising speed, you can leap to an ally's defense. When a opponent makes a melee attack against one of your allies, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to move up to double your speed or take a 5-foot step. You must end this movement adjacent to the attacking opponent. When you end this movement, you can immediately use the aid another action to grant a bonus to your ally's AC (Core Rulebook 197). This bonus is applied before the opponent's triggering attack. These actions don't count against your actions this turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Inspire Minions (Ex):</strong> When you use a spell, a bardic performance, or another class feature to grant a morale or competence bonus, the bonus increases by 2 for creatures with at least 4 Hit Dice fewer than you. For example, if you're a 6th-level bard using inspire courage, creatures with 2 Hit Dice or fewer receive a +4 morale bonus on fear saves and a +4 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls instead of +2.</p>\n<p><strong>Inspired Defense (Ex):</strong> Whenever you use bardic performance to inspire courage, the competence bonus against charm and fear effects instead applies to all saving throws. If you expend one use of mythic power when you start a bardic performance to inspire courage, you add your tier to this bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Inspiring Surge (Ex):</strong> Your surge inspires non-mythic allies to greater acts of martial daring. Each time you use your surge ability, each non-mythic ally within 30 feet gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls for the next weapon attack it makes before the start of your next turn. An ally must be able to see and hear you to gain the bonus. You can take this ability up to three times. When you take it the second time, the bonus on attack and damage rolls increases to a number equal to half your tier. When you take it a third time, the bonus on attack and damage rolls increases to a number equal to your tier instead of half your tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Lend Power (Su):</strong> You are an invaluable asset to your comrades. As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power or your confidence ability (see page 42) to grant the benefit of your surge ability to a mythic ally within 30 feet. The ally uses your surge die.</p>\n<p><strong>Lightning Performance (Ex):</strong> Your tongue is as quick as any blade. You can start a bardic performance as a swift action instead of a standard action. If you expend one use of mythic power, you can instead start a bardic performance as a free action.</p>\n<p><strong>Loyalty (Ex):</strong> You gain Leadership as a bonus feat. If you already have the Leadership feat (or if you take it at a later level), add your tier to your Leadership score. Whenever you use your marshal's order ability and your cohort is within 100 feet, you can include your cohort as an additional ally affected by your order.</p>\n<p><strong>Menacing Presence (Su):</strong> Something about you puts others on edge. You can attempt an Intimidate check to influence a creature's attitude as full-round action instead of it taking 1 minute. In combat, you can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize an opponent as a move action. If you expend one use of mythic power, you can attempt to use Intimidate to demoralize all enemies within 30 feet as a standard action, or as a move action if using the Dazzling Display feat (Core Rulebook 120).</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Fascination (Su):</strong> When you use the fascinate or suggestion bardic performance ability, non-mythic creatures take a penalty on their saving throws against it equal to half your tier. If you expend one use of mythic power when you activate the performance, the penalty also applies to mythic creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Painful Gambit (Ex):</strong> Facing off against you is never a safe option when your allies stand beside you. When you are hit by an attack of opportunity, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to allow all of your allies to make an attack of opportunity against the creature that attacked you if it's within their melee reach.</p>\n<p><strong>Perfect Aid (Ex):</strong> Whenever you successfully use the aid another action, your ally also adds your tier to the aid another bonus. If you use your surge ability on the aid another roll, add the result of the surge die to this bonus as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Persuasive Countenance (Su):</strong> Whenever you encounter a creature whose attitude is at least indifferent to you, treat its attitude as one step better. If the creature's starting attitude is helpful, you can make requests of the creature with a +5 bonus on your Diplomacy or Intimidate check.</p>\n<p><strong>Press the Advantage (Ex):</strong> When an ally seriously harms a foe, you seize the moment. When an ally within 30 feet confirms a critical hit against a creature you threaten, the target of the critical hit provokes an attack of opportunity from you. If you hit with your attack of opportunity, all of your allies gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls against that creature for 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Resurging Words (Su):</strong> Using the power of your mythic presence, you spur on allies even when all seems lost. Using this ability takes 10 uninterrupted minutes, during which time you give a stirring speech to all allies within 30 feet of you. If you expend one use of mythic power at the end of the speech, your allies gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your tier plus your Charisma modifier, and a bonus on saving throws against fear equal to half your tier (minimum 1). Any ally who currently has 1/4 of its full hit points or fewer gains twice as many temporary hit points from this ability. The temporary hit points and saving throw bonus last for 24 hours. Allies can benefit from this ability only once every 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Rise Up (Su):</strong> Your allies draw strength from your courage and leadership. As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to grant all of your non-mythic allies within 30 feet one use of the surge ability, using your surge die. This surge must be used within a number of rounds equal to your tier. An ally can benefit from this ability only once every 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Shout of Defiance (Su):</strong> You can channel holy energy into a righteous shout of defiance. As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power and one use of either channel energy or lay on hands to create a 100-foot spread of healing energy. All allies within this spread heal a number of hit points equal to 1d6 plus double your tier. If this brings an ally from negative hit points to 0 hit points or more, the ally can immediately stand up from prone without provoking an attack of opportunity.</p>\n<p><strong>Smiting Aura (Su):</strong> Whenever you use your smite evil ability, you can expend one use of your mythic power to create a 20-foot-radius aura centered on you that lasts for a number of rounds equal to your tier. Any evil creature that starts its turn in or moves into this area takes a number of points of damage equal to your tier. This damage comes from holy power, and is not affected by damage reduction or energy resistance. You must have the smite evil class ability to select this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Stand Tall (Su):</strong> Before you attempt a saving throw against a spell or effect that also targets one or more allies within 30 feet, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to allow your allies to use your saving throw result or their own, whichever is higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Tactical Genius (Su):</strong> You gain a bonus teamwork feat. You must meet all prerequisites for the feat. Any ally within 30 feet of you counts as having that teamwork feat for the purposes of you gaining bonuses from the feat (the ally doesn't gain the bonus unless it actually has the feat). At the start of each day, you can spend 10 minutes and expend one use of mythic power to replace this teamwork feat with any other teamwork feat you qualify for. You can select this ability up to three times. Each time, you gain an additional bonus teamwork feat. If you have selected this ability more than once, at the start of each day you can replace any number of teamwork feats this ability grants you, spending time and uses of mythic power for each feat you replace.</p>\n<p><strong>Unwavering Skill (Ex):</strong> You can always take 10 or 20 on checks using class skills, even if threatened or in a hazardous situation. You can't use this ability with skill checks that don't normally allow you to take 10 or take 20.</p>\n<p>Special Abilities</p>"}

These abilities are gained based on the character's mythic tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Score:</strong> Upon reaching the 2nd mythic tier, an ability score of your choice permanently increases by 2. At 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th tiers, another ability score of your choice permanently increases by 2; this can be an ability score you've already increased or a different ability score.</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Feat:</strong> Select one mythic feat or non-mythic feat as a bonus feat. You must qualify for this feat normally. You gain another mythic feat at 3rd tier, and again every 2 tiers thereafter.</p>\n<p><strong>Hard to Kill (Ex):</strong> Whenever you're below 0 hit points, you automatically stabilize without needing to attempt a Constitution check. If you have an ability that allows you to act while below 0 hit points, you still lose hit points for taking actions, as specified by that ability. Bleed damage still causes you to lose hit points when below 0 hit points. In addition, you don't die until your total number of negative hit points is equal to or greater than double your Constitution score.</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Power (Su):</strong> Mythic characters can draw upon a wellspring of power to accomplish amazing deeds and cheat fate. This power is used by a number of different abilities. Each day, you can expend an amount of mythic power equal to 3 plus double your mythic tier (5/day at 1st tier, 7/day at 2nd, etc.). This amount is your maximum amount of mythic power. If an ability allows you to regain uses of your mythic power, you can never have more than this amount.</p>\n<p><strong>Surge (Su):</strong> You can call upon your mythic power to overcome difficult challenges. You can expend one use of mythic power to increase any d20 roll you just made by rolling 1d6 and adding it to the result. Using this ability is an immediate action taken after the result of the original roll is revealed. This can change the outcome of the roll. The bonus die gained by using this ability increases to 1d8 at 4th tier, 1d10 at 7th tier, and 1d12 at 10th tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Amazing Initiative (Ex):</strong> At 2nd tier, you gain a bonus on initiative checks equal to your mythic tier. In addition, as a free action on your turn, you can expend one use of mythic power to take an additional standard action during that turn. This additional standard action can't be used to cast a spell. You can't gain an extra action in this way more than once per round.</p>\n<p><strong>Recuperation (Ex):</strong> At 3rd tier, you are restored to full hit points after 8 hours of rest so long as you aren't dead. In addition, by expending one use of mythic power and resting for 1 hour, you regain a number of hit points equal to half your full hit points (up to a maximum of your full hit points) and regain the use of any class features that are limited to a certain number of uses per day (such as barbarian rage, bardic performance, spells per day, and so on). This rest is treated as 8 hours of sleep for such abilities. This rest doesn't refresh uses of mythic power or any mythic abilities that are limited to a number of times per day.</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Saving Throws (Ex):</strong> At 5th tier, whenever you succeed at a saving throw against a spell or special ability, you suffer no effects as long as that ability didn't come from a mythic source (such as a creature with a mythic tier or mythic ranks). If you fail a saving throw that results from a mythic source, you take the full effects as normal.</p>\n<p><strong>Force of Will (Ex):</strong> At 6th tier, you can exert your will to force events to unfold as you would like. As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to reroll a d20 roll you just made, or force any non-mythic creature to reroll a d20 roll it just made. You can use this ability after the results are revealed. Whoever rerolls a roll must take the result of the second roll, even if it is lower.</p>\n<p><strong>Unstoppable (Ex):</strong> At 8th tier, you can expend one use of mythic power as a free action to immediately end any one of the following conditions currently affecting you: bleed, blind, confused, cowering, dazed, dazzled, deafened, entangled, exhausted, fascinated, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, panicked, paralyzed, shaken, sickened, staggered, or stunned. All other conditions and effects remain, even those resulting from the same spell or effect that caused the selected condition. You can use this ability at the start of your turn even if a condition would prevent you from acting.</p>\n<p><strong>Immortal (Su):</strong> At 9th tier, if you are killed, you return to life 24 hours later, regardless of the condition of your body or the means by which you were killed. When you return to life, you aren't treated as if you had rested, and don't regain the use of abilities that recharge with rest until you next rest. This ability doesn't apply if you're killed by a coup de grace or critical hit performed by either a mythic creature (or creature of even greater power) or a non-mythic creature wielding a weapon capable of bypassing epic damage reduction. At 10th tier, you can be killed only by a coup de grace or critical hit made with an artifact.</p>\n<p><strong>Legendary Hero (Su):</strong> At 10th tier, you have reached the height of mortal power. You regain uses of your mythic power at the rate of one use per hour, in addition to completely refreshing your uses each day.</p>"}

As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to hinder opponents until the end of your next turn. When this ability is active, any creature moving out of one of your threatened squares, even when making a 5-foot step or using a form of movement that doesn't usually provoke attacks of opportunity, provokes an attack of opportunity from you. If your attack of opportunity hits and deals damage, the creature remains in its current space and its movement ends. Alternatively, you can expend one use of mythic power as part of a charge. If the charge attack hits, the target can't move itself from its space until the beginning of your next turn (though others can move the creature).</p>\n<p><strong>Dimensional Grappler (Su):</strong> When you have an opponent grappled or pinned and it attempts to use a teleportation effect, you can attempt a Will save against the effect, even if it would not normally allow a save.

If you have the Whirlwind Attack feat, you can use this ability at the same time that you make an attack against each foe within reach, allowing you to attempt a free bull rush combat maneuver check against each foe that you hit. After you've pushed opponents backward, you may move with any one of your bull rush targets.</p>\n<p><strong>Earth Protection (Su):</strong> As long as you're in contact with earth or unworked stone, you can expend one use of mythic power as a standard action to draw energy from the earth and radiate it outward, granting yourself and allies within 30 feet DR 10/adamantine for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Impervious Body (Su):</strong> You gain DR 5/epic. This ability can be taken a second time at 6th tier or higher and a third time at 9th tier or higher. Each additional time it's taken, the DR increases by 5.</p>\n<p><strong>Impervious Companion (Su):</strong> You can make your bonded creature more resistant to damage. Select one animal companion, eidolon, familiar, or bonded mount. This creature gains any epic damage reduction that you gain from the impervious body path ability. You must have the impervious body path ability to select this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Incredible Parry (Ex):</strong> You gain the duelist's parry ability (Core Rulebook 383), and you may expend one use of mythic power to add a number equal to your tier to the parry roll. If you already have the duelist's parry ability, you can use incredible parry and the duelist's parry class ability in the same round, electing to not make two attacks and instead parrying up to two attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Parry Spell (Su):</strong> As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to block a spell targeting you or an ally adjacent to you. The spell must be a ray, a single-target spell, or a spell that creates an effect targeting one creature (such as acid arrow), and the level of the spell's spell slot must be equal to or lower than your tier. Make an attack roll as if making an attack of opportunity. If the result of the attack roll is greater than the spell's attack roll or save DC, the spell has no effect on the intended target (though other targets from the same spell, such as multiple targets of scorching ray, are affected normally). A spell that has neither a DC nor an attack roll (such as magic missile) can't be affected by this ability. You must declare using spell parry after the spellcaster's target is announced, but before the target's saving throw or attack roll is made.</p>\n<p><strong>Possess Companion (Su):</strong> You can expend one use of mythic power to project your soul from your body and into your animal companion, cohort, eidolon, familiar, or bonded mount as if possessing that creature with the magic jar spell. Unlike with magic jar, the companion creature's soul remains within its body, allowing you to know what it knows and share its memories. This effect lasts until you end it as a standard action.</p>\n<p><strong>Shrug It Off (Ex):</strong> Whenever an enemy confirms a critical hit against you or your animal companion, eidolon, familiar, or bonded mount, you can expend one use of your mythic power as an immediate action to convert the critical hit into a normal hit. Effects that trigger only on a critical hit don't trigger when you use this ability to negate the critical hit.</p>\n<p><strong>To the Death (Ex):</strong> You can shrug off wounds that others would find devastating. When below 0 hit points, you don't fall unconscious, but are instead staggered. You lose 1 hit point at the end of each turn when you take a standard action while staggered in this way.</p>\n<p><strong>Turn the Tables (Ex):</strong> If a creature fails a combat maneuver check made against you, as an immediate action you can expend one use of mythic power to attempt that same maneuver against that creature. You receive a +10 bonus on this combat maneuver check.</p>\n<p>Special Abilities</p>"}

This includes spell effects such as wall of force, but not objects that are also creatures, such as animated objects.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Fury (Su):</strong> You can cause your body to erupt with elemental power. As a move action, you can expend one use of mythic power and pick one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. For a number of rounds equal to your tier, you are immune to this energy type and all of your melee and ranged attacks deal an extra 1d6 points of damage of this energy type. On a critical hit, this extra energy damage increases to 3d6.</p>\n<p><strong>Fleet Warrior (Ex):</strong> When making a full attack, you can move up to your speed either before or after your attacks. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.</p>\n<p><strong>Incredible Parry (Ex):</strong> You gain the duelist's parry ability (Core Rulebook 383), and may expend one use of mythic power to add your tier to the parry roll. If you already have the duelist's parry ability, you can use incredible parry and duelist's parry in the same round, electing to not make two attacks and instead parrying up to two attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Maneuver Expert (Ex):</strong> You do not provoke any attacks of opportunity when you attempt a combat maneuver check. As a free action, you can expend one use of your mythic power whenever you attempt a combat maneuver check to gain the benefits of the Improved and Greater feats tied to that maneuver. You must decide to use this ability before making the roll.</p>\n<p><strong>Maximized Critical (Ex):</strong> Whenever you score a critical hit, the weapon's damage result is always the maximum possible amount you could roll. This doesn't affect other dice added to the damage, such as from sneak attack or the flaming weapon special ability. For example, if you score a critical hit with a longsword (1d8/&times;2), treat the sword's damage dice as if you had rolled 8 both times, then add any other damage bonuses that you would normally apply to a critical hit.</p>\n<p><strong>Penetrating Damage (Su):</strong> Whenever you deal damage to a creature with damage reduction, you can overcome one of the following types of damage reduction: chaotic, cold iron, evil, good, lawful, magic, or silver. You can change this type with each attack. This ability only aids in overcoming one type of damage reduction; if the creature's damage reduction requires a combination of different types of damage, you must be able to overcome the other types using other means.</p>\n<p><strong>Precision (Ex):</strong> Your deadly attacks are far more likely to hit their target than those of others. Whenever you make a full attack, your attack bonus on the additional attacks you gain by having a high base attack bonus is 5 higher. This ability can't give any of these attacks a higher attack bonus than your base attack bonus. For example, a 12th-level fighter normally has a base attack bonus of +12/+7/+2; with this ability, his base attack bonus is +12/+12/+7. This ability doesn't reduce the penalties from two-weapon fighting or other situational penalties on attack rolls (such as Combat Expertise, Power Attack, fighting defensively, or harmful conditions). You can select this ability more than once. Each time you select it, the attack bonus on additional attacks increases by another 5.</p>\n<p><strong>Titan's Rage (Su):</strong> You can cause yourself to grow in size, becoming a terrifying sight to behold. As a standard action (or a free action if you have the rage class feature), you can expend one use of mythic power to increase your size to one size category larger. This grants you a +4 size bonus to Strength and Constitution, imposes a -2 penalty to Dexterity, grants you a +2 natural armor bonus, increases your natural reach by 5 feet, and increases your weapon damage based on the new size of your weapons. This size increase lasts a number of rounds equal to your tier, and doesn't stack with any other spell or ability that alters your size.</p>\n<p><strong>To the Death (Ex):</strong> You can shrug off wounds that others would find devastating. When below 0 hit points, you don't fall unconscious, but are instead staggered. You lose 1 hit point at the end of each turn when you take a standard action while staggered in this way.</p>\n<p><strong>Unstoppable Shot (Ex):</strong> You can use a ranged or thrown weapon to make a single powerful shot that shoots through all creatures in a line. As a standard action, make a single ranged attack roll and resolve the attack against all targets in a straight line up to the maximum range of your weapon, stopping at any barrier the attack couldn't penetrate. Roll damage once and apply that damage to each creature hit by the attack. Before making the attack roll, you can expend one use of mythic power to bend the path of the attack up to two times as it strikes targets or objects. Each deflection can alter the line of the attack up to 90 degrees, allowing you to shoot around corners or cover.</p>\n<p>Special Abilities</p>"}

Whether an oversight of the creator, natural forces of the world, or unique arcane phenomena, this zone is a roiling mass of primeval matter that proves dangerous. Violent creatures of chaos drift in the mutable depths, and other powerful individuals with less noble intentions seek to control what sages term the Nascent Sphere. The heroes must learn to master and shape the primeval matter while keeping ill-meaning forces from encroaching. If the heroes lose control of the Nascent Sphere, a mythic villain may step forward to create a literal hell on the face of the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenges:</strong> The Nascent Sphere is a place of pure chaos and creation. Its mythic denizens include chaos beasts with the savage template (see page 224), howlers, and elementals. A community of proteans, led by a powerful keketar, live within the Nascent Sphere and claim it as their territory, but aren't immediately hostile to the heroes. The proteans are also not strong enough to defend the Nascent Sphere against evil attackers, including a band of vicious demodands. The arrival of a powerful azata emissary, perhaps a brijidine, complicates matters when she levies as much suspicion on the heroes as she does on the demodands.</p>\n<p><strong>Adversary:</strong> If the heroes can navigate the dangers of the Nascent Sphere, defeat the demodands, and either destroy or gain the aid of the proteans and the azata, they may finally reach the heart of the Nascent Sphere.

However, the thwarted demodands believe they can reverse the process and turn the entire area into seething chaos. Demodand assassins lurk in the shadows, ready to strike when the heroes least suspect it. Archons visit from Heaven, believing that the heroes' new home holds the key to bringing order to chaos, and may be a weapon against the legions of the Abyss. The archons are insistent in their studies and suspicious of any reluctance on the heroes' part to house their divine visitors. Peasants and mercenaries flock to the heroes' new home, looking for land and work, and if the heroes take on citizens, they may find themselves suddenly rulers of a nation and unwittingly infringing on sovereign borders.

When slipped on a finger, it sizes itself appropriately.</p>\n<p>It's said the ring has a will of its own, but if it does, it evinces no obvious agenda. It favors wearers who possess strong personality traits - either those with strong morals, who exemplify goodness and honor, or those utterly devoid of morals, with the vilest and blackest souls imaginable. The ring especially favors mythic creatures, and often refuses to slip onto the finger of a creature that lacks strong personality traits or isn't mythic.</p>\n<p>The ring has no special power over the living, but when its wearer dies or it's placed on the finger of a dead creature it deems worthy, the corpse and equipment of the wearer remain where they are but the ring vanishes entirely. Within 24 hours, a tree grows in a location that's as close as possible to where the wearer died. The next day, the tree splits along the middle, revealing a cavity where the wearer has been resurrected whole and uninjured, with the ring still adorning her finger. If the wearer died in an unsafe place, the tree appears as close to that location as possible while still being relatively safe for the wearer.</p>\n<p>This rebirth comes at a price. The wearer receives certain knowledge that somewhere in the world, another being has been resurrected along with her - an individual of an opposite alignment who is every bit as wretched as the wearer is good, or vice versa. The opposite has roughly the same level and power as the wearer. The wearer has no knowledge of this other party whatsoever, other than that it exists and is free to do whatever it wishes - perpetrate any crime or perform any good deed - thanks to the wearer. This opposite is always brought back a considerable distance from the wearer. If the wearer dies again but the opposite doesn't, the wearer is resurrected again, along with another creature of an opposed nature. This cycle continues indefinitely until the ring is discarded or it moves on.</p>\n<h1>Destruction</h1>\n<p>A ring of equilibrium is destroyed if the wearer commits suicide while wearing it and while her opposite is still alive and healthy.</p>"}

This could come from destroying a plane-shattering artifact, defeating a legendary monster, or surviving a deadly journey to a wondrous location.</p>\n<p><strong>Scope:</strong> The scope of this campaign can be quite far-ranging. The experience that grants the heroes mythic powers could occur anywhere in the campaign world (though that could be merely one of many such moments happening all around the world). Events related to the experience could send the heroes to distant lands - perhaps the heroes gain their powers from destroying an evil artifact, and learn of other such artifacts hidden in dungeons around the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Ascension:</strong> An Npc begs the heroes to destroy an artifact that's corrupting the land. After a deadly adventure, the PCs finally manage to destroy the object, but in doing so release a wave of energy that grants them mythic power.</p>\n<p>Reports of an ancient dragon ravaging an entire valley reach the heroes' ears. When they battle the beast, they find themselves vastly outmatched, but through cunning and luck, they manage to slay the dragon. Upon its death, its blood washes over them, infusing them with mythic power.</p>\n<p>While traveling overland, the heroes become lost in a wild storm. For hours, they're battered by sheets of rain, and surrounded by unnaturally thick mist that refuses to be dispersed. When the storm lifts, the heroes find themselves on the rim of an ancient, enchanted valley - one told of in many tales but few people believed to truly exist.</p>\n<p><strong>Story:</strong> Any sort of adventure could appeal to parties of legendary origin. The nature of their mythic powers could inspire certain storylines, such as recovering pieces of an artifact or hunting down the source of a pack of mythic monsters. The heroes may realize that if their experience granted them power, it could do the same for others, including those with sinister or chaotic motives. The mythic power in the heroes' bodies seems attuned to other such sources of power, and the main campaign arc involves the heroes tracking down these sources and keeping them from becoming tools of evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Since many different experiences, objects, and places in the world can be sources of mythic power, mythic villains and monsters could appear frequently. If the PCs destroyed an artifact or killed an ancient beast to gain their power, others may seek revenge for that act.</p>\n<p><strong>Ending:</strong> At the end of their journey, the heroes should come full circle, perhaps even returning to the place where they first gained their mythic power. They might have to face off against the villain that precipitated their journey, or maybe even the source of their power itself. In the end, they should feel like their legend has closure, even if they keep their mythic power.</p>"}

All allies within 30 feet gain a +2 morale bonus against fear and emotion effects, and a +4 bonus on stabilization checks. Furthermore, each time one of these allies is subject to a healing spell or effect, it heals a number of additional hit points equal to your tier. Once per day as a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power and end this aura to heal all allies within 30 feet of an amount of damage equal to 1d6 hit points per tier you possess. If dismissed, the aura automatically reactivates 24 hours later.</p>\n<p><strong>Castigate (Su):</strong> While your words can soothe and aid your friends, they are equally adept at assaulting your foes. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to unleash a scathing verbal assault that demoralizes all opponents within 30 feet for 1 minute, as if you had successfully used the Intimidate skill. These opponents must be able to clearly see and hear you, but this ability is not language dependent.</p>\n<p><strong>Fight On (Su):</strong> With an order or a determined look, you spur a wounded ally to keep fighting. As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to allow a creature other than yourself that is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points to remain conscious and alive. The creature can't die from hit point damage until after the start of your next turn. You can extend this effect for 1 round at the start of your next turn by expending another use of mythic power as a free action. Though the creature can't be killed by hit point damage, any damage it takes still applies to its current hit points. When this ability's effect ends, the creature falls unconscious or dies if its current hit points or other circumstances would otherwise cause it to do so. The creature must be within 30 feet for you to start or extend this effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Inspiring Assault (Su):</strong> As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to inspire your allies to greatness in combat. Once per turn as a free action, each of your allies can either move up to its speed or make one melee or ranged attack at its full base attack bonus. These actions don't count against its actions for the turn. Once activated, this ability lasts a number of rounds equal to your tier, but immediately ends if you don't damage an opponent with an attack or spell on your turn. This ability doesn't stack with haste or similar effects. An ally must be within 30 feet of you at the start of its turn to benefit from this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Surge of Inspiration (Su):</strong> Your very presence pushes those around you to be their very best. As an immediate action, when an ally within line of sight misses with an attack or fails a saving throw, you can expend one use of mythic power or your confidence ability to grant the ally the benefits of your surge ability on that attack roll or saving throw. The ally uses your surge die, and can apply the bonus after the result is revealed, possibly turning a failure into a success.</p>\n<p><strong>Unswerving Loyalty (Su):</strong> You are a bastion of strength and resolve, and you possess the ability to protect your mind from even the most powerful charms and compulsions. You gain immunity to non-mythic mind-affecting effects, though you can choose to be affected by them if you wish. When subject to a mind-affecting effect from a mythic source, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to gain immunity to that effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Words of Valor (Su):</strong> With a mere speech, you empower your allies to take on any foe. As a standard action, you can expend two uses of mythic power to inspire all of your allies within a 30-foot radius, granting them the effects of the spell heroism and making them immune to fear for 1 round per tier.

Regardless of its particular source, this power comes from the very fabric of magic itself, a power few dare to harness.</p>\n<p><strong>Scope:</strong> While the scope of a campaign featuring eldritch magic can be broad, since this power comes from a particular item or event, the powers should be tied to it. Perhaps the ancients created a sacred seal to be broken if certain signs presented themselves, such as a week of a blood-red moon or three comets in the sky at the same time. In this way, the mythic rules have an impact on the entire setting, but their direct influence can be limited by the source of the power.</p>\n<p><strong>Ascension:</strong> Rumors persist of books that, once read, unlock potential hidden deep within the mind and body. An ancient seer possesses these volumes and offers the heroes a chance to read one that will grant them mythic power, but only if they will defeat a creature terrorizing the city.</p>\n<p>While exploring a long-forgotten valley, the PCs encounter a strange stone monument with an ancient spell carved upon it. They discover that this is a relic from a bygone age of magic, and that it grants mythic power. Unfortunately, they aren't the only ones who've found it, and now this power has been loosed upon the world.</p>\n<p>Deep inside a forgotten dungeon, the PCs discover a room sealed by a series of complicated mundane and powerful arcane locks. Promises of great treasure led the PCs to this spot. As they break the seal on the door, a blast of arcane energy emanates from the door, knocking out the heroes and imbuing them with mythic powers. While the heroes are stunned, a creature bashes through the doors with such force that it breaks the hinges and escapes. When the PCs come to, a guardian spirit waits over them, imploring them to recapture the monstrosity they unleashed.</p>\n<p>The PCs realize that each of them inherited a curved piece of metal inscribed with symbols in an archaic script. By placing the pieces together, they form a circle. When the circle is complete, the PCs each feel energy pulse through them that causes them to ascend.</p>\n<p><strong>Story:</strong> Adventures using this theme are always tied to the source of power, either by those who wield it or those who seek to steal such power away for themselves. The PCs are drawn into this struggle and must prevent such power from falling into the wrong hands? possibly even realizing that those hands are their own.</p>\n<p>Ancient artifacts and items from distant planes carry secrets and abilities rarely accessible to those living today. Interacting with such items is dangerous, and will forever change the wielder in unforeseen ways. These items find their ways into the collections of great and long-living creatures, such as dragons and liches, or are buried in the most remote areas beyond the known world. Not only will interacting with these items change a character, but the power released is a beacon for frightening entities linked into that same source.</p>\n<p>Some of these items are part of a set or pieces of a larger item. Collecting the various pieces will increase the PCs' powers and give them further insight into the world of mythic creatures that surrounds them. But such items are jealously guarded, and it may cost the PCs even more than they expect to attain this greater power.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenges:</strong> The PCs must face off against foes who have harnessed the same power they have, or who seek to take it from them. If the PCs' power stems from an event, perhaps they are not the only ones to gain power in this way. If their power comes from an artifact, perhaps there are other relics granting power to their enemies. In either case, the PCs must deal with foes who not only understand their power (possibly better than the PCs do), but wield it as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Ending:</strong> The heroes take on an ancient mythic creature, the very one that has been placing challenges before them. It does this not to defeat the PCs, but to force them to gain more power - power it seeks to rip from them. This foe has designs upon the power that the PCs possess and wishes to either take it all for itself or remove the threat of that power from the world.</p>"}

For example, you might transform a desert to plains. To cast this spell, you must expend 10 uses of mythic power along with the material cost. This magically alters the area's climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain, but doesn't affect creatures or the configuration of the earth. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees, but doesn't flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment.</p>\n<p>You can alter the climate by one step (warm, temperate, or cold). The maximum extent of the terrain change is up to the GM, but in general is to a similar terrain type or one step within that terrain type (such as from a typical forest to a forest with massive trees or light undergrowth, from a shallow bog to a deep bog, and so on). You might be able to shift the land to a similar terrain type, such as turning a sparse forest into a relatively dry swamp. Local creatures adversely affected by these alterations either flee the area or quickly die, depending on their mobility and awareness of the change.</p>\n<p>Multiple castings of the spell in the same area can create an area with radically different terrain and climate than the surrounding land. The GM can decide that certain terrain shifts are unsustainable and shorten the duration, or that some are suitable for the area and extend the duration.</p>\n<p>This spell could have many secondary effects based on the nature of the change, the type of bordering terrain, and so on; these should be determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis. For example, transforming a desert requires drawing water up from underground to sustain the plants, which could deplete the water table in nearby areas. Creating a warm desert in the middle of a snowy tundra will create a bordering area of mud and frequent storms from the clash of hot and cold air fronts.</p>\n<p>If you're at least 8th tier, you can expend 20 uses of mythic power instead of 10 to increase the range to 1 mile, the area to a 1-mile-radius emanation centered on you, and the duration to 1 month per caster level.</p>"}

A mythic vampire uses the base vampire's stats and abilities except as noted here.</p><p><strong>Mythic Subtype:</strong> A mythic vampire gains the mythic subtype, with a rank equal to half the CR of the base vampire. A mythic vampire gains additional abilities depending on the base vampire's CR instead of the mythic abilities it would get for having a rank. The mythic vampire gains all other benefits of having the mythic subtype: ability score bonuses, bonus hit points, mythic feats, mythic power, natural armor bonus, and spell resistance increase (if any).</p><p><strong>CR:</strong> Adjust the base vampire's CR according to its mythic rank (this template doesn't increase the base vampire's CR other than from the mythic rank). Note that a mythic vampire's abilities on Table 6-2 depend on the base vampire's CR, not the final CR of the mythic vampire.</p><p><strong>Tier:</strong> A vampire with mythic tiers that becomes a mythic vampire loses its tiers (and all abilities from those tiers) and gains abilities from the mythic vampire template, according to the base vampire's CR.</p><p><strong>Negative Energy Focus (Su):</strong> A mythic vampire's energy drain ability triggers once per successful melee attack with melee weapons or natural attacks, up to a maximum of once per round for every 2 mythic ranks the vampire has.</p><p><strong>Overcome Weakness:</strong> If a mythic vampire begins its turn in an area of direct sunlight, it is nauseated (rather than staggered), takes 10 points of damage, and loses its fast healing ability for that round. The vampire is still destroyed on the second round. At higher ranks, it can overcome or ignore other vampire weaknesses or aversions, as follows: garlic (4th rank), mirrors and holy symbols (6th rank), invitation (8th rank), running water (10th rank).</p><p><strong>Scabrous Claws (Su):</strong> As an immediate action, a mythic vampire can expend one use of mythic power to grow claws on its hands, allowing it to make claw attacks or slam attacks. The claw attacks deal the same damage as its slams (including energy drain) plus 1d6 points of bleed damage. The claws last for 1 hour or until dismissed by the vampire as a free action.</p><p><strong>Channel Resistance (Su):</strong> At 3rd rank, a mythic vampire's channel resistance increases to +8. At 6th rank, it increases to +12. At 9th rank, it increases to +16.</p><p><strong>Children of the Eclipse (Su):</strong> At 4th rank, a mythic vampire can use its children of the night ability to call forth bat swarms, rat swarms, or wolves once per hour instead of once per day. Once per day, the mythic vampire can use children of the night to call forth 2d6 ghouls or 1d6+1 shadows. At 7th rank, once per day the mythic vampire can use children of the night to call forth 1d6 wraiths or mohrgs.</p><p><strong>Mist Shapes (Su):</strong> At 5th rank, a mythic vampire can summon and sculpt mist into realistic shapes as the major image spell. A shape created in this way lasts for as long as the mythic vampire can see and concentrate upon it. In areas of particularly dense mist, this ability functions as mirage arcana instead of major image.</p><p><strong>Mastermind (Su):</strong> At 6th rank, as a standard action a mythic vampire can see, hear, and speak through the body of a creature it has dominated. The mythic vampire can use this ability indefinitely on one creature at a time, as long as it and the creature under its control remain on the same plane. A mythic vampire using this ability can't move, but is still aware of its surroundings and can end this ability as a free action.</p><p><strong>Telekinesis (Sp):</strong> At 6th rank, a mythic vampire can expend one use of mythic power to use the spell telekinesis with a caster level equal to the mythic vampire's CR.</p><p><strong>Flight (Su):</strong> At 7th rank, a mythic vampire can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to gain a fly speed equal to double its base speed (perfect maneuverability) for 1 hour. When it activates this ability, the vampire chooses whether to manifest bat-like wings or to float unnaturally. If it manifests wings, it gains a bonus on Intimidate checks equal to its rank. If it chooses to float, it gains a bonus on Stealth checks equal to its rank.</p><p><strong>Create Mythic Spawn:</strong> At 8th rank, a mythic vampire can expend one use of mythic power when using create spawn to cause the victim to rise as undead in 1 hour instead of 1d4 days. The mythic vampire can expend two uses of mythic power when using create spawn to create a mythic vampire instead of a vampire spawn or non-mythic vampire.</p><p><strong>Blood Omen (Su):</strong> At 9th rank, a mythic vampire can expend two uses of mythic power as a standard action to drain blood from all creatures within 30 feet. Each creature must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the vampire's HD + the vampire's Cha modifier) or be affected by the vampire's blood drain ability. The mythic vampire gains the normal benefits of all blood drained in this manner.</p><p><strong>Eclipse (Su):</strong> At 10th rank, a mythic vampire can expend one use of its mythic power to blot out the power of the sun in a 1-mile radius. This entire area is affected by the spell deeper darkness for 1 hour. The mythic vampire's can see through this darkness.</p><h1>Table 6-2: Mythic Vampire Abilities</h1><table><tbody><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><strong>Base Vampire's CR</strong></td><td><strong>Mythic Rank</strong></td><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Mythic Abilities</strong></td></tr><tr><td>4-5</td><td>2nd</td><td colspan=\"3\">Negative energy focus, overcome weakness (sunlight), scabrous claws</td></tr><tr><td>6-7</td><td>3rd</td><td colspan=\"3\">Channel resistance +8</td></tr><tr><td>8-9</td><td>4th</td><td colspan=\"3\">Children of the eclipse (ghouls or shadows), overcome weakness (garlic)</td></tr><tr><td>10-11</td><td>5th</td><td colspan=\"3\">Mist shapes</td></tr><tr><td>12-13</td><td>6th</td><td colspan=\"3\">Channel resistance +12, mastermind, overcome weakness (mirrors and holy symbols), telekinesis</td></tr><tr><td>14-15</td><td>7th</td><td colspan=\"3\">Children of the eclipse (wraiths or mohrgs), flight</td></tr><tr><td>16-17</td><td>8th</td><td colspan=\"3\">Create mythic spawn, overcome weakness (invitation)</td></tr><tr><td>18-19</td><td>9th</td><td colspan=\"3\">Blood omen, channel resistance +16</td></tr><tr><td>20+</td><td>10th</td><td colspan=\"3\">Eclipse, overcome weakness (running water)</td></tr></tbody></table><button style=\"width:max-content;margin-bottom:1em;\">Post Table to Chat</button></text>"}

Reading a Mythic Monster Stat Block","permission":{"default":0,"xdjh9CzHvgUgsBmZ":3},"folder":"","flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_2l6zltoe3o3","path":"Pathfinder Mythic Adventures Reference Library#/CP_SEP/Chapter 6 Mythic MonsterS#/CP_SEP/Chapter 6 Mythic MonsterS","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<p>Mythic monster stat blocks work just like non-mythic monster stat blocks, but have a few additional pieces of information. The differences are summarized in the following section.</p>\n<p><strong>Name, CR, and MR:</strong> The monster's name is presented first, along with its challenge rating (CR), its mythic rank (MR), and three icons you can use to quickly identify the creature's role in the game. The monster's CR already factors in the CR increase it gets for having mythic ranks.</p>\n<p><strong>Init and Senses:</strong> Several mythic monsters have the Mythic Improved Initiative feat (see page 67), which allows the creature to expend one use of mythic power to treat its initiative roll as a 20. Because you rarely check the Feats entry for a monster when rolling initiative, it would be easy to forget that ability when using the monster. As a reminder of this ability, a monster with that feat has a superscript \"M\" after its initiative modifier. The listed initiative modifier already includes the additional bonus from the Mythic Improved Initiative feat.</p>\n<p><strong>Feats:</strong> The creature's feats are listed here. If a monster has a mythic feat from Chapter 2, that feat is identified with a superscript \"M,\" such as \"Improved InitiativeM\" rather than \"Mythic Improved Initiative.\" Most mythic feats improve non-mythic feats, and have the non-mythic feat as a prerequisite. In these cases, the non-mythic feat isn't listed along with the mythic feat - the superscript \"M\" indicates the creature has the mythic and non-mythic versions of that feat.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> All of the monsters presented in this chapter have the mythic subtype (see page 226), which grants them the mythic power universal monster ability (see page 227), allows them to expend uses of mythic power to add surge dice to d20 rolls, and may add other abilities as well. When running a monster with mythic power, always remember that it can use the surge ability - especially because some mythic creatures don't use mythic power for anything else, so that ability is necessary for the monster to keep up with and challenge mythic PCs. (Plus, part of the fun of using mythic rules is getting to use mythic surges, and the GM should get to do that, too.)</p>\n<p><strong>Environment:</strong> The mythic monsters presented here list the same environment as the non-mythic version of the creature - by default, mythic trolls prefer cold mountains like common trolls do, and mythic owlbears prefer temperate forests like common owlbears do. Of course, you can change the environment of a mythic monster to anything appropriate for your campaign, especially if the mythic monster is unique. For example, if you want the one mythic hydra in your world to live in the desert instead of in marshes like non-mythic hydras, that change serves to make the mythic hydra even more unusual and iconic.</p>\n<p><strong>Organization:</strong> The mythic monsters presented here list the same information on organization as the non-mythic versions of the creatures. These stat blocks make no assumptions about the uniqueness or rarity of these mythic monsters in your campaign. This allows you to adapt existing encounters in printed adventures to a mythic campaign by replacing one, some, or all non-mythic creatures in a specific encounter with their mythic equivalents. For example, to challenge a group of mythic PCs in an adventure featuring an encounter with six trolls, you could replace any number of those trolls with mythic trolls - perhaps just the leader is a mythic troll, creating a slightly more difficult encounter, or perhaps all of them are mythic, resulting in a much harder challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>Treasure:</strong> Most of the mythic monsters presented here use the same treasure notation as their non-mythic counterparts. For example, trolls have standard treasure, so mythic trolls also have standard treasure. However, a mythic monster's CR will be higher than its non-mythic equivalent, so when awarding treasure you should account for the CR increase and adjust the monster's treasure accordingly. A mythic troll encountered with non-mythic trolls should have slightly better treasure because of its higher CR (just as a fiendish troll encountered with a gang of normal trolls should have better treasure). If a monster normally has Npc-type treasure (like an ogre does), the mythic version of that monster usually has better treasure than its non-mythic counterparts, since its CR is higher.</p>\n<p>Mythic monsters - especially intelligent ones - may be more likely to use magical treasures found in their lairs, perhaps out of some instinctive cunning about the item or because the item was given to the monster by the entity that granted the monster its mythic power. For example, a mythic hydra with an amulet of mighty fists +1 in its treasure hoard could be a sacred guardian created by the god of snakes, and the amulet could have been granted to the hydra by the god, giving the creature the full benefit of the item.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Abilities:</strong> These monsters include descriptions of the non-mythic monster's special abilities, so you don't need to reference the non-mythic monster in another book to use the mythic monster. In some cases, these descriptions are simplified or shortened to make room for the mythic monster's new abilities. If you have questions about how a monster's special ability works, refer to the full text of the non-mythic monster's original description in the Bestiary.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> Rather than repeating information about the original, non-mythic monster, this section presents information on the mythic version of the monster, such as suggesting how its origin or its role in the game differs from that of a non-mythic creature of its type. Unless otherwise stated, a mythic monster lives and acts very much like its non-mythic counterpart.</p>"}

Each path represents a journey into legend, and each tier in that path grants abilities and features related to that pursuit. Upon achieving his 1st mythic tier, a character must choose one mythic path to follow. Characters can choose from the following mythic paths.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[mythicadventures.mythicadventures.vKcoWoPrUgGnzzqT]{Archmage} A master of arcane magic, the archmage casts powerful spells with great skill and ease, and shapes reality at whim. The powers of the archmage allow her to alter her spells, penetrate foes' defenses, and master nearly any subject. While many of the archmage's abilities are most valuable to a character with a high Intelligence score, those with high Charisma scores will also find a wide variety of powerful options. The path of the archmage is suitable for arcane spellcasters.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[mythicadventures.mythicadventures.YE7qN1uuwc5ZrWzW]{Champion} Unparalleled in combat, the champion stands triumphant on the battlefield, surrounded by bruised and broken foes. The abilities of the champion allow him to deliver strikes more accurately, perform astounding combat maneuvers, and move effortlessly around the battlefield. Characters with a high Strength score will find this path extremely useful, as will those with a high Constitution score. The path of the champion is suitable for characters who rely on martial arms and combat maneuvers.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[mythicadventures.mythicadventures.pJcbky7xB6aigfjK]{Guardian} None can get past the impervious guardian - those who threaten this devout hero's charges are doomed to fail. The powers of the guardian allow her to hold her ground, protect her allies, prevent enemies from moving past her, and survive hits that would defeat lesser heroes. Characters that have a high Constitution score and frequently find themselves in the middle of combat gain valuable powers by becoming a guardian. The path of the guardian is suitable for those who routinely sustain massive amounts of damage.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[mythicadventures.mythicadventures.5aKep4xdcNvvhx1H]{Hierophant} Drawing on power that goes beyond the gods, the hierophant is an inviolate vessel for the divine.

The doors to the grand chamber opened and an old woman playing an ancient silver pipe entered. The attendees froze in place, unable to resist the piper's tune. As she made her way to the throne, the shadows of the king and queen rose up and seized the newborn royal, carrying the prince out through the doors with the piper following the procession. Left behind was a note instructing the kingdom to send its finest champions to the great arena in the pit of the world \"and if they survive our gladiator games, so will your kingdom.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Challenges:</strong> The PCs are called upon to venture to the arena and return the missing prince by any means necessary. Upon arriving, they realize that the arena is run by incredibly powerful devils and that the only way to succeed is to enter the games. Mythic creatures are perfect for these contests. Manticores, giants, hydras - nothing is out of reach of the organizers. The ring reforms itself for each match, reflecting the normal environs of the creature the heroes are pitted against. For one match, the environment might be a swamp, the perfect home for a hydra. For the next match, it might be a graveyard, full of fresh bodies for a talented necromancer. Another match might fill the ring with shifting sands, perfect for a mummy intent on seeking revenge against the living.</p>\n<p>There's more than one way to win, however. If the heroes convince the other contestants to band together, it's possible they could overthrow the devils, rescue the captured prince, and return home.</p>\n<p><strong>Adversary:</strong> A powerful group of devils has organized these games, ostensibly to pass the time torturing mortals by forcing them to fight for the fiends' amusement. The devils, however, have a secret agenda. Powerful auguries have told them that the heroes will be a great threat to their kind and they kidnapped the prince to lure them here. They have no actual care for the prince or his kingdom, hoping instead only to slay the heroes before they can become a threat. While the PCs may never fight the devils directly, winning in the arena ruins the fiends' plans.</p>\n<p><strong>Further Adventures:</strong> Some of the devils don't appreciate watching as their prized possessions lose in the ring. They may seek revenge against the heroes at a later date, or attempt to capture them for a repeat performance. There's still the matter of the heroes and their destiny, and it may turn out that luring them to the arena is what sets them on the course to defeating the devils.</p>"}

Some are empowered by deities or great magic and sent into the world to sow ruin and reap destruction. Others are instead relics of a bygone age when the power of creation itself flowed through the veins of every living being. Though not necessarily malevolent, these ancient creatures are a force to be respected and feared.</p>\n<p>The rules in this book assume monsters that wield mythic power are rare in the world. Such creatures fall into one of two categories: powerful versions of existing monsters and entirely new breeds of monsters. You can easily create the first type of monster by using one of the mythic simple templates presented in this section. Creating the second type of monster is more complicated, and requires adding the mythic subtype and custom abilities appropriate to the creature, with more powerful monsters gaining more abilities than weaker monsters.</p>\n<p>This chapter includes over 40 example creatures - mythic versions of cyclopes, demons, dragons, elementals, giants, medusas, and other creatures of legend - each of which represents an ancient predecessor or powerful evolution of the non-mythic version found in the Pathfinder Rpg Bestiary. Following these example monsters, this chapter continues with information on the mythic simple templates and mythic subtype, advice on how to create and balance new mythic monsters, and several new universal monster rules used by the monsters in this chapter.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

This 4-foot-long wooden pole is wrapped with three metal bands etched with elaborate cygnets and ravens - one band at the base, one in the center, and one shaped into a headpiece that forks into four sharpened tines. When recreating the ancient feasting ritual, which takes 10 minutes, a mythic creature can use the fleshhook to imbue the meat served upon its tines with his own mythic power. With each piece of meat served, the bearer can transfer one use of mythic power to the creature that eats the meat.</p>\n<p>If eaten by a mythic creature, the meat replenishes one use of mythic power. If eaten by a non-mythic creature, it grants a single use of mythic power for 24 hours. For as long as that non-mythic creature holds this use of mythic power, it's considered a mythic creature for the purposes of spells and effects, and gains both the hard to kill and surge base mythic abilities. Once that use of mythic power is spent, the creature loses these abilities and is no longer considered mythic.</p>\n<h1>Destruction</h1>\n<p>A fleshhook of mythic sustenance snaps and become useless if used to serve the rotten flesh of a mythic creature to a powerful outsider.</p>"}

It represents a power shrouded in mystery and beyond the reach of mortals. When characters encounter the mythic, they should feel as though they've just received a glimpse into an unseen world, promising so much more if they're bold enough to explore its wonders and face its dangers. A mythic atmosphere involves legends coming to life, and the characters will have a part to play in shaping these myths. If they succeed, they'll be the subject of tales and epic ballads for generations to come.</p>\n<p>Running a mythic game requires more than just allowing the players to have mythic power and face off against mythic foes. While that is certainly part of it, creating a mythic atmosphere is just as important. The world itself and the structure of the story need to change to make room for the mythic to exist alongside the normal. This change doesn't require you to reinvent the world, but mythic creatures and their environments should feel as if they are part of the world; they may be hidden, but they should still be tied to the mundane events and lands around them.</p>\n<p>Contrasting the mythic with the normal world is crucial to conveying an atmosphere of legend and mystery. The extraordinary only seems that way if it's in sharp contrast with the mundane. For example, a flying castle with a 1,000-foot-tall tower at its heart, drifting through the air on a thunderous storm cloud, is certainly a dramatic sight, but only when compared to the pastoral farmland and grime-covered town in its shadow. Picture the same floating castle in a world of towering volcanoes, and 500-foot-tall fortresses and the castle just becomes another extreme element in a world of extremes. If your game is set on Golarion (or some other established world), inserting contrasting mythic elements is easy, since the world already has a specific feel. Making your game mythic simply requires you to push beyond the boundaries of the setting, identifying hidden places where mythic elements have always dwelled, waiting to be discovered.</p>"}

If the dragon breeds, the ogres respond to the threat of hatchlings by hunting down the dragon and its offspring and fashioning armor and weapons out of their enemies' bloody remnants. Some of these families eventually develop fire resistance, a trait they pass on to their offspring.</p></text>\n            "}

For the next 10 rounds, you can apply this metamagic feat to any arcane spell you cast without increasing the spell slot used or casting time. You can also use this ability on an arcane spell you cast from a scroll, staff, or wand. You can't have more than one use of this ability active at a time. If you use this ability again, any previous use immediately ends (though this doesn't affect spells already cast). You can select this ability more than once. Each time you select this ability, the maximum spell slot level increase of the metamagic feat you can choose goes up by 1, to a maximum of 4.</p>\n<p><strong>Arcane Potency (Su):</strong> Choose one of your arcane spellcasting classes. You gain four bonus 1st-level arcane spell slots for that class (like the bonus spells gained from a high ability score). This ability doesn't change your number of spells known. You can select this ability more than once. If you choose the same arcane spellcasting class a second time, you gain four bonus 2nd-level spell slots; if you choose it again, you gain 3rd-level slots for choosing it a third time, and so on. This ability can't grant you bonus spells for a spell level that you don't have the ability to cast.</p>\n<p><strong>Bloodline Immunity (Su):</strong> The intense power of your sorcerer blood makes you immune to the weapons you rely on. You don't take damage or suffer harmful effects from spells on your bloodline spell list, even ones you aren't of a high enough level to cast. If you're targeted by any of these spells, as an immediate action you can expend one use of mythic power to turn the spell back upon the original caster as if using spell turning. Beneficial effects of spells on your bloodline spell list affect you normally. You must have the bloodline class feature to select this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Component Freedom (Ex):</strong> When you cast an arcane spell, you can ignore one component of the spell: focus, material, somatic, or verbal. You can ignore a focus or material component only if its total value is equal to or less than 100 gp &times; your tier. You can select this ability more than once; each time you take this ability, the number of components you may ignore for each spell you cast increases by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Eldritch Flight (Sp, Su):</strong> You gain a bonus on Fly checks equal to your tier. As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to fly (as the fly spell) for a number of minutes equal to your tier. At 6th tier, you instead gain a supernatural fly speed of 60 feet (40 feet if you wear medium or heavy armor, or are carrying a medium or heavy load).</p>\n<p><strong>Many Forms (Su):</strong> You can alter your appearance at will as if using alter self. You can expend one use of mythic power to change shape as if using polymorph, with a duration of 1 minute per tier. Your caster level for this ability is a number equal to 10 + your tier. At 6th tier, the duration of the polymorph ability increases to 10 minutes per tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Mirror Dodge (Su):</strong> When hit by a melee or ranged attack, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to replace yourself with an illusory duplicate and teleport to any open square within 30 feet of your current position. You take no damage from this attack, which instead destroys your illusory duplicate (similar to mirror image). Using this ability requires a line of effect to the square into which you teleport.</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Spellpower (Sp):</strong> You have a pool of magical power you can draw upon for casting mythic spells (see Chapter 3). Up to twice per day, you can use this power to cast a mythic spell without expending any uses of mythic power. You can select this ability up to three times; each time you do, you gain two additional uses of this ability per day.</p>\n<p><strong>Reverse Scrying (Su):</strong> When you notice a scrying sensor created by a scrying magical effect, you can expend one use of mythic power as a standard action to use that sensor to observe its creator. If the initial scrying effect allows the target a saving throw, the sensor's creator can attempt a saving throw with a DC equal to 10 plus double your tier to realize you are attempting to observe it and block this attempt. If you act strangely once you notice the sensor, its creator might realize you're aware of it; at the GM's discretion, you may need to attempt a Bluff check against the creator's Sense Motive. If your reverse scrying goes unnoticed, you can expend an additional use of mythic power to control what the caster perceives, as if you had cast false vision with a duration of concentration and a caster level equal to double your tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell Sieve (Sp):</strong> If you successfully counterspell an arcane spell that is on your spell list and of a level you can cast, you can absorb the countered spell's power and use it for your own purposes. On your next turn, you can cast that spell as a spell-like ability using your arcane spellcaster level as the caster level.</p>\n<p><strong>Tangible Illusion (Su):</strong> You can temporarily transform an illusory object into a real one. As a full-round action, you can expend one use of mythic power to temporarily transform a single object created by an illusion spell that you cast into a physical, nonmagical version of that object. The object lasts for 10 minutes per tier, after which it reverts to being an illusion (or vanishes, if the duration of the original illusion has expired). During that time, the illusion gains all the physical properties of the depicted illusory object. You must touch the illusion to use this ability, and the object can be no larger than 5 cubic feet per tier. For example, if you create an illusory stone door, you transform it into an actual nonmagical stone door.</p>\n<p>Special Abilities</p>"}

The spell must be on one of your arcane class spell lists and must be of a level that you can cast with that arcane spellcasting class. You don't need to have the spell prepared, nor does it need to be on your list of spells known.

Once per round when your spell resistance protects you from a spell cast by an enemy mythic creature, you regain one use of mythic power.</p>\n<p>Special Abilities</p>"}

Mythic PCs should repeatedly act in a heroic fashion, charging boldly into danger with confidence, and they should be rewarded for accomplishing such astonishing feats of daring, luck, and courage. Awarding mythic boons is one way for the GM to encourage the players to push their characters to their limits.</p>\n<p>Granting a boon is simple: when the PCs accomplish an astounding feat of bravery, cunning, or luck, they should regain one use of their mythic power (but may not exceed their total uses). This can represent different things depending on the origin: the divine smiling upon the PCs, eldritch energy surging within, or even a character's pride made manifest as actual power.</p>\n<p>When rewarding boons, the GM should reward all the PCs involved in that moment and keep these rewards balanced across the whole group. For example, if a barbarian champion charges forward and slays a powerful villain with a lucky critical hit with his axe, you might reward the barbarian, but don't neglect the rogue trickster flanking the villain with the barbarian and the bard marshal granting bonuses on the attack roll with his bardic performance as well. A character should get a boon no more than once per encounter, but the GM might waive this guideline in special circumstances.</p>\n<p>Included below are example moments worthy of a boon. This is not an exhaustive list, as any situation can result in an extraordinary outcome. These should not be automatic; if a character is built to perform critical hits, he shouldn't be rewarded every time he scores three or more in one combat, but only when he does so in extreme circumstances.</p>\n<p>Many of these boons require the character to perform the task against a mythic foe, but a suitably challenging normal foe might qualify as well, as determined by the GM. Unless otherwise specified, these moments must take place within the same encounter - the indestructible boon moment doesn't count if you survive two critical hits in one combat and one in the next, for instance.</p>\n<p><strong>Assassinate:</strong> With just a single melee or ranged attack, the character defeats a mythic creature that has its full hit point total.</p>\n<p><strong>Behind Me:</strong> The PCs defeat at least four or more creatures, but only one (or none) of the PCs takes any damage during the battle.</p>\n<p><strong>Bloodless Victory:</strong> The PCs defeat a mythic foe by dealing nonlethal damage only.</p>\n<p><strong>Calm Down:</strong> The character ends or prevents a combat against a mythic foe with a single skill check, most likely Diplomacy or Bluff.</p>\n<p><strong>Cling to Life:</strong> The character survives a single attack that deals massive damage to her (damage equal to or greater than half her maximum hit point total, minimum 50) and exceeds the DC of the subsequent Fortitude saving throw by 5 or more.</p>\n<p><strong>Close Call:</strong> The character defeats a creature that has him entangled, grappled, or swallowed whole.</p>\n<p><strong>Counter Caster:</strong> The character counterspells three or more spells from a single enemy spellcaster.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Chain:</strong> Without failing any attack rolls, the character scores three critical hits in a row.</p>\n<p><strong>Deadly Dance:</strong> In 1 round, the character provokes four or more attacks of opportunity, but none of them hit.</p>\n<p><strong>Death's Door:</strong> The character confirms a critical hit against a mythic foe while at 0 or fewer hit points.</p>\n<p><strong>Deep Breath:</strong> The character defeats a mythic foe entirely while underwater, without the aid of any spells or abilities that allow the character to breathe.</p>\n<p><strong>Desperate Measures:</strong> The character starts a combat against a mythic foe without any uses of mythic power remaining (or confidence).</p>\n<p><strong>Distant Crit:</strong> The character scores a critical hit using a ranged weapon against a target who is in the maximum range increment for the weapon.</p>\n<p><strong>Final Gift:</strong> While at 0 hit points, the character uses a spell, item, or special ability to heal an ally instead of herself, causing her to fall unconscious and gain the dying condition.</p>\n<p><strong>First to Fall:</strong> The character defeats a mythic foe at the beginning of combat, before any other creature has a chance to act.</p>\n<p><strong>Indestructible:</strong> The character survives taking three critical hits.</p>\n<p><strong>Maneuver Display:</strong> The character successfully performs at least four different combat maneuvers.</p>\n<p><strong>Mass Obliteration:</strong> Using only one spell, the character defeats six or more creatures, ending the encounter.</p>\n<p><strong>Massive Attack:</strong> The character makes a single attack against a mythic creature that deals massive damage (equal to or greater than half its total hit points, minimum 50).</p>\n<p><strong>Massive Swing:</strong> The character deals damage to five or more creatures in a single round with melee or ranged attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Master Healer:</strong> Using only a single spell, item, or ability, the character heals a dying creature to full hit points.</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Challenge:</strong> In one day, the group defeats a number of mythic creatures with a combined total mythic tier equal to or greater than 3 &times; the highest mythic tier among the characters in the party.</p>\n<p><strong>Outrageous Lie:</strong> Using Bluff, the character convinces a creature of a nearly impossible lie (-20 modifier to the check).</p>\n<p><strong>Overkill:</strong> The character uses a catapult, ballista, or ram to deal massive damage to a mythic creature (equal to or greater than half the creature's total hit points, minimum 50).</p>\n<p><strong>Performance Victory:</strong> The character uses bardic performance to inspire its allies for 8 or more rounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Pinpoint:</strong> The character makes three successful attacks against a creature that has total concealment from him.</p>\n<p><strong>Push On:</strong> The group overcomes six or more encounters without resting or regaining any abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Resilient Caster:</strong> After sustaining a critical hit while casting a spell, the character succeeds at the concentration check and defeats a foe with that spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Return to Sender:</strong> The creature catches an arrow or other projectile from a ranged attack and uses it to make a successful hit on the attacker within 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Savant:</strong> The character succeeds at a skill check with a DC of 20 or higher when he rolled a natural 5 or lower.</p>\n<p><strong>School Display:</strong> The character casts at least one spell from each school of magic (not counting spells that are two or more levels below the highest level of spell he can cast).</p>\n<p><strong>Shield Ally:</strong> Using path abilities, the character prevents an ally from taking any damage from an attack at least three times.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Supremacy:</strong> The character exceeds the DC of a skill check by 20 or more.</p>\n<p><strong>Solo Warrior:</strong> The character defeats a mythic creature without assistance from any allies, including animal companions, cohorts, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Swift Doom:</strong> The character defeats a mythic creature with a single spell on the first round of combat, before it has a chance to act.</p>\n<p><strong>Swift Victory:</strong> The group defeats an encounter in a single round.</p>\n<p><strong>Tumbler:</strong> In 1 round, the character uses Acrobatics to move through the threatened areas of at least five foes without provoking any attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p><strong>Undead Bane:</strong> With a single use of channel energy, the character defeats eight or more undead creatures or four or more mythic undead.</p>\n<p><strong>Unstoppable:</strong> The character suffers the effects of at least three of the following conditions at the same time while in combat with a mythic foe: blinded, confused, deafened, disabled, exhausted, frightened, nauseated, paralyzed, pinned, and stunned.</p>\n<p><strong>Wild Warrior:</strong> While using wild shape or some other polymorph effect, the character defeats a mythic foe.</p>\n<p><strong>Wrestler:</strong> The character reverses a grapple against a foe and pins that foe on the following turn.</p>"}

This sabotage is a sunder combat maneuver that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Add your tier to your Cmb when attempting this maneuver. If you succeed, you can give the broken condition to a single item the opponent is wielding or carrying. This attack doesn't deal any damage to the object. The condition can be removed by spending 1 minute undoing the sabotage, or instantaneously with mending or a similar spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Skill (Su):</strong> Whenever you roll a natural 20 on a skill check, you perform that skill with exceptional proficiency. Typically, this means that the task takes half the normal amount of time to accomplish. If the skill would normally take a full-round action, it instead takes a standard action. If it would normally take a standard or move action, it instead takes a swift action. If it would normally take a swift or free action, it instead takes no time at all. The GM might rule that instead of reducing the amount of time needed, using the skill takes the normal amount of time but the critical success results in some other added benefit, depending on the skill being used and the situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Fickle Attack (Ex):</strong> Whenever you roll damage for a melee or ranged attack with a weapon or alchemical item, you can treat any natural 1s on the damage dice as if they were the highest possible number on those dice. You can select this ability up to three times. The second time you select it, treat 1s and 2s as the highest value. The third time, treat 1s, 2s, and 3s as the highest value.</p>\n<p><strong>Menacing Whisper (Ex):</strong> Whenever you're adjacent to a creature that can't see you (whether through Stealth, magic, or the creature being unable to see) but can hear you, as a swift action you can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize that creature. You can expend one use of mythic power as a free action to give such a creature a suggestion. The save DC against this effect is 10 + your tier + your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Mirror Dodge (Su):</strong> When hit by a melee or ranged attack, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to replace yourself with an illusory duplicate and teleport to any open square within 30 feet of your current position. You take no damage from this attack, which instead destroys your illusory duplicate (similar to mirror image). Using this ability requires a line of effect to the teleportation target square.</p>\n<p><strong>Perfect Lie (Ex):</strong> When telling a lie, you can expend one use of mythic power to make the lie indiscernible from the truth by both Sense Motive and magic. Obvious proof of your falsehood still reveals the lie for what it is, but in absence of proof, those who hear your lie believe it.</p>\n<p><strong>Perfect Mimic (Su):</strong> You can use the Disguise skill as a full-round action. When you attempt to impersonate a specific person, those familiar with the individual receive only half the normal bonus from familiarity to see through your disguise. If you expend one use of mythic power when creating a disguise to impersonate an individual, you can read that creature's mind as if using detect thoughts with a range of 1 mile. This allows you to better mimic the individual, granting you a further +10 bonus on opposed Disguise skill checks. The target of your impersonation receives a Will saving throw (DC 10 + your tier + your Charisma modifier) to negate the detect thoughts aspect of this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Sardonic Wit (Su):</strong> You know exactly when to lighten the mood and help shake off the doldrums. As a move action, you can expend one use of mythic power to remove a single mind-affecting effect from one creature within 30 feet. This ability doesn't work on effects with an instantaneous or permanent duration.</p>\n<p><strong>Vanishing Move (Su):</strong> When you wish to not be seen, you aren't. As a swift action, you can make yourself invisible until the end of your turn. This effect ends if you do anything other than move. If you expend one use of mythic power when using this ability, it instead acts as greater invisibility using double your tier as your caster level.</p>\n<p>Special Abilities</p>"}

A creature with sufficient power and knowledge can bind the Trueforge to a fixed location to best take advantage of its power.</p>\n<p>Labor at the Trueforge requires both supreme skill and mythic power. Non-mythic creatures are affected as the feeblemind spell (DC 30) for daring to use the forge, and can't use the forge's abilities even if they succeed at their saving throws.</p>\n<p>When toiling at the Trueforge, a mythic creature can create magical weapons and armor with a cost up to her mythic tier squared times 2,000 gp, ignoring the nonmagical cost of the item created. For example, a 10th-tier character could craft a magic weapon of a +10 enhancement equivalent, worth 200,000 gp plus the cost of the weapon itself. The item forged must be at least partially metal, such as a breastplate or spear. Creating such an item requires only half the usual value of raw materials. However, to create items involving exotic materials (such as adamantine), the creator must use and have access to the normal amount of the material.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the materials involved, it takes 1 day of labor to forge a nonmagical light or one-handed weapon, shield, or suit of light armor; 2 days to forge a suit of medium armor or two-handed weapon; and 3 days to forge a suit of heavy armor. For items with magical properties, square the number of days of labor and multiply by 1,000 to determine the total gold piece value. For example, completing an item with magical properties worth 144,000 gp or less requires 12 days of work. The crafter must labor continuously on the item, not sleeping until work is completed, though she's kept awake and vigorous through the magic of the forge. If the work is interrupted for more than 1 hour at a time or more than 2 hours in a single day, the item is ruined, and half the value of the raw materials wasted.</p>\n<p>In addition to making normal and magical weapons and armor, the Trueforge can repair a broken magic item, generally in half the number of days it would take to make it from scratch. It can even repair or create an artifact, though such a task requires months of preparation to gather the proper materials followed by weeks of labor at the forge.</p>\n<p>Only one person can work the forge at a time. As the crafter labors, the Trueforge feeds on her mythic power and life energy, drawing it into the item forged. Forging nonmagical items carries less risk. The crafter must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save at the start of each day of work or gain 2 permanent negative levels. For magic items, the save DC is equal to 25 plus the number of days worked thus far. At the start of each day of labor, the crafter must expend a number of uses of mythic power equal to the number of days worked so far plus one.</p>\n<p>If the crafter accumulates a number of negative levels equal to her own character level or exhausts her mythic power, the labor proves fatal at the end of the day. Normally, this ruins the work in progress, but if this occurs on the final day of work, the crafter finishes the item as she dies. Her soul enters the item, making it an intelligent item with the crafter's personality - and likely some of her abilities, as determined by the GM.</p>\n<p>Creatures immune to level drain, whether by innate nature or magical protection, can't use the Trueforge.</p>\n<h1>Destruction</h1>\n<p>The Trueforge can be destroyed by first destroying every object forged by it, then shattering the forge with a single blow from a hammer of thunderbolts.</p>"}

In this theme, the amount of mythic power is finite; to gain more, one must take it from another.</p>\n<p><strong>Scope:</strong> The amount of mythic power in the world is limited, but the actual amount can vary depending on the needs of the campaign. Maybe there are many mythic beings scattered throughout the world, some secret and others overt about their mythic nature. Or there are few such people in the world, but each one is a force to be reckoned with. Regardless, there are those with power who forever crave more, while others are merely content to possess what power they have and to use it wisely. The PCs must decide how to handle their power, whether or not to seek out more, and how to deal with those who come to take theirs away.</p>\n<p><strong>Ascension:</strong> After the heroes defeat a particularly powerful foe, a storm of lightning emerges from his body, washing over the PCs and granting them mythic power. They quickly learn that to gain additional tiers, they must defeat other mythic foes and harvest power from them.</p>\n<p>The PCs are summoned to a lonely mountaintop where an ancient monk awaits. Before succumbing to old age, the monk grants them the mythic power that he's held for many years, entrusting them to guard it and carry on his legacy.</p>\n<p>A strange messenger from a mysterious cult approaches the PCs and offers them membership. They're brought to a strange ritual and infused with mythic power stolen from a bound captive. They soon learn that the cult they have joined is in an eternal struggle with their rivals, both sides playing a centuries-long game of stealing power from the other using this ancient ritual.</p>\n<p>After some chance omen, the PCs wake up with mythic power. They discover that this very power means they're now a part of a secret world, one where other mythic beings now hunt them down to kill them for what they possess. It's through a chance meeting with a friendly mythic character that the PCs understand what has befallen them.</p>\n<p><strong>Story:</strong> The PCs might go on plenty of regular adventures in this theme, but every encounter they have with a mythic creature or character is fraught with peril. These rivals might seek to steal their power, or help explain how their power might be used. The PCs will have to decide if taking it is something they can morally accept. If gaining mythic power requires the death of others who possess it, the power itself becomes a sort of curse, with villains around every corner seeking to end the PCs' lives and steal their mythic spark.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Mythic foes will be relatively uncommon in this theme, because each successful encounter with one causes the PCs to increase in power. As they gain tiers, the PCs might discover that slaying a being of lesser tier is not enough to advance their power. Or perhaps the highest tiers are only possible to those willing to kill a great many mythic creatures, collecting all that power into one body. The PCs must constantly be vigilant for other mythic foes, both above them in power and below.</p>\n<p><strong>Ending:</strong> Ultimately, the PCs will reach the 10th tier and be left with no more to gain. From this lofty perch, they must defend themselves from all mythic threats seeking to steal what they have earned. Alternatively, those who reach that height of power might find there is only one more step to take - stealing more power from a deity or other source of immense power. Or there may be a grand reward awaiting those who capture all the mythic power in the world.</p>"}

For example, a 5th-level wizard/1st-tier archmage can target up to six creatures when casting haste (five from caster level 5th and one from 1st tier). Alternatively, you can expend one use of mythic power when casting a spell that affects only one target (such as \"one creature\") to have the spell affect an additional target. If the spell requires you to succeed at a melee touch attack, you must hold the charge (Core Rulebook 185) in order to make a second touch attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Arcane Endurance (Ex):</strong> Treat your caster level as 4 higher when determining the duration of spells you cast. This doesn't alter any other variable effects of the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Bloodline Intensity (Su):</strong> Your mythic power intensifies your sorcerer bloodline. Select an additional bloodline feat from your bloodline's list of feats. You must meet the prerequisites for that feat. You can also cast each of your bloodline spells once per day without them counting toward the number of spells you can cast per day. You must have the bloodline class feature to select this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Competent Caster (Ex):</strong> You automatically succeed at concentration checks to cast arcane spells. This ability doesn't apply to spells of the highest spell level you can cast.</p>\n<p><strong>Coupled Arcana (Ex):</strong> Whenever you spend a standard action, move action, or swift action to activate an arcane school power, bardic performance, bloodline power, hex, or magus arcana, you can also activate an ability that uses mythic power as a free action. The mythic ability you activate must require the same action type as the other ability you activated or faster (a swift action is faster than a move action, and a move action is faster than a standard action).</p>\n<p><strong>Crafting Mastery (Ex):</strong> You can craft any magic item as if you had the necessary item creation feats. If you actually have the item creation feat needed for a magic item you're crafting, whenever you attempt a skill check to create that item, roll twice and use the higher result, and you make twice as much progress on the item for any time spent. This ability does not reduce the item's cost or any other requirements.</p>\n<p><strong>Deep Understanding (Ex):</strong> You automatically identify any arcane spell cast within 60 feet of you if it's on your class's spell list and you're of a high enough level to cast it. Whenever you attempt to identify a non-artifact magic item using detect magic, you automatically learn its properties and command words in the first round of the spell (no Spellcraft roll needed), but you can't automatically determine whether it's cursed.</p>\n<p><strong>Eldritch Breach (Su):</strong> You are adept at breaching magical defenses and overcoming resistance to your magic. When attempting a caster level check to dispel an effect, overcome spell resistance, or otherwise determine whether your magic affects a target (such as with knock or neutralize poison), roll twice and take the higher result.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Bond (Su):</strong> You are connected to one of the elemental planes. Select one elemental plane: air, earth, fire, or water. Whenever you cast a spell with a descriptor matching that plane, add your tier to your caster level for that spell. You gain resistance 10 against an energy type associated with your chosen plane - electricity for air, acid for earth, fire for fire, and cold for water. At 6th tier, this resistance increases to 20. At 9th tier, this resistance increases to 30.</p>\n<p><strong>Enduring Armor (Su):</strong> You are protected by armor made of force. This armor grants you an armor bonus to AC equal to 3 + your tier. This ability is an abjuration effect with a spell level equal to your tier. If this armor is dispelled or otherwise ended, you can reactivate it as a swift action.</p>\n<p><strong>Energy Conversion (Su):</strong> Whenever you cast a spell with the acid, cold, electricity, or fire descriptor, you can expend one use of mythic power to switch the energy type to a different one of those energy types. If the spell normally has its original energy type as a descriptor, it loses that descriptor and gains the new type as a descriptor. All other effects of the spell remain unchanged.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhance Magic Items (Ex):</strong> Your mythic presence enhances the power of certain magic items. Add half your tier to the caster level of potions, scrolls, staves, and wands you use. When using a staff or wand, you may activate the item by expending one use of mythic power instead of one of the item's charges.</p>\n<p><strong>Flash of Omniscience (Ex):</strong> Your ability to recall information is astounding. When you take 10 on any Intelligence-based skill check, add your tier to the result. As a free action, you can expend one use of mythic power to ask one question as if using divination. The base chance for a correct answer is 70% + your highest arcane caster level + your tier (maximum 100%). The answer doesn't come from a divine agent, but from your own native understanding; therefore, the answer is never cryptic. If you don't get a correct answer, it's like failing a Knowledge check, and you can't use this ability on this question again.</p>\n<p><strong>Flexible Counterspell (Su):</strong> Your mythic power enhances your ability to counter others' spells. As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to attempt to counter a spell. This ability otherwise works like readying an action to counter a spell, except instead of using the exact spell or dispel magic, you can instead expend a spell or spell slot of a level equal to or higher than the target spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Flexible School (Ex):</strong> Select one wizard arcane school that is not your arcane school. You gain powers from that arcane school, treating your tier as your wizard level for the purposes of these powers. Once you have chosen the arcane school, it cannot be changed. You cannot select an arcane school that is one of your opposition schools. You must have the arcane school class feature to select this ability. You can choose this ability up to three times, each time selecting another arcane school other than your own.</p>\n<p><strong>Greater Familiar Link (Su):</strong> You have bound yourself so deeply to your familiar that your life forces are intertwined. Anytime you or your familiar takes damage, you may split the damage evenly between you and your familiar as if using shield other. Using this ability doesn't require an action, but it works only if you're conscious and both you and your familiar are alive. You must have a familiar to select this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Harmonious Mage (Ex):</strong> Your wizardly studies have moved beyond the concept of opposition schools. Select two opposition schools. These are no longer opposition schools for you, preparing spells from one of these schools now only requires one spell slot of the appropriate level instead of two, and you no longer take the -4 Spellcraft penalty for crafting items from an opposition school. You must have the arcane school class ability to select this ability, and your arcane school can't be universal.</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Bloodline (Su):</strong> When determining the effects of your bloodline powers, you're considered 4 levels higher. This increases the effects of powers you have access to, but doesn't grant you powers at a lower level than normal. If you have a sorcerer bloodline power that can be used multiple times per day, such as metamagic adept, you gain a number of extra uses of that power equal to half your tier (minimum 1). You must have the bloodline class feature to select this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Hexes (Su):</strong> Your hexes are more effective against non-mythic targets. When you use a hex that requires a saving throw against a non-mythic target, that target is automatically affected for 1 round (which doesn't count toward the hex's duration) and can't attempt a saving throw to resist the hex. On your turn the next round, the creature attempts its saving throw as normal. If it succeeds at this saving throw, it breaks free of the hex; otherwise, it's affected as normal. You must have the hex class feature to select this ability. You can select this ability twice. If you select it a second time, it also affects your major hexes.</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic School (Su):</strong> When determining the effects of your arcane school powers, you're considered 4 levels higher. This increases the effects of powers you have access to, but doesn't grant you powers at a lower level than normal. If you have an arcane school power that can be used multiple times per day, such as blinding ray, you gain a number of extra uses of that power equal half your tier (minimum 1). You must have the arcane school class feature to select this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Perfect Preparation (Ex):</strong> You have discovered the secret to preparing spells without having to refer to outside sources. You no longer need to prepare spells from a spellbook (if you're a magus or wizard) or a familiar (if you're a witch). You still must spend the normal amount of time preparing spells. You may keep or discard your spellbook or familiar.</p>\n<p><strong>Rapid Preparation (Su):</strong> You can prepare a spell in an open spell slot in only 1 minute instead of the normal 15 minutes. You can prepare spells in all of your available spell slots in only 15 minutes instead of the normal 1 hour. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to instantly prepare one spell in an open spell slot.</p>\n<p><strong>Resilient Arcana (Su):</strong> Your spells and effects become more difficult to identify and dispel. Add your tier to the DC of any checks to identify your spells, recognize them as they are being cast, or dispel them using dispel magic or similar effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Sensory Link (Su):</strong> As a standard action, you can see and hear through your familiar's eyes and ears. While using this ability, you can't see or hear using your normal senses. You can speak through your familiar using any language you know, even if the familiar can't normally speak. You may end the link and restore your own senses as a standard action. While linked, you can expend one use of mythic power to cast a spell and have it originate from your familiar instead of you. You must have a familiar to select this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Shifting Mastery (Su):</strong> Whenever you cast or use an arcane polymorph spell, you can grant the target the ability to expend 1 minute of the spell's duration to assume another form allowed by the spell. Changing form in this way is a standard action. The target can assume another form as often as it likes for the duration of the spell. If you're the target, you can change forms as a swift action rather than a standard action. If you expend one use of mythic power when you cast the spell, you can also grant the target the ability to assume the shape of one specific individual that the spell could duplicate (for example, the target could use polymorph to assume the form of a specific animal, humanoid, or elemental, but not a dragon because dragon forms aren't allowed by polymorph). This specific creature must be known to you, but it doesn't have to be known by the target. The target gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to pass as that individual, but Bluff checks or knowledge of the individual might be required to make the disguise truly convincing.</p>\n<p><strong>Speedy Summons (Su):</strong> When you cast a summon monster spell, the casting time is 1 standard action instead of 1 round. If you expend one use of mythic power, the casting time becomes 1 swift action. If you're a summoner, as a full-round action you can expend one use of mythic power to summon your eidolon. You must be at least 3rd tier to select this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Spellbane Counterstrike (Su):</strong> With a quick sprint, you retaliate against the caster of a spell you countered. When you successfully counter a spell, you can move up to your speed as part of the counterspell action, as long as you end your movement with the target of the counterspell within melee reach. Your movement from this ability doesn't count toward your total movement for the round. If the target's casting would have provoked an attack of opportunity, you can immediately take an attack of opportunity against the target.</p>\n<p><strong>Telekinetic Master (Su):</strong> You can use mage hand or open/close at will as a standard action, and you can affect unattended magical objects with mage hand. The weight limit for these abilities increases by 5 pounds per tier. Treat your caster level as 2 levels higher when casting levitate, telekinesis, and similar spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Throw Spell (Su):</strong> When casting a melee touch spell, you can expend one use of mythic power to throw that spell as a ranged touch attack. The range of this thrown spell is 10 feet per tier. If the spell allows you to make multiple melee touch attacks, you may make any number of the attacks as melee touch attacks and throw the rest as you see fit.</p>\n<p>Special Abilities</p>"}

We burn together on three. One... two...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Chapter 3: Mythic Spells</h1>\n<p>Mythic spells draw upon the caster's mythic power to create more powerful magical effects - mythic fireball sets affected creatures on fire, mythic mage armor can negate critical hits, and so on. These spells aren't separate spells you gain as a spell known from your spellcasting class, but rather mythically charged versions of spells you already know.</p>\n<p><strong>Learning Mythic Spells:</strong> To learn a mythic spell, you must either select the mythic spellcasting universal path ability (see page 50) or the Mythic Spell Lore feat (see page 70). In doing so, you unlock the secret of using your mythic power to amplify non-mythic spells you choose.</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Mythic Spells:</strong> If you know the mythic version of a spell, any time you cast the spell, you may expend one use of mythic power to convert the spell into its mythic version as you cast it. This doesn't change the level of the spell slot you use to cast the spell.</p>\n<p>If you're a caster who prepares spells (such as a cleric or wizard), you never have to prepare the mythic version of a spell - if you prepare the non-mythic version, you may cast it as the mythic version by expending one use of mythic power. Unless otherwise specified, casting the mythic version of a spell doesn't take any longer than casting the non-mythic version.</p>\n<p><strong>Effects of Mythic Spells:</strong> Unless otherwise specified, a mythic spell works just like the non-mythic version of the spell. For example, zombies created by both animate dead and mythic animate dead count toward the spell's HD limit of how many undead you can control at one time, and a chaotic creature is immune to mythic chaos hammer in the same way it's immune to chaos hammer.</p>\n<p>Unless a mythic spell's description says it improves, replaces, or upgrades an effect of the non-mythic spell, or says that it creates an effect instead of the non-mythic spell's effect, it retains all the effects of the non-mythic spell in addition to the effects of the mythic version. For example, the mythic blasphemy spell has penalties for creatures that fail their saves; because the description doesn't indicate that these penalties replace those of non-mythic blasphemy, the penalties are in addition to the non-mythic spell's effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented Mythic Spells:</strong> An augmented version of a mythic spell has the same effect as the mythic spell, plus additional benefits, options, or an increased effect. Some augmented effects require you to have a minimum tier in order to cast it as an augmented mythic spell. If so, the tier requirement for the augmented effects is listed in parentheses in the entry. For example, \"Augmented (4th)\" means you must have at least 4 mythic tiers to use this option. If you know a mythic spell, you automatically know how to cast the augmented version of that mythic spell upon reaching the required tier.</p>\n<p>Casting the augmented version of a mythic spell requires you to expend more uses of mythic power when you cast it.</p>\n<p>The number of additional uses required for the augmented version is listed in the spell's augmented entry and includes the one use of mythic power necessary to cast the mythic version of the spell. When you cast a spell, you must decide whether you want to cast the non-mythic version, the mythic version, or the augmented mythic version, and expend the appropriate number of uses of mythic power. You can't cast the non-mythic version of the spell and later expend one use of mythic power to change it to the mythic version, nor can you cast the base mythic version of a spell and later in the duration expend the difference in mythic power to change it to the augmented version.</p>\n<p><em>Example:</em> You're a 9th-level wizard/6th-tier archmage who knows mythic animate dead and has animate dead prepared. Casting animate dead works as normal and requires no uses of mythic power. Casting mythic animate dead requires you to expend one use of mythic power when you cast your prepared animate dead. Casting the augmented version of mythic animate dead requires you to expend two (not three) uses of mythic power when you cast your prepared animate dead spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Spells in Magic Items:</strong> Mythic spells can't be crafted into magic items unless the item is an artifact (for example, you can't brew a potion of mythic cure light wounds).</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Spells in Stat Blocks:</strong> In a creature stat block, a superscript \"M\" indicates the creature knows the mythic version of the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Potent:</strong> Any spell you cast as a mythic spell can also be cast in a potent form that is harder to resist. By expending one additional use of mythic power, you increase the spell's save DC by 2 and gain a +2 bonus on your caster level check to overcome spell resistance.</p>\n<p><strong>Resilient:</strong> Any spell you cast as a mythic spell can also be cast in a resilient form that is harder to dispel or counterspell. Expend one additional use of mythic power; any check attempted in order to dispel the spell then takes a -4 penalty, and the spell can't be countered unless the opposing caster also expends a use of mythic power to overcome your spell's resilience (in which case the normal rules for counterspelling apply).</p>\n<p>You may combine the potent and resilient forms of a spell; to do so, you must expend a total of two additional uses of mythic power. You can cast potent and resilient forms of augmented mythic spells in the same manner.</p>\n<p><strong>Tiers in Mythic Spell Descriptions:</strong> Unless otherwise stated, any reference to tier in a mythic spell description refers to the tier of the creature casting the spell. Whenever a mythic spell refers to half your tier, the minimum is 1 (meaning you still get a benefit at 1st tier).</p>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> The name of the book in which the original spell's description appears is listed here. If no source line is included, the original spell appears in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Mythic Spells</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[mythicadventures.mythicadventures.Bnzc0MXQocNg7us9]{3.1.0.

If the target is using winged flight, the spike snares its wings. The target is considered grappled by the manticore (though the manticore is not considered to be grappling) and must escape the grapple to move from its square. A flying creature must escape on its turn or plummet to the ground. As a swift action, a mythic manticore can expend one use of mythic power to skewer all targets hit by its spikes that turn, even if the attacks weren't critical hits.</p><p><strong>Spikes (Ex):</strong> With a snap of its tail, a mythic manticore can loose a volley of four spikes as a standard action (make an attack roll for each spike). This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other. The creature can launch only 24 spikes in any 24-hour period.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>A mythic manticore is a nightmarish creature, perhaps the result of crossbreeding with poisonous drakes, decadent sphinxes, or aberrant chimeras. A voracious eater, a mythic manticore may devour an entire corpse, as well as its weapons and armor, leaving nothing but a bloody stain on the ground and a few organs it finds unpalatable. Any metal bits it eats are digested and used to grow its deadly spikes. Some are known to dine on giant venomous snakes and spiders with the intent of making their poison even more powerful.</p><p>A mythic manticore uses its thrown spikes to hold prey in place from a distance so it can leap upon it and tear it apart. It is especially fond of skewering the wings of a flying creature, forcing it to plummet to the ground where it becomes easy pickings. Its weakness-inducing poison makes it especially dangerous to winged mounts, as the poisoned creature may find itself unable to carry a rider.</p></text>\n            "}

Mythic tiers are similar to levels in a class or prestige class in that the powers gained at each tier are added to all those that came before, but tiers are gained in a different manner from levels. A character gains a new mythic tier by completing a number of trials that occur during play. A trial is a difficult task that adds to the legend and story of your character. Achieving a new mythic tier occurs independently of experience point progression (though you will also gain experience points for the various encounters you complete as you progress through your trials).</p>\n<p>Trials are moments in the story when you must rise above the deeds of lesser heroes. These moments become critical junctures in your legend. The GM decides what qualifies as a trial, and it's up to you to complete it as you would other adventures. You might not even know you are attempting a trial until it is completed and the GM informs you to note it on your mythic character sheet (see page 248), though you'll likely get an inkling when you find yourself facing a particularly challenging foe or attempting something that most would find impossible.</p>\n<p>The number of trials required to attain each new tier appears on @Compendium[mythicadventures.mythicadventures.ux6g0tj3g6Sy2ffJ]{Table 1-2: Mythic Trials Per Tier}. For example, suppose a 5th-level fighter discovers her mythic heritage and becomes a 1st-tier champion. Over a number of sessions, she earns enough experience points to gain her 6th level of fighter. During this time, she doesn't complete a trial, so she doesn't advance to the next tier of the champion path. During the next session, however, she engages in a climactic battle against a mythic troll that has plagued the town for years; by defeating the troll, she completes her trial, allowing her to become a 2nd-tier champion. To reach 3rd tier, she will need to accomplish two more trials. A mythic character can't gain more than 10 tiers.</p>\n<p>Note that the number of trials needed to achieve the next tier might vary from the number listed on Table 1-2. The GM can reduce or increase this number as needed to suit the campaign - refer to the @Compendium[mythicadventures.mythicadventures.tfazy62dxarfxrt3]{Mythic Trials} section in Chapter 4 for more guidance (see page 129).</p>"}

Many such legendary beings have equally legendary flaws that are ultimately their undoing. Because of the heroes' great power, these failings and weaknesses are also often dramatic, and if their enemies learn of these flaws, they will seek to exploit them.</p>\n<p>The following mythic flaws are optional rules the GM may want to include in a mythic campaign in order to reflect heroes of old. They force characters to suffer a particular ailment in certain situations, one that they can't mitigate or work off over time - a flaw truly a part of their mythic nature.</p>\n<p>Flaws don't provide great benefits to the characters - including them is purely for dramatic purposes, not to create an optimal character. The GM should carefully weigh whether or not to include them in the game, and decide if their addition is a benefit to the story as a whole and (more importantly) something the players will enjoy playing.</p>\n<p>If you decide to include mythic flaws in the game, they are gained at the same time the character gains mythic power, during the moment of ascension. You can select these flaws yourself, making them an aspect of the theme used to grant the PCs mythic power, or you can allow the PCs to select them, integrating the flaws into their backstories. The following mythic flaws are examples of the types of flaws you could include in your game.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Dependency</h1>\n<p>There is only one food or drink that can nourish your hero, and without it your powers fade. Select one specific type of food or drink (other than water). If you don't ingest that food or drink at least once per day, you begin to lose your mythic powers. After the first day of absence, you can no longer regain uses of mythic power. After the second day, you lose all the powers and abilities granted by your mythic path. After the third day, you lose all of your mythic abilities, with the exception of ability score increases, bonus hit points, and bonus mythic feats. These powers and abilities are immediately restored as soon as you consume that food or drink.</p>\n<h1>Elemental Vulnerability</h1>\n<p>One element above all others has an adverse effect on your power and is capable of harming you like no other. Select either acid, cold, electricity, or fire. You take double the amount of damage whenever that damage is of the selected type. You never benefit from resistance or immunity to that element. When an effect of that type is used against you, it is always treated as though it's from a mythic source.</p>\n<h1>Furious Rage</h1>\n<p>Your rage is a beast, one that you can barely control. Whenever you are hit by a critical hit or demoralized by the Intimidate skill, you go into an uncontrollable rage. This functions like the barbarian's rage class feature, but you don't gain a bonus to your Strength or Constitution score (even if you have the rage class feature). This limits the actions you can perform and gives you a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1d4 plus your mythic tier, but you aren't fatigued after this duration expires. If you have the rage class feature, this does not count toward your uses of that feature. If you are raging when this flaw is triggered, that rage immediately ends and this effect begins.</p>\n<h1>Hubris</h1>\n<p>You are first, best, and above all others. Your power is unrivaled and you know it. You receive a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear. Whenever you succeed at a saving throw against an effect that would have caused you to gain the shaken, frightened, or panicked condition, you instead gain the staggered condition for a duration equal to the duration of the effect that you saved against, as you spend part of each round boasting about your prowess. If you instead fail a saving throw against such an effect, that effect's duration is doubled as you're also confronted with doubt or shame.</p>\n<h1>Material Weakness</h1>\n<p>There is one material that can penetrate even your toughest defenses. Select cold iron, silver, or wood. Weapons made primarily from that material automatically confirm all critical hits against you and the critical multiplier is increased by 1 (to a maximum of &times;4). If you have damage reduction, weapons made primarily of that type always bypass that reduction.</p>\n<h1>Mercurial Mind</h1>\n<p>The power that you wield speaks to you, and it befuddles your mind at critical moments. Whenever you're hit by a critical hit or fail a saving throw against a mind-affecting spell or special ability, you also gain the confused condition for 1d4 rounds.</p>\n<h1>School Aversion</h1>\n<p>Despite your power, there is one type of magic that is foretold to be your undoing. Those that wield it are of great danger to you. Select one school of magic (except divination). Whenever you attempt a saving throw against a spell or effect of that school, you take a -4 penalty on the saving throw. The effects of such spells (if harmful) last twice as long if you fail the saving throw. In addition, all spells and effects of that school used against you are always treated as though they're from a mythic source. You also may not benefit from spells and effects from the selected school, subject to GM discretion.</p>\n<h1>Weapon Weakness</h1>\n<p>The prophecies say that one weapon will be your doom. Select one group of weapons from the list of fighter weapons. Weapons from the selected group gain a +4 bonus on attack and damage rolls against you. If a weapon from the selected group scores a critical hit against you, the critical multiplier is increased by 1 (to a maximum of &times;4). If you have damage reduction, weapons from that group always bypass that reduction.</p>"}

The Apocalypse Box appears subtly, sometimes as a dusty old box on a shelf or a forgotten heirloom in a grandparent's attic. A creature looking upon the Apocalypse Box is struck with a sensation of nearly overwhelming avarice, and must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be compelled to touch the box. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. If a creature touches the Apocalypse Box, she must succeed at another DC 30 Will save or fall under the box's curse. Cursed creatures are compelled to use any available means - including fleeing from or murdering friends and loved ones - to keep the box out of the hands of others. This curse can't be broken until the cursed creature dies or the box is destroyed. Additionally, if the cursed creature moves more than 10 feet away from the box, she immediately takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage plus 1d4 points of Wisdom damage each subsequent day until she and the Apocalypse Box are reunited.</p>\n<p>Only a creature bearing the Apocalypse Box's curse can open it. Once per day, the cursed creature can open the box and draw forth a single item her heart desires. The item must be nonmagical, weigh no more than 50 pounds, and be worth no more than 50,000 gp, but is otherwise limited only by the parameters of the wish spell. A mythic character can expend two uses of mythic power to draw forth a second such item each day.</p>\n<p>Each time the Apocalypse Box is opened, there is a 50% chance that instead of granting a wish, the box summons a number of horrific monsters that immediately attack anyone in sight and remain to wreak havoc on the Material Plane for 1 week before returning to their plane of origin. Roll on Table 5-1 below to determine the monsters that appear.</p>\n<p>The Apocalypse Box is quite tenacious in its desire for someone to open it. Each day, the cursed creature must succeed at a Will save or be compelled to open it. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is initially 20, but increases by 2 each subsequent day the box isn't opened until the cursed creature fails the Will save, at which point she opens the box and the save DC resets to 20.</p>\n<h1>Destruction</h1>\n<p>The Apocalypse Box can be destroyed by being crushed under the claw of an ancient gold dragon after a creature cursed by the box defeats three groups of Apocalypse Box monsters in a single day. The act of crushing the box immediately slays the gold dragon, who can't be returned to life short of divine intervention.</p>\n<p>@RollTable[Ei0RnJjlBpLz4ftL] <strong>Table 5-1:</strong> Apocalypse Box Monsters</p>"}

Ultimately, it's up to the GM to decide how much influence these rules have on the campaign and world as a whole. The following types of scale are provided to give GMs an easy guideline for incorporating mythic rules into their games.</p>\n<p><strong>Rare:</strong> At this scale, mythic creatures live only in remote parts of the world, content to be bygones of a lost age. People speak of them in stories, but none have actually encountered them. The PCs are not themselves mythic in this type of campaign, but throughout their travels, they may be up against a mythic creature at the conclusion of a noteworthy quest. Alternatively, a mythic creature might be forced into the world to terrorize the land, driving the PCs to find a way to deal with such a powerful threat.</p>\n<p><strong>Limited:</strong> At the limited scale, the PCs get a taste of mythic power through some extraordinary event, albeit only for a short time. For the duration of an adventure or short campaign arc, they can wield this power to further their goals. Unfortunately, it's fleeting, and they soon become normal once again, perhaps with a few remnants of power they might call on in a future time of need. Perhaps their power will return at a later date - possibly even regularly according to some mysterious cycle, allowing them to plan out when they take on more difficult challenges coinciding with their resurgence of power.</p>\n<p><strong>Uncommon:</strong> Mythic creatures and characters are uncommon in this scale of game, but not wholly resigned to the whispers of legend. The PCs also get mythic power, but their advancement in tier is slow. The GM can control this by limiting the number of trials that are presented. Likewise, mythic foes are still not pervasive, but are found with some regularity - leading secret cabals, harassing quiet villages on the edge of civilization, and dwelling in the dark places of the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Common:</strong> In the common scale, mythic characters and monsters are an everyday part of life. This doesn't mean that every town has a group of mythic heroes defending it, but that such characters are known to exist and their deeds are common knowledge. Nobles, priests, and other powerful people call upon the PCs for help against those dangerous monsters and villains others are powerless to fight. In this type of campaign, the PCs begin play with mythic power and see it grow as they gain levels, roughly at the rate of one mythic tier per two character levels.</p>"}

A skilled fighter might impact the history of a region, but a mythic champion can change its fate, and his every move is chronicled and recorded. Because of this greater impact on the campaign world, creating a mythic character requires you to work with the GM to find your place in the story and determine the source of your power.</p>\n<p>To create a mythic character, start by creating a normal character using the standard rules found in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. Despite their incredible abilities, mythic characters start with the same class features and abilities as normal ones.</p>\n<p>The process by which your character becomes mythic is determined by the shape of the overall campaign. Generally, characters become mythic in one of two ways - either the GM decides to make the characters mythic as one part of the campaign, or their ascension and subsequent deeds are the central focus of the story from nearly the very beginning. Whichever path is chosen influences how you create your mythic character.</p>\n<p>If mythic power is added to your character as part of a larger campaign (possibly only for a short period of time), that story defines the source of your newfound power, which is likely the same for all of the PCs. While you might not make all of the decisions about that power's origins and nature, you will still be able to customize your character by selecting your mythic path and abilities.</p>\n<p>If mythic power will instead be a central theme of the entire campaign, each PC might have a different, individual source of power. In such a campaign, you should work with your GM to determine the source of your mythic power. This could be anything from contact with an ancient artifact to gaining the sponsorship of a deity. The GM might ask for all of the PCs to share some aspects of their power - such as its source - to give them a common bond, or you might come together as part of a larger destiny, a gathering of great heroes to accomplish truly legendary deeds.</p>\n<p>In either case, there will be a moment in the campaign when you gain mythic power (or when it manifests, in the case of mythic power that has been latent in you since birth). This critical part of the story is called the moment of ascension. Depending on the style of the campaign, this could occur very early in the story or much later in your character's career, as part of larger plotline. From this moment onward, your character is mythic, and gains a mythic path and a variety of mythic abilities.</p>"}

The actual means by which the PCs receive this power may vary (see Mythic Themes on page 123), even between PCs in the same game. By the end of this part of the story, the PCs have had their moment of ascension (page 10), whether together or separately, and are now mythic. They are not yet ready to face their primary challenge, but the first steps down the path to victory should be revealed at this point.</p>\n<p>Often, the source of this power gives them a clue to their journey. For example, the tarrasque is tearing through the countryside, devouring entire towns. The PCs are forced to flee into a secluded valley near where the beast was slumbering, only to find that the valley contains an ancient seal recently broken. A guardian spirit explains to them that it has failed in its duty to keep the beast contained, and beseeches the PCs to intervene if they are brave enough. Giving the last of its strength, the spirit imbues the PCs with mythic power. As the spirit fades away, it tells them to seek out a legendary blade capable of ending the tarrasque.</p>\n<p>After receiving aid, the PCs are ready to begin their journey, but first they must leave their old world behind. Make this a painful choice for them, as the PCs must leave loved ones and comfort to venture into the unknown and ready themselves against true danger. This is a good time to present their first major challenge, so they can fully grasp the power they now command. The GM should also mark this point with some sort of loss or setback, to emphasize the gravity of the situation and the need for the PCs to undertake their quest. In the example above, the PCs might leave the valley only to find that their hometown is completely gone, devoured by the tarrasque. Before the PCs have a chance to mourn, they're beset by a group of cultists who helped to weaken the seal. After a deadly fight, the PCs see that they must leave to retrieve the blade if they're going to save other towns from this horrible fate.</p>"}

With the heroes possessing extraordinary power, the villains that defy them should also possess a measure of that power. A memorable, iconic villain will bump elbows with the PCs over and over again. Such a villain builds tension - for even as the PCs foil her plans, they're kept frustrated by failing to permanently stop this fiend. Creating such nasty villains is challenging as heroes grow stronger and get better at killing off persistent foes. To ensure the mythic villain survives, make use of noncombat encounters, ensure your villain always has an escape plan, and don't be afraid to reintroduce her after the players think she's had been finished off.</p>\n<p>Noncombat encounters help players develop a connection between their PCs and the villain in a way that doesn't risk the villain's life (or the PCs'). Early on, she can appear as a harmless or even helpful Npc. Or, if the PCs have already fought the villain, she can leave notes or use magic to taunt them. Various mythic powers, the Disguise skill, or even simple magic like disguise self, glibness, or nondetection can be used to help a villain blend in and rub elbows with the heroes all while seeming innocuous. Later, once the villain is revealed, she can work behind the scenes, using minions and other allies to accomplish her ends, all the while making it plain to the PCs that she's continuing to thwart them.</p>\n<p>In a world where powerful creatures are hunting you, paranoia and the willingness to abandon plans and allies are key to survival. If you want your villain to fight the players, plan an early exit. It's okay for a villain to flee even if she might win a confrontation, as her plans are a long game and require that she survive to see them through. There are many spells, mythic powers, and class abilities that give the villain the ability to get away in a hurry. She should use more mundane escape methods when possible, concealing her iconic escapes as much as possible so they're more difficult for the PCs to counter.</p>\n<p>Should the villain be killed, don't be afraid to have her revisit your campaign for a little posthumous mockery and mayhem. There are many ways to reintroduce a dead villain - sometimes it's as simple as having a minion cast raise dead or resurrection, but there are other, more sophisticated options. You can introduce a new recurring villain who tracks down one of the PCs' dead foes and brings him to some semblance of life in the form of an undead minion or possessed item, or who uses speak with dead to learn the deceased foe's secrets.</p>"}

You can cause the altered energy to either affect the opposite kind of targets (undead or living), or change whether it heals or harms, but not both. Channeled energy that has been changed in this way heals or deals half the normal amount of damage. For example, if an evil cleric attempts to channel negative energy to heal undead, you can expend one use of mythic power to convert that to channeled positive energy that either heals the living or harms undead. You must have the channel energy ability to select this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Bleed Holy Power (Su):</strong> If you channel positive energy, when an undead creature damages you with a melee attack, you can expend one use of channeled energy as an immediate action to channel energy to deal damage to undead creatures around you (as detailed in the channel energy ability). Alternatively, you may focus this channeled energy so it affects only the undead creature that hit you. If you focus solely on that creature, you are considered 4 levels higher in the class that grants you the channel energy feature when determining its effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Channel Shockwave (Su):</strong> You can expend one use of channel energy whenever you score a critical hit against a creature that has an element of alignment opposite to your own (chaotic and lawful are opposite, as are evil and good, so if you were lawful good, you could use this ability against a chaotic creature or evil creature). If you do, add your channel energy damage to the damage from the critical hit. This damage is the same type as your channeled energy (positive or negative) but damages the target regardless of whether it's living or undead. The target can attempt a Will save against your channel energy DC to halve this bonus damage. All other effects of your critical hit still apply.</p>\n<p><strong>Contingent Channel Energy (Su):</strong> You can simultaneously expend one use of mythic power and one use of your channel energy ability to delay your channel energy so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate. The conditions needed to bring the channel energy into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the channel effect occurs instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. For example, you could create a trigger that uses your channel positive energy if you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. If you prescribe complicated or convoluted conditions, your contingent channel energy ability could fail to trigger. The ability triggers based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to. You make all decisions about the ability when you expend the use of mythic power, according to what you can normally do with your channel energy ability; if you wish to exclude targets, you must name them at that time. You can have only one use of this ability waiting to be triggered at a time; if you use this ability again, the previous use expires. This use also expires after 1 day per tier if it hasn't been triggered. This use of channel energy can't be regained until after the contingent channel energy ability is triggered or expires.</p>\n<p><strong>Divine Countenance (Su):</strong> Whenever you encounter a creature whose alignment is within one step of yours, treat its attitude as one step better. If the creature's starting attitude is helpful, you can make requests of the creature with a +5 bonus on your Diplomacy or Intimidate skill check.</p>\n<p><strong>Divine Guardian (Sp):</strong> As a full-round action, you can expend one use of mythic power to summon one extraplanar creature as if using a summon monster or summon nature's ally spell, with the level of the summoning spell equal to half your tier. Your caster level for this ability is equal to your character level. You can have only one creature that has been summoned using this ability at a time; summoning another causes the previous one to disappear. If you expend two uses of mythic power, the level of the summoning spell is equal to your tier instead. For example, if you are a 10th-level druid, 5th-tier hierophant, you can use this ability to summon one creature from the summon monster II or summon nature's ally II list (or a lower-level list) for 10 rounds; if you expend two uses, you can instead summon one creature from the summon monster V or summon nature's ally V list (or a lower-level list).</p>\n<p><strong>Eldritch Breach (Su):</strong> You are adept at breaching magical defenses and resistance to your magic. When attempting a caster level check to dispel an effect, overcome spell resistance, or otherwise determine whether or not your magic affects a target (such as with knock or neutralize poison), roll twice and take the higher result.</p>\n<p><strong>Empathic Healing (Su):</strong> You can expend one use of mythic power to transfer up to 10 points of damage per tier from a touched ally to yourself, healing the target and damaging you. This transferred damage bypasses all effects that reduce or negate hit point damage (such as damage reduction). Alternatively, you can expend two uses of mythic power to transfer an ongoing disease or poison from a touched ally to yourself, which halts ongoing effects on the target from that affliction and requires you to attempt any remaining saves against it. If you're immune to the disease or poison, transferring it to yourself destroys the affliction.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhance Magic Items (Ex):</strong> Your mythic presence enhances the power of certain magic items. Add half your tier to the caster level of potions, scrolls, staves, and wands you use. When using a staff or wand, you may activate the item by expending one use of mythic power instead of one of the item's charges.</p>\n<p><strong>Faith's Reach (Su):</strong> Whenever you cast a divine spell with a range of touch, you can instead cast the spell with a range of 30 feet. If the spell normally requires a melee touch attack, it instead requires a ranged touch attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Flexible Counterspell (Su):</strong> Your mythic power enhances your ability to counter spells. As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to attempt to counter a spell. Upon using this ability, you must identify the spell with a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + the spell's level). If you correctly identify the spell, you can expend a spell or spell slot of a level equal to or higher than the spell being cast to counter the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Heathen Slayer (Ex):</strong> Pick one deity (or similar entity able to grant divine spells to followers) as your religious rival. You gain a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against this deity's followers, as well as a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against this deity's followers. At 6th tier, these bonuses increase to +4. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you do, choose an additional deity to be a religious rival.</p>\n<p><strong>Instrument of Faith (Su):</strong> You gain DR 15/ - against attacks made with your deity's favored weapon. You can expend one use of mythic power as a standard action to attempt a disarm or sunder combat maneuver check against each opponent within 60 feet that is wielding your deity's favored weapon. You decide individually whether to disarm or sunder each opponent's weapon. Attempt one combat maneuver check, using your caster level in place of your base attack bonus and adding your tier to the total, and use that result against all opponents.</p>\n<p><strong>Inverted Spontaneous Casting (Su):</strong> If you can spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells, you gain the ability to spontaneously cast the opposite type of spell (i.e., you can spontaneously cast inflict spells if you can normally cast cure spells, or cures spell if you can normally cast inflict spells). When spontaneously casting the opposite type of spell, you must use a spell slot that is at least 1 level higher than that of the spell you want to cast. For example, if you can spontaneously cast cure spells and want to spontaneously cast inflict light wounds, you must expend a 2nd-level spell slot.</p>\n<p><strong>Mighty Summons (Su):</strong> Each creature you conjure with any summon spell gains DR 5/epic for the duration of the summoning. If you cast a summon spell to summon more than one creature, you summon one additional creature of the same type. If you cast a summon spell to summon just one creature, you can expend one use of mythic power to give it the agile or savage mythic simple template (see page 224) for the duration of the summoning.</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Companion (Su):</strong> Select one animal companion, cohort, eidolon, familiar, or bonded mount. That creature can use the surge ability a number of times per day equal to your tier. Its surge ability uses the same bonus die type as you do when you use your surge ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Domain (Su):</strong> When determining the effects of your domain's granted powers, you're considered 4 levels higher. This increases the effects of powers you have access to, but doesn't grant you powers at a lower level than normal. Once per day, you can expend one use of mythic power as a standard action to regain the use of all your domain granted powers as if you had rested for 8 hours. If you're an oracle, all aspects of this ability apply to your revelations instead of to domain granted powers. You must have the domain class feature or mystery class feature to select this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Wild Shape (Su):</strong> Choose one form you can take using wild shape. Using wild shape to take this form doesn't count against your daily uses of wild shape. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, choose another form to not count against your daily uses of wild shape. You must have the wild shape class feature to select this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Overflowing Grace (Su):</strong> When you heal a creature with positive energy (such as by channeling positive energy to heal the living, using cure spells, or using lay on hands), any affected creature at full hit points (whether already at full hit points or healed to full hit points by your channeled energy) gains a +1 sacred bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws for 1 minute. If you channel negative energy to heal undead, this is a profane bonus rather than a sacred bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Pack Wild Shape (Su):</strong> Whenever you use the wild shape class feature, you can also transform allies when you change shape. When you use wild shape, you can expend one use of mythic power to select a number of willing allies equal to your tier. These allies take the same animal form as you do, with the same abilities as yours. Divide the duration of that use of wild shape evenly (rounded down) among yourself and the affected allies. The transformation ends for everyone when you return to your normal form or use wild shape again. An ally can end its own transformation early as a standard action without affecting the duration for you or other allies. You must have the wild shape class feature to select this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Plantbringer (Su):</strong> All plants within a 1-mile radius of you grow at double their normal rate and don't suffer from any diseases or maladies. Furthermore, allied plant creatures within 30 feet of you gain fast healing equal to your tier. If you use plant shape or wild shape to take the form of a plant, you gain this fast healing in plant form.</p>\n<p><strong>Relentless Healing (Su):</strong> You can restore life to the recently dead. If a creature has died within 1 round, as a free action you can expend one use of mythic power to apply healing magic to that creature. This healing can be from a spell or effect you cause or from a magic item you wield. If this healing brings the creature's hit points above the threshold for death, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total (similar to the way breath of life functions); otherwise, it remains dead. Alternatively, you can expend two uses of mythic power on a dead creature that would have the ability to magically heal itself if it were alive (such as a dead cleric with a prepared cure light wounds spell) in order to trigger the most powerful healing magic it knows or has prepared. If this brings the creature's hit points above its death threshold, it returns to life.</p>\n<p><strong>Sustained by Faith (Su):</strong> You require no food, water, or sleep. If you have abilities or class features that require rest before they can be regained, you can choose to regain them once per day by spending 1 hour in uninterrupted meditation. If you are 3rd tier or higher, you can expend one use of mythic power in order to also not need to breathe for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Symbol of the Holy (Su):</strong> As a standard action, you can create a wooden holy symbol dedicated to your deity. If it ever leaves your possession, it fades away after 1 hour. Whenever you use this holy symbol as a divine focus when casting a spell, you don't need to have any other material component, unless that component costs more than 50 gp per tier you possess.</p>\n<p><strong>Tongue of the Land (Su):</strong> Animals, elementals, fey, and plants are magically able to understand you when you speak Druidic, as if you were using speak with animals or tongues. If speaking to creatures of different types at the same time, you can allow all of them to understand you or speak understandably to just one type at a time. For example, if speaking to a group of animals and fey, you can make yourself understandable to all of them, just to the animals, or just to the fey.</p>\n<p><strong>Water of Life (Su):</strong> Any potions you consume have the maximum effect, as if they were created using the Maximize Spell feat. You can quickly create a temporary potion by casting a spell into a pint of water. The spell must be a valid choice for the Brew Potion feat and have a spell level no higher than your tier. The targeted liquid becomes a potion of that spell. If not consumed, the temporary potion reverts to normal water after 1 hour per tier.</p>\n<p>Special Abilities</p>"}

It's tempting for many GMs to make that a part of a mythic campaign. While you can certainly use such a plot device in your game, the loss of power must be handled carefully to avoid turning an otherwise fun string of adventures into something no one wants to play anymore. Here are a few tips to make this idea work in a fun way.</p>\n<p>To start with, this is only a good option when the characters are in the middle tiers (between 4th and 7th tier). If the heroes are of a lower tier, they haven't used their mythic power enough to make the powerlessness storyline interesting. If they're of a higher tier, the gulf between their mythic story and the story being told now is so great that it may break the flow of the story.</p>\n<p>Powerlessness arcs should last no more than a couple sessions, lest the temporary loss of power start to seem like a permanent disability.</p>\n<p>Causes of the PCs' powerlessness need to be explainable - and either the characters know about it beforehand or someone informs them of the cause after they've lost their powers. It could be an event that comes to pass, like a lunar eclipse or a great volcano's eruption disrupting the flow of power in the world. Or a foe might enact a ritual to nullify the heroes' power. The PCs might even be responsible for their own loss of power, especially if the divine being who granted the powers doesn't approve of their recent activities.</p>\n<p>Solutions to the PCs' plight should make sense from a story perspective. Events pass, reinstating the PCs' mythic power (in which case, the PCs need merely to wait, and possibly fight to survive until then). The foe's rituals are undone by the temporarily normal PCs. Or penance can be granted as the PCs show that they're still worthy.</p>\n<p>Drama happens between the cause and solution: foes that should have been easy before become challenges again, and those the heroes have angered can now retaliate, whether they are monstrous foes or slighted townsfolk. The rewards acquired during this time should reflect the difficulty of the challenges the PCs face.</p>"}

Any attack that is not an attempt to sever a head affects the body, including area attacks or attacks that cause piercing or bludgeoning damage.

A mythic hydra can't have more than twice its original number of heads at any one time. To prevent new heads from growing, at least 5 points of acid or fire damage must be dealt to the stump (a touch attack to hit) before they appear. Acid or fire damage from area attacks can affect stumps and the body simultaneously. A hydra doesn't die from losing heads until all its heads are cut off and the stumps are seared by acid or fire.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>A mythic hydra is a deadly combination of bites, lunges, speed, and durability.

What Makes Mythic Adventures Different?","permission":{"default":0,"xdjh9CzHvgUgsBmZ":3},"folder":"","flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_vsoz9egk3n","path":"Pathfinder Mythic Adventures Reference Library#/CP_SEP/Introduction","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<p>In a world of might and sorcery, with dragons and elves, what does it mean to be \"mythic?\" Being mythic means possessing a degree of might unusual even in a fantasy world. Scenes turn more dramatic, the enemies are more lethal, and the consequences of the heroes' actions make a far-ranging impact. Being mythic means invoking a sense of wonder and awe even in those already accustomed to the strange and unusual.</p>\n<p>The way this book portrays the mythic narrative isn't solely about stories at 20th level and monsters with high Challenge Ratings - it's about the surprising and unfamiliar regardless of power and scale. Even 1st-level characters could be imbued with mythic power and become forces to be reckoned with. Similarly, lesser monsters such as ogres and skeletons that become mythic transform into terrifying foes with unknown powers, changing the nature of the story you're playing - and startling those accustomed to their non-mythic ilk.</p>\n<p>Not only the characters take on unexpected forms in mythic adventures; the setting does as well. The vistas are more dramatic, featuring flying islands and keeps that float in raging volcanoes. The colors are brighter, the sounds are more mysterious, and all of the other stimuli are sharper and more vibrant. Where the non-mythic hero would encounter a crumbling keep filled with familiar monsters, a mythic hero faces a towering citadel that builds itself from the bones of would-be invaders and is inhabited by cruel and malign creatures of nearly god-like power.</p>\n<p>Besides the setting, the challenges that face mythic characters are far more harrowing than usual. Enhanced abilities allow mythic characters to take on threats beyond the reach of those without such power. They can face with ease foes both powerful and numerous. The real challenge is when they take on mythic creatures that possess the same resilient nature and abilities similar in potency to those they themselves rely on. When a mythic hero comes face to face with a mythic monster, the battle is truly legendary.</p>\n<p>Finally, mythic adventures feature difficult choices and far-reaching consequences. As the characters progress through the story, they're tasked with taking on challenges that seem impossible even to them, and might be tempted to wander from their path. As mythic heroes, they're the first to respond to cataclysmic events, just as they're the last bastion to stem the tide of evil and darkness that threatens to wash over the world. Their successes and failures leave marks on the world for centuries to come.</p>"}

In this theme, mythic power is the provenance of the gods and only divine agents may wield such power.</p>\n<p><strong>Scope:</strong> Since the heroes' mythic powers come from a specific deity, their activities may occur in places where the deity is popularly worshiped or challenged. The heroes could function as champions of the deity, protecting lands their god has deemed only for the righteous. They could also be emissaries, traveling to distant lands where their god is unknown. A campaign could even take place in lands where worship of the heroes' god is strictly outlawed by the ruling religion.</p>\n<p>In any case, the scope is somewhat defined by the gods' wishes, for what they give they can just as easily take away. (Or perhaps they can only bestow mythic powers, and are incapable of removing them, making ascending mortals a risky proposition.)</p>\n<p><strong>Ascension:</strong> The PCs are actually children of a god, the result of a pairing with a mortal. This is unknown to them until the appointed hour, when their divine heritage manifests. Using this hook, it's possible that all of the PCs are related, even if they don't realize it at first (each having been raised by a mortal surrogate parent).</p>\n<p>During a vicious battle at an especially holy site, one of the heroes is slain. As her companions use resurrection magic to bring her back from the dead, the spell expands in a glowing aura that imbues all the heroes, including the newly risen one, with mythic powers.</p>\n<p>The heroes fight bravely to defend or restore a site of worship. When the last enemy is slain and the site is reconsecrated, the heroes are filled with a sense of divine gratitude and blessed with mythic powers.</p>\n<p><strong>Story:</strong> In this theme, the gods take a much more active role in the world. They may be only able to act indirectly, and need heroes like the PCs to carry out their will. Or there are too many threats for even the gods to face, so they need champions to fight on other fronts.</p>\n<p>A party with several members dedicated to the same god lends itself naturally to such a story. These heroes receive occasional divine communications from their patron through dreams, omens, or visitations. While they may go on adventures unrelated to their deity, the overall arc of the campaign is guided by their faith and culminates in a battle against an enemy of their patron.</p>\n<p>In a party of mixed faiths, the story could center on discovering the identity of the mysterious benefactor who gifted the PCs with mythic powers. Dreams and omens could still trigger adventures, but these are muddled and cloudy. In the end, the heroes could find their power came from one particular patron, or from an alliance of deities who have joined together against a particularly formidable villain.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Rival gods can imbue their own champions with power, or create mythic monsters to oppose the heroes. While not every adventure needs to contain a mythic challenge, the major villains and ultimate challenge should be mythic in nature and diametrically opposed to the PCs' patrons.</p>\n<p><strong>Ending:</strong> The final stage of the journey for the heroes should center on the goals of their patron deity. A rival deity almost always opposes the goals, and will stop at nothing to see the PCs fail. The PCs might have to face off against a powerful agent of that rival or maybe even against some sort of avatar of the divine being itself. At the loftiest heights of power, the PCs might be tasked with going to the rivals' home realm and fighting the angry god directly. They might not survive such an encounter, but with the backing of their patron, they might still accomplish their goal - and their heroism may become a religious story to be told down through the ages.</p>"}

Unlike a normal staff, a staff of eldritch sovereignty holds 50 charges and can't be recharged normally. Some of its powers use charges, and others don't. A staff of eldritch sovereignty doesn't lose its powers if it runs out of charges. The following powers don't use charges:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arcane lock</li>\n<li>Arcane sight</li>\n<li>Daylight</li>\n<li>Knock</li>\n<li>Mage armor</li>\n<li>Mage hand</li>\n<li>Touch of idiocy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following powers drain 1 charge per use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Black tentacles</li>\n<li>Cone of cold (15d6 damage, Reflex DC 20 half)</li>\n<li>Fireball (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 18 half)</li>\n<li>Greater dispel magic</li>\n<li>Greater invisibility</li>\n<li>Greater teleport</li>\n<li>Lightning arc [UM] (15d6 damage, Reflex DC 20 half)</li>\n<li>Major image (Will DC 18 disbelief)</li>\n<li>Suggestion (Will DC 18 negates)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These powers drain 2 charges per use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Summon monster IX (the summoned creatures receive the benefits of the Augment Summoning feat)</li>\n<li>Plane shift (Will DC 22 negates, arrive 2 to 200 miles from the intended destination)</li>\n<li>Prismatic sphere (DC 24)</li>\n<li>Prismatic spray (DC 22)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For 5 charges, the staff of arcane sovereignty creates a gate.</p>\n<p>The staff of eldritch sovereignty has higher DCs than normal for a staff. The wielder still uses her own save DCs if they exceed those of the staff.</p>\n<p>The wielder can use any of her metamagic feats on spells cast with the staff of eldritch sovereignty by expending 1 charge per increase in spell level, with a minimum of 1 charge spent. The adjusted level of the spell can't be increased above 9th level. For example, a user with Quicken Spell can spend 5 charges to cast a quickened cone of cold with the staff, but couldn't use it to cast quickened greater teleport.</p>\n<p>The wielder can expend one use of mythic power to gain the benefit of a number of charges equal to her mythic tier. Any excess charges are lost. For example, a 5th-tier wielder with Empower Spell could expend one use of mythic power to cast an empowered fireball without consuming any charges from the staff. A wielder who knows the mythic version of one of the staff's spells can cast such spells from the staff by expending one use of mythic power. This can be combined with using mythic power to provide charges. Finally, the wielder can expend one use of mythic power to add 1 charge to the staff, with no risk of explosion if the staff is already fully charged.</p>\n<p>A staff of eldritch sovereignty gives the wielder spell resistance equal to 23 plus her tier. If this is willingly lowered, however, the staff can be used to absorb arcane energy directed at its wielder, as a rod of absorption does. Unlike the rod, this staff converts spell levels into charges rather than retaining them as spell energy usable by a spellcaster. If the staff absorbs enough energy to exceed its limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if the wielder had performed a retributive strike (see Destruction). The wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at her - the staff doesn't communicate this knowledge as a rod of absorption does. Thus, absorbing spells can be risky.</p>\n<h1>Destruction</h1>\n<p>A staff of eldritch sovereignty can be broken for a retributive strike. Such an act must be purposeful and declared by the wielder. All charges in the staff are released in a 30-foot-radius spread. Quadruple the wielder's tier and add this amount to the number of charges remaining in the staff. All creatures within 10 feet of the staff take an amount of damage equal to 10 times this number. A successful Reflex save with a DC equal to 23 plus the wielder's tier halves the damage.</p>\n<p>Unlike with the staff of the magi, breaking a staff of arcane sovereignty invariably destroys the wielder (no saving throw).</p>"}

And of the young elf who spends years studying musty tomes and practicing simple spells before she heads out into the world to seek ancient lore. These are the stories of everyday adventurers, risen from the ranks of the common folk to make a name for themselves in places harsh and unforgiving.</p>\n<p>But these are not the only stories of heroism. Some adventurers are beyond exemplary - their stories forge the greatest sagas of history, and their every deed births a legend. From the children of gods, blessed with the divine spark, to the lucky heroes born under auspicious stars, these characters are destined to greatness. They are mythic: possessed of unparalleled heroism and capable of astounding acts.</p>\n<p>To be mythic means to draw upon a power that few even dare to understand, and even fewer hope to wield. An air of destiny surrounds mythic characters, and each choice they make shapes the world at large. Their story is intertwined with the great events of the day, and their actions are central to the outcomes. Mythic characters are more resilient and powerful than others, and as a result are awe-inspiring in ways their non-mythic counterparts could never match. Other adventurers might balk at taking on a dragon that plagues a village, but mythic heroes would not only take on the dragon, but also clear the entire region of threats.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the story of mythic heroes is defined by the challenges they face. The GM has a number of new and awe-inspiring tools with which to confront mythic player characters, ranging from immense and deadly mythic monsters to vile and cunning mythic villains. Mythic monsters are unique creatures or remnants of a bygone age when such terrifying beasts ruled over the land. They now dwell in the lost places of the world, waiting for their time to bring great terror. Mythic villains have many of the powers of mythic characters, but they use their abilities selfishly - to subjugate kingdoms, slaughter the innocent, and bring ruin to the world. Unless heroes rise to stop them, mythic villains can cause destruction and chaos on an unimaginable scale.</p>\n<p>Even with such great power, mythic characters are not invulnerable, just more able to deal with the dangers of the world around them. If a mythic character dies, her loss is a great tragedy to the world, as the light of one of its true champions has been extinguished. This is what makes a mythic story exciting: these heroes might fall, just as non-mythic heroes might succumb to lesser threats. And when they do succeed, their victory often comes at a high cost, and usually leaves them scarred.</p>\n<p>The rules in this book give players and GMs the tools they need to run mythic adventures. The mythic rules add to the base rules of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, either as part of an adventure in which the PCs attain mythic power for a limited time, or as the backbone of an entire campaign charting the legend of a group of mythic characters. Some of the rules in this book draw upon the Advanced Player's Guide, the Advanced Race Guide, Ultimate Combat, Ultimate Equipment, and Ultimate Magic - but these books are not required to add mythic aspects to your game.</p>"}

The following structure is a guide to help GMs in planning out their mythic experience, regardless of length. This formula can work for a single session, where the PCs gain mythic power at the beginning and lose it by the end. Or you can apply it to an entire campaign, where the PCs gain mythic power early on and retire after of dozens of adventures.</p>\n<p>Many mythic stories follow a common narrative structure (see The Monomyth sidebar on page 123). This structure is divided into five parts: the contact, the awakening, the journey, the return, and the life after. In the contact, the PCs encounter a threat too great for them to handle. In the awakening, they're granted mythic power to handle this threat. In the journey, the heroes quest to increase that power and gain what they need to vanquish that threat. In the return, they finally encounter the threats as equals (or near-equals) and have the opportunity to forever right the world. In the life after, the mythic heroes deal with the aftermath of their trials, and either become normal characters once again or hold onto their new power.</p>\n<p>This structure isn't set in stone.

Some take a more humble route, watching over those dear to them or the lands they call home. Guardians seek connections with those around them, even the beasts, and draw their power from the trust of such bonds. This doesn't mean that all guardians are peaceful - indeed many use violent means to further their goals and safeguard those they watch over. But they find worth in those who travel with them. In battle, none can take the sort of punishment and wounds that a guardian can sustain.</p>\n<p><strong>Role:</strong> When others would retreat, you stand your ground. Your place is at the front of the battle, taking every hit your enemies can give while daring them to dish out more. Your job is to stop your enemies' advance, interposing yourself in the path of peril. You'll gladly take all that brutal punishment and return the beating with zeal. The wounds you suffer might kill a lesser hero, but you relish the thrill of combat, confident that your physical and mental perfection will lead to victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Classes:</strong> Any class that is frequently in the middle of a chaotic melee will find many valuable abilities within the guardian path. Barbarians, cavaliers, fighters, inquisitors, monks, and paladins all make excellent guardians. Some of the guardian's powers also lend themselves to the druid, ranger, or even the summoner, granting bonuses to companions and allies.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus Hit Points:</strong> Whenever you gain a guardian tier, you gain 5 bonus hit points.

All legendary items have the following abilities, which don't count against the maximum number of legendary abilities an item can have or the maximum number of abilities the item's bearer can use.</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Bond:</strong> A legendary item is typically bonded to a single mythic creature. Others can pick up and use a legendary item for its basic functions (like hitting a foe with a legendary mace), but only the creature bonded to the item can utilize it fully.</p>\n<p>A mythic creature can be bonded to only one legendary item at a time. If a mythic creature is already bonded to a legendary item, she can't become bonded to another item until the previous bond is broken. Likewise, a legendary item that is already bonded to a mythic creature can't be bonded to another until the former bond is broken.</p>\n<p>Creatures that aren't bonded to the legendary item can typically use all of its special abilities that aren't legendary item abilities. Such creatures can also use the item's legendary surge base legendary ability, but only by using the item's reservoir of legendary power. They can't use any other legendary item abilities requiring an expenditure of legendary power, though some legendary item abilities (such as intelligence) are persistent abilities, which means they continue to function whether the user is bonded to the item or not.</p>\n<p>A mythic creature bonded to a legendary item can use a number of that item's legendary abilities equal to or less than her tier. If the legendary item has more legendary abilities than the bonded creature has tiers, the creature can select which abilities it gains access to when it first wields, wears, or possesses the item, but must select all of the persistent abilities first, after which it can select non-persistent abilities. For example, if a legendary item has the intelligence ability along with other non-persistent abilities, a 1st-tier character can't manifest any of its powers other than intelligence until she gains another tier.</p>\n<p>If the bonded creature has taken the legendary item universal path ability a sufficient number of times, she can add legendary abilities to the item.</p>\n<p>Lastly, a bonded creature can expend uses of her mythic power to activate an item's legendary abilities that otherwise require uses of legendary power. One use of the creature's mythic power counts as one use of the item's legendary power.</p>\n<p>A mythic creature becomes bonded with an item either when she makes the item ascend using the legendary item universal path ability, or when she completes a trial while wielding, wearing, or carrying the item. The nature of the trial needed to bond with a legendary item and any other prerequisites for bonding are determined by the GM.</p>\n<p>The bond between a mythic creature and a legendary item can be broken in the following ways. If the bonded creature dies, the bond is broken. If that creature comes back to life, the bond is typically not reinstated unless the item has the eternal bond ability. The bonded creature can also relinquish the bond. Doing so requires a special ritual that takes 24 hours to perform, though the GM might add other requirements. If the bonded creature becomes non-mythic, the bond is broken. Lastly, the bond is broken if a legendary item gains the broken condition.</p>\n<p><strong>Legendary Power:</strong> All legendary items contain a pool of power - at least two uses that recharge each day. This power is called legendary power, and it works differently than mythic power. Any creature bearing the item can expend the items uses of legendary power, whether or not that creature is mythic. These uses of legendary power can be expended only to activate the legendary item's abilities. If the item's bearer isn't bonded to the item, she can expend the item's legendary power only to use its legendary surge ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Legendary Surge:</strong> All legendary items have a legendary surge ability, similar to a mythic character's surge ability (see page 170). It can be used only on specific rolls or checks based on the nature or purpose of the legendary item - see the Legendary Surge sidebar on page 170.</p>\n<p>The legendary surge ability allows the bearer to add the result of a d6 to the appropriate type of roll or check. A mythic bearer can use her surge die type in place of the d6. If she's bonded to the item, she can increase that die type by one step.</p>"}

Use these as is or as inspiration for designing your own. Some of these suggest a mythic origin as well, but can be reworked for other mythic characters. Note that some of these are larger in scope and might represent an entire campaign arc. At the GM's discretion, such longer events might represent several trials.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>A Noble's Mind Overthrown</h1>\n<p>A great king or emperor succumbs to a strange madness, either from some unforeseen disease or a villain's magical corruption. In the ensuing mania, the ruler declares war on followers of the major religions, hitherto great supporters of the crown and a boon to the common people. Not wanting to provoke outright war between the crown and the faiths, the mythic characters are charged by their patron to discover the cure for their monarch's besieged mind.</p>\n<h1>Abyssal Parasite</h1>\n<p>A powerful interaction of multiple mythic spells destroyed the body of a powerful demon, but in its place created a vengeful spirit neither dead nor alive. The spirit is capable of possessing others and infusing its host with demonic powers, using this as an opportunity to gather evil allies and gain strength. A celestial being that opposes demonkind calls the upon PCs to stop the vile being. They must then track the demon spirit as it moves from victim to victim, until the heroes can eradicate the demonic shade.</p>\n<h1>Aftermath</h1>\n<p>The kingdom has been ravaged by a terrible battle with an invading force. The king's armies suffered a pyrrhic victory - the realm is all but destroyed. The PCs must help restore the domain to its former glory by rooting out remaining enemies, tending to the suffering people, rebuilding the cities, striking deals with neighboring nations for aid, and protecting the kingdom against further attack by emboldened foes.</p>\n<h1>First Steps</h1>\n<p>The PCs are normal adventurers who come to the aid of a strange creature beset by vicious enemies. Unfortunately, by the time the PCs fend off the attackers, the gravely wounded creature is drawing its last breaths. Just before dying, it bestows mythic power upon the heroes and entrusts them with a quest that it was not able to complete. With their new abilities, the PCs can finish the mission, avenge their fallen benefactor, and take their first steps into a larger world of challenges and foes greater than they ever knew existed.</p>\n<h1>For Those Who Must Follow</h1>\n<p>The PCs are heroes in the days before a coming apocalypse at the hands of a dark divine or even extraterrestrial power. Unlike a campaign where the PCs must stop a cataclysm, in this trial they have no hope of averting the impending disaster. Instead, they must draw on mythic power to lay a foundation for future heroes to save the world. Their adventures will lead them to create secret repositories containing knowledge and small slivers of their own mythic power. While doing this they also attempt to form deep alliances with disparate groups the world over, laying the groundwork for the heroes that will one day rise and change the fate of a world that they themselves had not time enough to save.</p>\n<h1>Into the Abyss</h1>\n<p>The PCs go on a quest to the Abyss, and must endure a harrowing expedition through the infinite layers of that chaotic evil realm. They're tasked to rescue an important mortal sold into demonic slavery, retrieve a soul that was condemned to the Abyss by mistake, or topple a particularly destructive demon lord. Whatever the reason, the adventurers face challenges that push their new abilities to the limit.</p>\n<h1>Lost Souls</h1>\n<p>The souls of the dead are not reaching their final destinations, but are instead trapped in a state of waiting. The PCs must discover what is powerful enough to interfere with this cosmic process - and for what dark purpose. Worse, the denied souls are being twisted into monstrous forms, causing pockets of corruption and instability, and presenting other threats to the world. The PCs struggle to unravel the mystery and defeat the furtive villain behind it all.</p>\n<h1>Mirror Through The Multiverse</h1>\n<p>A sudden magical event, like an arcane earthquake, shreds the barrier between parallel worlds. The divine powers of each realm perceive the others as threats and seek to do away with the rival \"mockeries\" of their own world through their ascended champions. The PCs are selected on behalf of their world's pantheon of gods while searching out their opponents, some of whom might be eerily similar to them. GMs can offer players the choice of vanquishing their opponents or of allying with them in a joint effort to stop this cosmic bout.</p>\n<h1>Proving Grounds OF The Great Beyond</h1>\n<p>The PCs are captured and taken to a grand arena where they must fight against other legendary creatures for the amusement of powerful planar entities. Each round of the competition proves more deadly than the last, as it becomes clear that only one team will survive this tournament. If the PCs are victorious, a great boon might be bestowed upon them, so when the chance to escape presents itself, they must decide whether or not to continue.</p>\n<h1>Redemption</h1>\n<p>Pursuing a once-strong champion of goodness like a fallen angel or an antipaladin, the PCs use mythic power not to oppose their enemy but to discover the source of his defection in the hopes of turning him back to the light. Or they must cleanse a relic that's been polluted by some festering malignancy. The corruption is so deep-seated that the PCs must journey to a distant place of renown that can be reached only by heroes wielding the strongest of mythic powers.</p>\n<h1>Revenge Unyielding</h1>\n<p>Some legendary warrior or powerful monster returns, like a dragon or giant once imprisoned in stasis, petrified, or under an enchanted sleep. Finding its world gone and all of its family and kin perished at the hands of heroes long since past, its mind collapses into madness. The creature vows revenge on all its foes' descendants, or perhaps even the entire world, and slaughters in blind rage. The heroes must find a way to stay the avenger's madness or put the tormented soul to rest.</p>\n<h1>The Culling Plague</h1>\n<p>A rare disease has stricken one of the great races of the world. Giants, dragons, even outsiders might be victim to this debilitating plague. The oldest members of the afflicted species beseech the adventurers to stem this horrible contagion. Such a quest could take the PCs to far-flung parts of the world (and perhaps even beyond) searching for rare ingredients to concoct a cure. Alternatively, a sickness that strikes a species spread across the spectrum of good and evil, like outsiders or dragons, might make the PCs unlikely peace brokers between angels and devils or chromatic and metallic dragonkind while trying to find the cure.</p>\n<h1>The Giving Rain</h1>\n<p>The flensed flesh of a deity executed for unknowable crimes falls in a gory rain across the land. The areas with the highest concentration exhibit bizarre, troubling effects. The PCs, being close to one such place, gain mythic powers. Drawn to other epicenters as if pulled by the godflesh, the heroes must deal with the changes wrought by the storm. This includes putting down monsters that have likewise gained strange new abilities, hunting down masses of godflesh that are hidden deep underground or atop the highest peaks, and restoring peace to kingdoms that have gone to war over possession of these divine blessings.</p>\n<h1>The Old Guard</h1>\n<p>The PCs inherit a grand duty from a group of aging heroes with a sacred and momentous charge. This might be guarding a rift in the multiverse, manning the prison of a dreaded lich or even an elder god, or preserving the first teachings of arcane magic or a hallowed fighting style. The aging guardians deputize the PCs and charge them with a sacred quest to find others able to wield mythic power and take over for the august veterans when their time has come, or grant the PCs a chance to become the new guardians themselves. In the latter case, the older heroes direct the PCs toward quests and accomplishments that will increase their mythic power to the levels needed to replace the retiring guardians. Perhaps the PCs don't even realize they're being vetted for this crucial role as they undergo their adventures.</p>\n<h1>To Challenge A God</h1>\n<p>An evil deity and its minions are making a play for ultimate power in the mortal realms. Other gods, prevented from interfering in the matter by a divine compact, task the characters to oppose the usurper. The PCs must disrupt the schemes of the deity's minions and work their way up through the ranks, breaking the chain one link at a time, until they finally confront the ambitious god.</p>\n<h1>Uniting The Armies</h1>\n<p>War rages across the land. Disparate humanoid and monstrous races fight with one another, oblivious to a rising threat that will soon endanger them all - and that might have orchestrated their conflicts in the first place to keep their armies occupied. The heroes alone learn the truth and must use their mythic powers to unite the warring groups - but doing so means facing a series of challenges of diplomacy, intrigue, and brute force. Only by banding together will the land be able to fight off their immense foe in the ultimate battle.</p>"}

Where mythic characters differ is in the special abilities they gain from mythic paths - collections of similar abilities that they can choose to represent their mythic power.

Each chapter contains rules organized around one particular theme, such as players' mythic paths, feats, spells, or magic items. The first three chapters contain rules primarily for players creating mythic characters. The following four chapters provide Game Masters with all they need to plan and run mythic adventures and campaigns. Some of the rules in these chapters, in particular the magic items from Chapter 5, will be useful to players as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Chapter 1 - @Compendium[mythicadventures.mythicadventures.r6yH07oevpUX1kXG]{Mythic Heroes}:</strong> Your journey begins with these rules for creating a mythic character. This chapter includes rules for the six mythic paths characters can select from upon gaining mythic power. It starts with a discussion of mythic characters, including a number of common abilities shared by all mythic characters as they advance in tier. This section also describes how to select a mythic path for each character. Each path includes over 40 different abilities you can choose from when creating your character, as well as tips and advice for building heroes along different themes. You'll also find rules for advancing your mythic hero by accomplishing legendary trials, in parallel to advancement in your class. Here is what you can look forward to in each path.</p>\n<p><em>@Compendium[mythicadventures.mythicadventures.vKcoWoPrUgGnzzqT]{Archmage} </em>This master of the arcane uses mythic power to cast powerful spells, penetrating even the most stalwart of defenses. Though most of the archmage's powers involve spellcasting, some of her abilities grant greater knowledge of and insight into the world around her.</p>\n<p><em>@Compendium[mythicadventures.mythicadventures.YE7qN1uuwc5ZrWzW]{Champion} </em>No mythic hero is more skilled at martial combat than the champion. Few can survive the devastating strikes and skilled maneuvers of this master of melee. A champion also has access to a variety of abilities that allow her to stay in the fight.</p>\n<p><em>@Compendium[mythicadventures.mythicadventures.pJcbky7xB6aigfjK]{Guardian}</em>&nbsp;In a world with mythic heroes, there are many mythic foes that can deliver the same sorts of devastating hits and powerful spells. Fortunately, a guardian can take them all on and keep fighting. Capable of sustaining horrific wounds that would kill a lesser hero, the guardian is an unbreakable wall standing between fearsome foes and their would-be prey.</p>\n<p><em>@Compendium[mythicadventures.mythicadventures.5aKep4xdcNvvhx1H]{Hierophant}</em>&nbsp;As a direct conduit of divine magic, the hierophant has glimpsed great power and understands how to wield it. Drawing magic from a deity or the spirit of the natural world, the hierophant can cast incredibly powerful divine spells or channel his power to heal even the most grievous wounds.</p>\n<p><em>@Compendium[mythicadventures.mythicadventures.UrF2zotmujtoqzky]{Marshal}</em>&nbsp;Though no mythic hero is a follower, some were truly born to lead. The marshal uses mythic power to aid her allies in a variety of different ways - aiding their attacks, bolstering their defenses, and in some cases even taking wounds for them so they can keep on fighting.</p>\n<p><em>@Compendium[mythicadventures.mythicadventures.5Iwrpy8uzxxXtTkx]{Trickster}</em>&nbsp;Masters of deception and diplomacy, the trickster is a mystery to his allies and doom to his enemies. Whether striking from the shadows or manipulating events in the open, the trickster has a wide variety of abilities that allow him to accomplish his goals, even if those goals are as mysterious as he is.</p>\n<p>This chapter closes with a number of universal mythic path abilities that characters of any path will find useful.</p>\n<p><strong>Chapter 2 - @Compendium[mythicadventures.mythicadventures.Eln5sPwGqoqj2oic]{Mythic Feats}:</strong> This chapter includes a wide variety of mythic feats available to heroes as they gain tiers, much as characters receive non-mythic feats as they gain levels. Most of these feats are upgrades to existing feats, giving increased flexibility and heightened benefits to those who already possess the non-mythic versions. Other feats grant you additional power and opportunities not available to non-mythic characters. There are even some feats meant to be taken by non-mythic characters who come into contact with the mythic world.</p>\n<p><strong>Chapter 3 - @Compendium[mythicadventures.mythicadventures.bVWf5hnPbH4YW8Xs]{Mythic Spells}:</strong> This chapter takes a number of iconic and bizarre spells and gives them mythic upgrades, enhancing their might and what they can accomplish. Through various path abilities or the Mythic Spells feat, mythic characters can learn the mythic versions of spells, allowing them to infuse their casting with mythic power for greater effects any time they cast the spells. Some spells even have augmented versions that can be unlocked only by a character of sufficient tier, granting truly powerful and world-shaping effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Chapter 4 - @Compendium[mythicadventures.mythicadventures.tO7rJ2CapxmsdvaJ]{Running A Mythic Game}:</strong> Creating a mythic story, whether it lasts for a single session or an entire campaign, requires more planning than your typical game. Mythic stories should evoke a greater sense of danger and wonder. This chapter provides a wealth of advice and rules toward that end - to aid you in creating a story that your players will never forget, with challenging foes and incredible vistas. Also included are guidelines for pacing the advancement of mythic characters, giving out suitable rewards, and creating villains that can challenge mythic heroes. At the end of this chapter, you will also find a number of sample adventure ideas, ready to be used in your game.</p>\n<p><strong>Chapter 5 - @Compendium[mythicadventures.mythicadventures.to8Y2ntn0mtdo6gK]{Mythic Magic Items}:</strong> Mythic heroes can acquire magic items that, when activated with mythic power, can be used in new and astonishing ways. This chapter includes a wide variety of new magic items, from magic weapons and armors to potent cloaks, rings, and other objects of incredible power. It also describes a number of minor and major artifacts, because such items frequently play crucial, important roles in mythic tales. Finally, you'll find rules for creating legendary magic items that increase in power along with the characters who wield them.</p>\n<p><strong>Chapter 6 - @Compendium[mythicadventures.mythicadventures.Tjftin64P9yd1orw]{Mythic Monsters}:</strong> With all of the power and abilities granted to mythic heroes, they need monsters that will challenge them and push them to the breaking point. This chapter includes over 40 mythic versions of classic monsters, such as dragons, the medusa, and the vampire. Also included are rules for creating entirely new mythic monsters, guidelines for monsters up to CR 30, and quick mythic templates for upgrading existing monsters to give them a mythic edge.</p>\n<p><strong>[Not Included] Chapter 7 - Fire Over Blackcrag:</strong> This short adventure gives a quick introduction to mythic adventuring. The player characters are visiting the seaside town of Blackcrag Cove when a nearby volcano threatens to engulf the town in flames. After a difficult journey to find answers about the impending catastrophe, the characters become imbued with mythic power, and are empowered to face the enormous challenges ahead. The heroes must leave the normal world behind and travel to a faraway, fantastical island if they're to save the town from certain devastation in time.</p>"}

This maximum increases to six if the bonded creature selects the legendary item universal path ability twice, and then to 10 if the bonded creature selects the ability three times (again, the maximum cannot exceed the bonded creature's number of tiers). These abilities are added at the rate of one per day. Once selected, these abilities cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>If a mythic creature bonds to an existing legendary item, it can use a number of the item's existing abilities equal to its tier, but cannot add abilities unless it possesses the legendary item universal path ability (subject to the limitations of that ability).</p>\n<p>The following legendary abilities can be added to a legendary item.</p>\n<p><strong>Adroit:</strong> Choose a single skill that can be augmented by the item's legendary surge. As a swift action, the item's bonded creature can expend one use of legendary power to gain a +20 insight bonus on the next check she attempts with that skill before the end of her turn. The item must have a legendary surge that augments skill checks to have this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Dedicated Bond:</strong> An item with this ability can't be used by anyone not bonded with it. Such creatures can't use the item's non-mythic special abilities, its legendary power, or its legendary surge. Furthermore, using a special ritual that takes 10 minutes to perform, the bonded creature can sequester the item in a solid object at least twice as large as the item (such as putting a sword in a stone or an oak tree). The item becomes impossible to remove by any creature not bonded to it unless by means of a wish or miracle cast by a mythic creature of higher tier than the bonded creature. If the bonded creature is at least 8th tier, she can instead perform this sequestering ritual and transfer the bond to another mythic creature she designates upon completing the ritual.</p>\n<p>An item must be a minor or major artifact to have this ability. This is a persistent ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Eternal Bond:</strong> When this ability is taken, the item becomes intimately tied to the creature that gave it this ability. This item can't be bonded to another creature as long as the creature that gave it this ability is alive and mythic. If the creature that gave it this ability dies or becomes non-mythic, this item can be bonded to another creature, but that creature doesn't gain the benefit of this ability. If the creature who placed the eternal bond comes back to life or becomes mythic again, and this item is bonded to another, the bond reverts back to the eternally bonded creature at any time the eternally bonded creature wishes. Reinstating a bond in this way is a free action. If this item is broken, the bond is temporarily severed, but is reinstated when the item is repaired. Lastly, the bonded creature can't use the special ritual to relinquish the bond (see Mythic Bond on page 170).</p>\n<p>An item must be a minor or major artifact to have this ability. This is a persistent ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Everlasting:</strong> This ability grants its bearer limited immortality. While in contact with this item, the bonded creature doesn't age; doesn't need to eat, drink, or breathe; and doesn't suffer any ill effects from extreme heat or extreme cold.</p>\n<p>An item must be a major artifact to have this ability. This is a persistent ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Flexible Bond:</strong> The bonded creature can lend this item out with full utility to other creatures. As a standard action, the bonded creature can grant a temporary bond to a number of creatures equal to or less than her mythic tier. These creatures can be mythic or non-mythic. A creature with a temporary bond can fully utilize all of the item's legendary abilities, and if that creature has mythic power, he can expend it to use the item's legendary abilities that require legendary power use (including its legendary surge). This temporary bond ends either when the bonded creature wills it - a mental command requiring no action, which can be done at any time while she is conscious - or when the bond is broken between this item and its bonded creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Foe-Biting:</strong> When this item deals damage, its user can use mythic power to double the total amount of damage it deals. If the attack is a normal attack, the bearer can expend one use of legendary power to double the total amount of damage. If the attack is a confirmed critical hit, the bearer must instead expend two uses of legendary power to double the total damage. Damage from weapon special abilities (such as flaming) and precision-based damage are also doubled.</p>\n<p>This ability can be applied only to weapons. An item must be a minor or major artifact to have this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Intelligent:</strong> A legendary item with this ability becomes an intelligent magic item (Core Rulebook 523). When this ability is first selected, the legendary item starts with base Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of 10. The item gains speech as a supernatural ability. It can speak Common plus a number of additional languages based on its Intelligence score. The additional languages can be any that the bonded creature wants, except for secret languages (such as Druidic). The item gains senses with a range of 30 feet. Furthermore, this item always has the alignment of the bonded creature who first selected this ability.</p>\n<p>An intelligent legendary item has an Ego score, just like a non-mythic intelligent item, but it can never become dominant in its relationship with its bonded creature as long as the bonded creature's alignment corresponds to the item's (using the normal rules for intelligent items).</p>\n<p>This is a persistent ability. An intelligent legendary item gains a +4 bonus to its Ego when interacting with non-mythic wielders.</p>\n<p>You can select this ability more than once. Each time you do, you can increase its ability scores (to a maximum of 20 each) and select one of the following special abilities. You can increase all three of its ability scores by 2 points, or one of these ability scores by 4 points and one other ability score by 2 points.</p>\n<p>The special abilities are listed below. Some have another ability as a prerequisite.</p>\n<p><em>Animate:</em> This item can sprout limbs and move with a speed of 10 feet.</p>\n<p><em>Blindsense:</em> This item gains blindsense with the same range as its other senses. The item must have the darkvision ability to have this ability.</p>\n<p><em>Darkvision:</em> This item gains darkvision with the same range as its other senses.</p>\n<p><em>Expanded Senses (60 ft.):</em> The range of this item's senses increases to 60 feet.</p>\n<p><em>Expanded Senses (120 ft.):</em> The range of this item's senses increases to 120 feet. The item must have expanded senses (60 ft.) to have this ability.</p>\n<p><em>Fly:</em> The item gains a fly speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability. The item must have the animate ability to have this ability.</p>\n<p><em>Read Languages:</em> This item can read script in any language regardless of its known languages.</p>\n<p><em>Read Magic:</em> This item can read magical writing and scrolls as if using read magic. This ability doesn't allow the item to activate scrolls or other spell-completion items. The item can suppress and resume this ability as a free action.</p>\n<p><em>Shape Change:</em> The item can change its shape into one other form of the same size.</p>\n<p><em>Skill Ranks:</em> This item gains 10 ranks in one skill. This must be an Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill, unless the item has the animate ability (allowing it to choose Acrobatics) or the fly ability (allowing it to choose Fly).</p>\n<p><em>Spellcasting:</em> This item allows its bearer to cast a limited number of spells as spell-like abilities. This ability can be taken more than once. Each time it's taken, the bonded creature gains 5 points to spend on selecting what spells the item can cast. A spell costs a number of points equal to its level (minimum 1). The bearer can then activate the item to use each spell-like ability once per day. By spending double the cost, the bearer can use each spell-like ability three times per day. All spells must come from the same class's spell list. No spell can have a level higher than the bonded creature's tier. The caster level for these spells is equal to double the bonded creature's tier. The save DC for these spells is equal to 10 + the spell level + the bonded creature's tier.</p>\n<p><em>Telepathy:</em> This item can hold private mental conversations with its bearer, regardless of whether they share a known language. The item must be in physical contact with a creature to communicate this way.</p>\n<p><em>Teleport:</em> Once per day, the item can teleport as the spell. It must have either the spellcasting ability or the fly ability to have this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Legendary Fortification:</strong> When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored against a creature wearing an item with this ability, the wearer can expend one use of legendary power to negate the critical hit or sneak attack and instead take normal damage.</p>\n<p>Only armor, shields, and worn items can have this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Metamagician:</strong> This ability allows a spellcaster to apply a metamagic feat she knows to a spell as she casts it. She must expend a number of uses of legendary power equal to the increase of spell level the metamagic feat usually applies (minimum 1). This metamagic feat is applied spontaneously and without changing the casting time. This ability can be placed only on a head, headband, staff, ring, or rod legendary item.</p>\n<p><strong>Perfect Surge:</strong> This item's legendary surge can apply to any d20 roll. The surge adds a further +2 bonus when applied to one of the types of rolls initially chosen for it. A legendary item must be a major artifact to have this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Powerful:</strong> An item with this ability has two additional uses of legendary power per day. This ability can be taken up to three times. The item must be a minor or major artifact to take this a second time, and a major artifact to take this a third time. This is a persistent ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Rejuvenating:</strong> The bearer of this item can expend uses of legendary power to rejuvenate her body. As a standard action, she can expend one use of legendary power to heal herself of 10 points of damage per mythic tier she possesses. Alternatively, as a standard action she can expend two uses of legendary power to remove a single condition affecting her.</p>\n<p>A legendary item must be a minor or major artifact to have this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Returning:</strong> The creature bonded to this item can expend one use of mythic power to teleport the item to her waiting hand, as if using teleport object. The item must be on the same plane as the bonded creature for this ability to function. This ability can be taken a second time, allowing the item to cross planes to return to the bonded creature. The item must be a major artifact to take this ability again.</p>\n<p><strong>Undetectable:</strong> This grants its bonded user the ability to become utterly undetectable while invisible. While invisible and in physical contact with this item, the bonded creature can't be detected or scryed by any method.</p>\n<p><strong>Unstoppable Strike:</strong> This weapon bypasses all armor. The wielder can expend one use of legendary power when attacking to make the attack against touch AC. If she instead expends two uses of legendary power, the weapon also bypasses any deflection bonus to AC the target has.</p>\n<p>An item must be a weapon and be a minor or major artifact to have this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Unyielding:</strong> A legendary item with this ability has double the hardness of a typical item of its type and triple the hit points. Furthermore, it's immune to all attempts to sunder it made by non-mythic creatures. This is a persistent ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Upgradable:</strong> This ability grants the bonded creature the ability to more easily increase the non-mythic magical power of the legendary item. If the base magic item has a version with a higher bonus or greater version (such as a +1 longsword, a +2 light steel shield, a cloak of protection +3, an amulet of might fists +4, or a minor ring of inner fortitude), the bonded creature can improve it by performing a special ritual. She must spend a number of gold pieces equal to half the difference between the cost of the legendary item's current, non-mythic base item and the greater version she wishes to upgrade the item into. For example, she would pay 3,000 gp to upgrade a +1 longsword into a +2 longsword.</p>\n<p>This ritual takes 8 hours. When it's completed, the bonded creature transmutes the item's base version into the desired version. When upgraded in this fashion, the legendary item retains all legendary item abilities it had before the transmutation.</p>"}

The PCs still go on adventures, fight monsters, discover treasure, and gain experience. The difference is that mythic games have an added level of drama, theater, and tension. Compared to non-mythic parties of the same character level, a mythic party's adventures feature incredibly difficult foes and far greater challenges. Of course, there are also splendorous rewards for the bold mythic adventurer (see Chapter 5: Mythic Magic Items).</p>\n<p>This chapter gives guidelines for running a mythic campaign, including a discussion of what makes a game mythic, types of mythic games, rules for adjudicating the difficulty of encounters, and guidelines for advancing play and fulfilling trials.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Running a Mythic Game</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[mythicadventures.mythicadventures.tO7rJ2CapxmsdvaJ]{4.0.0 Running A Mythic Game}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[mythicadventures.mythicadventures.UCpjbyncaYnoRzJ2]{4.0.1.

The trees appear to have moved during the night, the road is missing, and the hill giant that just wandered into camp seems to think the heroes are creatures from childhood tales. Here, humans, dwarves, elves, halflings, and all the other common races are all thought to have been extinguished from the land long ago. The PCs also realize that they have newfound powers in this strange land. Little did they know that they camped near a mystical artifact that transported them to this new world due to unknown conditions that just happened to be right.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenges:</strong> To get back, the group must either locate a specific artifact - the twin of the one that transported them in the first place - or find another way to create a portal back. Many of the denizens tell the PCs about a wise woman who might be able to show them a way they could return, but lament that the queen captured her long ago.</p>\n<p>Survival in a land where the heroes are considered to be legendary, extinct creatures presents interesting opportunities for interaction. Groups might seek a favor or two before providing much needed information to the heroes. Normally hostile groups might worship the newcomers. Others that would have called them allies back home might instead view them as a threat, especially since the information and insights the newcomers bring threaten the balance of power and the land's fragile peace.</p>\n<p>If the heroes make their way to the queen's gigantic fortress, they find a new challenge before them, as every inhabitant is over twice their size. The queen's familiar, an enormous black cat, becomes a truly terrifying beast as it plays with new prey.</p>\n<p><strong>Adversary:</strong> For the PCs to rescue the wise woman, they must defeat the queen (who could be based on a type of mythic giant). For her part, she does not necessarily want the PCs dead right away, but instead wants to learn more about their world so that she can expand her domain.</p>\n<p><strong>Further Adventures:</strong> Other creatures might seek out the heroes' home world now that they know it exists. If the PCs don't kill the queen in her world, she may seek revenge in theirs. The PCs might learn that the queen sent the artifacts to other worlds and that she has many other captives who need the PCs' help. Perhaps the mythic power even remains when the PCs return home, only to discover their returning has awakened long-dormant mythic power across their world, unleashing many perils.</p>"}

For most, their journey is defined by such moments. These trials are the peaks of the story, turning points at which one wrong move or costly mistake might cause the entire quest to fail. In the game, these events denote the stages of the mythic character's journey. Think of trials as an important plot point, one that is intrinsically tied to the legend of the characters.</p>\n<p>Mythic characters advance in two ways: they gain character levels by accumulating experience points, and they gain tiers by accomplishing a number of trials (see Table 1-2: Mythic Trials per Tier on page 13). These trials are the true tales of mythic heroism, representing the culmination of an entire adventure or campaign arc in which the PCs overcome a terrifying challenge or achieve some fantastic victory. The trial can be anything the GM imagines, but it's not accomplished until some major goal is completed - be it to defeat a monster, save a town, or recover an artifact. So while an entire adventure might be a trial, it does not count toward advancement until the heroes complete it.</p>\n<p>The rate at which these trials are accomplished determines how quickly the PCs gain mythic tiers. As a guideline, the PCs should face a number of trials equal to the amount needed to gain a tier in the time it takes for them to gain two character levels. This should keep the character's mythic tier roughly equal to 1/2 the character's overall level. (Of course, the GM can alter this rate to suit the campaign.) That means if the PCs attain their first mythic tier at 1st level, they should probably face only a single greater trial by the time they reach 4th level, so that they reach 2nd tier at that time. Conversely, higher-level characters that gain mythic power later in their careers might face a number of trials in quick succession to gain tiers quickly, or they might even start with multiple tiers right away to get them closer to the average. Table 1-2 lists the number of trials a character must overcome to gain a new tier, but this number is subject to GM discretion and the needs of the story.</p>\n<p>A GM might instead decide that every time the PCs complete a trial, they gain a tier. In this case, such trials are far less common. Alternatively, a GM might double the number of trials needed, and in turn make them more common. Either way, the rate of tier progression shouldn't feel much different from what would normally happen.</p>\n<p>When designing a trial, GMs should keep the following points in mind. Trials represent important stories in the legend of mythic characters. Unlike an anecdote about a particularly nasty fight or dangerous trap, trials are lengthy tales of multiple dangerous encounters, against mythic foes and unimaginable adversity. A trial should be the culmination of an entire adventure or a short series of adventures.</p>\n<p>In addition, each trial should include at least three of the elements noted in Elements of a Mythic Adventure on page 122. These elements define a trial as mythic and help the players understand that they're approaching a vital stage of their journey without directly telling them that a trial is forthcoming.</p>"}

This part of the story can be nearly any length, from composing the middle of one session to encompassing dozens of sessions. The PCs, now enhanced with mythic power, must contend with various trials and dangers. Although these tests can take many different forms, there are some common types.</p>\n<p>One type of test is that of the heart, compelling the PCs to struggle for something they care about other than themselves. These tests provide the PCs with a goal other than their own well-being and power. There should be something threatened if they fail, which serves to give the PCs resolve, a reason to carry on. As they visit a city in the path of the monster, the PCs might encounter people who remind them of home, or of friends lost. Or they could find a child in the clutches of a enemy, only to learn that he's the key to their diabolical plan, and the PCs must succeed if they're to save him in time. If the threat is powerful enough, the PCs may even come to learn that their own survival is secondary their quest's completion.</p>\n<p>Temptation is another type of test, one that has different twists. Some temptations are obvious, and you expect the heroes to refuse, such as discovering a bucolic valley where they could forgo their journey and retire in peace, or a dubious stranger offering them a shortcut through a cursed forest. Such temptations are important to a mythic tale because refusal defines the characters and shows us their limits. Then there are the subtle temptations, ones that heroes might actually consider - either because the price seems small (or even nonexistent) compared to the gain or because the source seems trustworthy: taking food from an evil witch after starving for days, or choosing to give up a child they're protecting in exchange for an entire city's safety. Keep in mind that forces of good and evil are equally likely to test the heroes, to either reveal their mettle or lead them down the path of corruption. In any case, the PCs might be tempted a number of times along their journey and they must find the resolve to carry on and stay on the path.</p>\n<p>The PCs will eventually come to a point where they must confront the source of their own power, which provides another form of test. During their travels, they learn more and more about that source, ultimately revealing the truth about its nature. This might lead to a confrontation with the source of their power, after which the PCs feel they are equals to this source rather than its servants. For example, the PCs might learn their power comes from a divine source, and that deity is using them for its own ends. At great risk, they confront an aspect of the god to find answers. At the conclusion of the conflict, the PCs realize that while they're only a piece of the god's grand scheme, they're no mere pawns. Just as the god is using them to achieve her ends, they're using the god to achieve theirs.</p>\n<p>At the end of their journey, the PCs find their ultimate goal just within reach. Achieving this should be their most difficult test yet. Some foes are there to cull the unworthy, while others are agents of evil set to destroy the PCs. This last step in the journey should include a reward the likes of which the PCs have never seen, the culmination of their entire journey. With our earlier example, the PCs arrive at the resting place of the legendary sword capable of ending the tarrasque. Retrieving the sword from its ancient tomb is no easy task though, as the weapon is guarded by a host of mythic monsters and deadly traps. With the sword in hand, they must return to defeat the danger.</p>"}

If you're healed to full hit points, you come back to life and gain 1 permanent negative level for each minute you were dead (these negative levels can be removed as normal). Until you're healed to full hit points, you don't regain consciousness and are still dead no matter what other abilities you might have. If you aren't brought back to life within a number of minutes equal to your total character level, your death is permanent (although you can still be brought back by spells such as raise dead).</p>\n<p><strong>Companion Power (Su):</strong> You can imbue your bonded creature with your own mythic nature. Select one animal companion, eidolon, familiar, or bonded mount. This creature gains any one guardian path ability as if it were a 1st-tier guardian. If that ability can be used only by expending mythic power, your companion can instead use the ability three times per day.</p>\n<p><strong>Indomitable (Su):</strong> Select one of the following conditions: bleed, blinded, confused, dazed, deafened, entangled, fatigued, frightened, shaken, sickened, or staggered. You are immune to that condition. Greater and lesser versions of the selected condition (such as panicked, a more powerful version of frightened) still affect you.</p>\n<p><strong>Invincible Stand (Su):</strong> You can expend one use of mythic power as a swift action to make yourself nearly invincible for a short period of time. You gain DR 20/ - for a number of rounds equal to your tier. If you choose to move or are moved by another creature during this time, this protection immediately ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Resolve (Su):</strong> You're imbued with power and grace that protects you. Whenever you attempt a saving throw, you can expend one use of mythic power to roll again. You can use this ability more than once and take the highest result of all the rolls. You can use this ability only after the initial roll is made, but before the results are revealed. Using this ability doesn't require an action, and it can be used as long as you are conscious.</p>\n<p><strong>Take the Hit (Ex):</strong> You are a living shield for your allies. Whenever an adjacent ally takes damage from a melee or ranged attack, as an immediate action you can split the damage. You take half of the damage (rounded down), and your ally takes the remaining amount. This damage is not subject to any resistances or damage reduction you might have, but any such defenses the target of the attack possesses apply before the damage is split. You don't suffer any other effects from the attack (such as disease, grab, or poison).</p>\n<p>Special Abilities</p>"}

You can continue to apply excess healing to other adjacent allies until no injured allies are adjacent or you run out of excess healing. For example, if you could cure 40 points of damage with your cure critical wounds spell and the target has taken only 20 points of damage, you can apply the remaining 20 points of healing to an adjacent ally; if that second ally has taken only 15 points of damage, you can apply the remaining 5 points of healing to another adjacent ally.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment Insight (Ex):</strong> You can automatically detect the alignment of any outsider you can see. This ability doesn't function if the creature is magically disguised or has been polymorphed into a different shape. You can automatically detect the alignment of any creature you see casting a divine spell; if that creature worships a deity, you also learn its deity. Spells and effects that mask a creature's alignment prevent the use of this ability. Whenever you cast a spell that affects creatures differently based on their alignment (such as holy smite), you may have the spell treat creatures of one particular alignment as an alignment one step away from that alignment. For example, when casting holy smite, you could treat all lawful neutral creatures as lawful good or lawful evil, all chaotic neutral creature as chaotic good or chaotic evil, or all neutral creatures as neutral good or neutral evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Animal Friend (Ex):</strong> If you have the wild empathy ability, you can use it as a free action once per round. If you don't have that ability, you can instead attempt Diplomacy checks (with a -8 penalty) to improve the attitude of animals as if they were intelligent creatures. Add your tier to wild empathy or Diplomacy checks to influence animals.</p>\n<p><strong>Blessed Companion (Su):</strong> Select one animal companion, eidolon, familiar, or bonded mount. It gains DR 5/epic. This ability can be taken a second time at 6th tier or higher and a third time at 9th tier or higher. Each additional time it's taken, the DR increases by 5.</p>\n<p><strong>Divine Metamastery (Su):</strong> As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power and pick any one metamagic feat you know that increases the slot level of the spell by 0 levels or 1 level. For the next 10 rounds, you can apply this metamagic feat to any divine spell you cast without increasing the spell slot used or casting time. You can also use this ability on a divine spell cast from a scroll, staff, or wand. You can't have more than one use of this ability active at a time. If you use this ability again, any previous use immediately ends (though any metamagic effects on spells already cast remain). You can select this ability more than once. Each time you select it, the maximum spell slot level increase of the metamagic feat goes up by 1 to a maximum of 4.</p>\n<p><strong>Divine Potency (Su):</strong> Choose one of your divine spellcasting classes. You gain four bonus 1st-level divine spell slots for that class (like the bonus spells gained from a high ability score). This doesn't change your number of spells known. You can select this ability more than once. If you choose the same divine spellcasting class a second time, you gain four bonus 2nd-level spell slots; if you choose it again, you gain 3rd-level slots for choosing it a third time, and so on. This ability can't grant you bonus spells for a spell level that you don't have the ability to cast.</p>\n<p><strong>Domain Immunity (Su):</strong> You don't take damage or suffer harmful effects from spells on your domain spell list, even ones you aren't of a high enough level to cast. If you're targeted by any of these spells, as an immediate action you can expend one use of mythic power to turn the spell back upon the original caster as if using spell turning. Beneficial effects of spells on your domain spell list affect you normally. If you're an oracle, this ability applies to your mystery's bonus spells. You must have the domain class feature or mystery class feature.</p>\n<p><strong>Enduring Blessing (Su):</strong> Whenever you cast a spell with a duration of 10 minutes per level or longer upon one willing target, you can change that spell's duration to 24 hours. If the spell has other duration conditions, those still apply (for example, the duration of stoneskin changes to 24 hours or until discharged). A creature can't be subject to more than one spell affected by this ability at a time; if another is cast upon the creature, the first one ends. You can select this ability a second time at 6th tier or higher. The second time you select it, you can use it on spells with a duration of 1 minute per level or longer.</p>\n<p><strong>Hand of Mercy (Su):</strong> If you have the channel energy ability, you can touch a creature and expend one use of channel energy to remove a condition afflicting that creature. Each time you use this ability, you can choose one of the following conditions: dazed, fatigued, shaken, sickened, or staggered. At 6th tier, you can also choose from among the cursed, exhausted, frightened, and nauseated conditions. At 9th tier, you can also choose from among the blinded, deafened, paralyzed, and stunned conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>Hurling Vengeance (Su):</strong> Whenever you are wielding your deity's favored weapon or your paladin bonded weapon, you can throw it as if it had the returning and throwing weapon special abilities. If using a paladin bonded weapon, it retains its bonded abilities when thrown this way. By expending one use of mythic power as part of a full attack, the weapon returns to you immediately after each time you throw it (instead of just before your next turn) allowing you to make your full number of attacks that round.</p>\n<p><strong>Life Current (Su):</strong> You are more attuned to the source of life or unlife and better able to access its power. When casting a cure or inflict spell or use a class feature that uses positive or negative energy (such as channel energy or lay on hands), treat any natural 1s on the dice rolled to heal or deal damage as 2s. You can select this ability up to four times. The second time you select it, treat natural 1s and 2s as 3s. The third time you select it, treat natural 1s, 2s, and 3s as 4s. The fourth time, treat natural 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s as 5s.</p>\n<p>Special Abilities</p>"}

A mythic lich uses the base lich's stats and abilities except as noted here.</p><p><strong>Mythic Subtype:</strong> A mythic lich gains the mythic subtype, with a rank equal to half the CR of the base lich. A mythic lich gains additional abilities depending on the base lich's CR instead of the mythic abilities it would get for having a rank. The mythic lich gains all other benefits of having the mythic subtype: ability score bonuses, bonus hit points, mythic feats, mythic power, natural armor bonus, and spell resistance increase (if any).</p><p><strong>CR:</strong> Adjust the base lich's CR according to its mythic rank (this template doesn't increase the base lich's CR other than from the mythic rank). Note that a mythic lich's abilities on Table 6-1 depend on the base lich's CR, not the final CR of the mythic lich.</p><p><strong>Tier:</strong> A lich with mythic tiers that becomes a mythic lich loses its tiers (and all abilities from those tiers) and gains abilities from the mythic lich template, according to the base lich's CR.</p><p><strong>Channel Resistance (Su):</strong> A mythic lich's channel resistance increases to +8. At 8th tier, it increases to +12. At 10th rank, the lich becomes immune to channeled energy from non-mythic sources (except when used to heal undead).</p><p><strong>Creeping Paralysis (Su):</strong> A creature that strikes a mythic lich with a natural weapon, unarmed strike, or non-reach manufactured weapon, or otherwise touches the lich must save or be affected by the lich's paralyzing touch ability. This triggers only once per round per creature.</p><p><strong>Mythic Phylactery (Su):</strong> A mythic lich's phylactery can't be harmed by non-mythic sources. At 8th rank, the phylactery becomes a minor artifact, and can be destroyed by only one specific method.</p><p><strong>Mythic Potency (Su):</strong> A mythic lich adds its rank to the save DCs for its fear aura and paralyzing touch abilities.</p><p><strong>Mythic Spells (Su):</strong> A mythic lich gains Mythic Spell Lore as a bonus feat. The lich has a pool of magical power it can draw upon for casting mythic spells. Up to twice per day, it can use this power to cast a mythic spell without expending any uses of mythic power.</p><p><strong>Spell Resistance (Su):</strong> A mythic lich gains spell resistance equal to 11 + the base lich's CR (before adding the lich's mythic rank to its SR from the mythic subtype).</p><p><strong>Augmented Spellcasting (Su):</strong> At 7th rank, a mythic lich selects one of the following archmage or hierophant abilities: arcane surge (see page 14), inspired spell (see page 32), recalled blessing (see page 32), or wild arcana (see page 14). Once chosen, this selection can't be changed.</p><p><strong>Spell Perception (Su):</strong> At 7th rank, a mythic lich automatically notices spellcasting within 60 feet. The lich automatically pinpoints the location of the caster, identifies the spell being cast, and knows the intended target or area of the spell.</p><p><strong>Immediate Counterspell (Su):</strong> At 8th rank, a mythic lich can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to attempt to counter a spell. The lich must use a spell, spell slot, or dispel magic to counterspell as normal. This ability allows the lich to counterspell without first readying an action.</p><p><strong>Enhanced Spellcasting (Su):</strong>  At 9th rank, a mythic lich gains the ability to treat its 1st-level spells like cantrips or orisons. If the mythic lich is a spontaneous caster, its 1st-level spells known don't consume spell slots and can be used again. If the mythic lich prepares spells, its 1st-level spell slots aren't expended when cast and can be used again. Using metamagic feats or other abilities that alter the spell slot of a spell aren't affected by this ability (for example, a quickened magic missile uses a 5th-level spell slot and is expended when cast).</p><p><strong>Sustained by Magic (Su):</strong> At 9th rank, each time a mythic lich casts a spell it regains hit points equal to three times the level of the spell slot used to cast the spell.</p><p><strong>Formidable Animation (Su):</strong> At 10th rank, a mythic lich gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws. Any opponent attempting a dispel check against an effect on the lich rolls twice and uses the lower result. Anytime the lich attempts a dispel check, it rolls twice and uses the higher result.</p><h1>Table 6-1: Mythic Lich Abilities</h1><table><tr decoration=\"underline\"><td><strong>Base Lich's CR</strong></td><td><strong>Mythic Rank</strong></td><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Mythic Abilities</strong></td></tr><tr><td>12-13</td><td>6th</td><td colspan=\"3\">Channel resistance +8, creeping paralysis, mythic phylactery, mythic potency, mythic spells, spell resistance</td></tr><tr><td>14-15</td><td>7th</td><td colspan=\"3\">Augmented spellcasting, spell perception</td></tr><tr><td>16-17</td><td>8th</td><td colspan=\"3\">Channel resistance +12, immediate counterspell</td></tr><tr><td>18-19</td><td>9th</td><td colspan=\"3\">Enhanced spellcasting, sustained by magic</td></tr><tr><td>20+</td><td>10th</td><td colspan=\"3\">Channel resistance (immunity), formidable animation</td></tr></table></text>\n            "}

Generally speaking, the GM determines this</p>\n<p>event, which has many implications on the story of the character. Ascension determines the source of a mythic character's power, and though this doesn't affect the types of abilities she gains, it can influence future choices and roleplaying decisions.</p>\n<p>The GM is free to invent any sort of event to serve as the moment of ascension, as required by the needs of the campaign. Chapter 4 includes more information for GMs to consider when designing the moment of ascension. The following ideas represent some of the most common means of ascension.</p>\n<p><strong>Artifact:</strong> The character comes into contact with an unstable artifact that unleashes some of its power into her, granting her mythic power. The mythic character might need to protect the artifact, as it is the source of her power.</p>\n<p><strong>Fated:</strong> The character was born under an auspicious sign, such as a planetary conjunction or lunar eclipse, and as such was destined to greatness. The moment of ascension comes when those circumstances repeat themselves and the character gains mythic power.</p>\n<p><strong>Godling:</strong> The mythic character is the child of a god, typically born from the union of that deity and a mortal. The moment of ascension is when the character learns of her true heritage or is visited by her divine parent (or an agent of that deity).</p>\n<p><strong>Granted:</strong> A divine agent or other incredibly powerful being calls upon the character to act as its representative. This role gives the character mythic power, but possibly only while serving the interests of this benefactor and while holding to that patron's tenets.</p>\n<p><strong>Passed On:</strong> The character is present at the death of a powerful - perhaps even mythic - creature. In its final moments, it passes on its power to the character, granting mythic abilities. Alternatively, its power might not be given voluntarily, but rather taken by the PCs when they slaying a mythic creature.

{"_id":"wyyDaftikB19XfK6","name":"6.4.1. Create A New Monster","permission":{"default":0,"xdjh9CzHvgUgsBmZ":3},"folder":"","flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_112mg9268jna","path":"Pathfinder Mythic Adventures Reference Library#/CP_SEP/Chapter 6 Mythic MonsterS#/CP_SEP/Building A Mythic Creature","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<p>Creating a new mythic monster is especially challenging because you're basically creating a monster with two CRs - an initial CR, which determines its appropriate mythic rank and thus how many mythic abilities it gets, and its final CR, which determines appropriate values for its AC, hit points, damage per round, and so on. Though it's possible to create the monster all at once with a particular CR and MR in mind, it's generally easier to build it in several steps (some of which are very similar to the steps for modifying an existing monster).</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1 - Estimate its final CR.</strong> Knowing the intended CR of your new monster is critical. This target helps determine the starting power level for your monster in the later steps, and means you won't have to reconfigure your monster if it's too weak or too powerful. For example, you might want a CR 7 mythic monster to challenge a 5th-level mythic party.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2 - Determine its mythic rank (MR).</strong> Divide your final CR by 2.5 to get the approximate mythic rank of your monster. If the result is not a whole number, it just means you have some flexibility in choosing the MR. For example, if your final CR is 7, dividing that by 2.5 is 2.8, so your monster could be 2nd rank or 3rd rank. It's generally easier to start with a lower MR - you can always increase the MR later if you need the monster to be a little more powerful.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3 - Determine its initial CR.</strong> Subtract half the MR from the final CR to get the initial CR. If the final CR is 7 and the MR is 2, half of 2 is 1, so the initial CR is 7 - 1 = 6.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4 - Build a new monster for that initial CR.</strong> This is identical to the process for creating a non-mythic monster. Follow the guidelines in the Pathfinder Rpg Bestiary, creating a creature balanced for its CR, or starting with a base creature known to be appropriate for its CR and altering that monster to suit your purposes.</p>\n<p>The next three steps make the creature mythic.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5 - Add the mythic subtype.</strong> The mythic subtype is described on page 226. The modifications to the creature's ability scores, hit points, and so on depend on its MR.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 6 - Add additional mythic abilities.</strong> As described in the mythic subtype, the monster gains a number of mythic abilities equal to its MR + 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 7 - Evaluate the monster at its final CR.</strong> Your monster's final CR is its initial CR + 1/2 its MR (which should be close to your estimate from Step 1). If half the MR isn't an even number, round down to get the monster's final CR. Use Table 6-8: Monster Statistics by CR (see page 229) to evaluate whether the monster's abilities are appropriately challenging for its final CR. If a creature's mythic abilities complement its non-mythic abilities particularly well, that mythic creature may be too powerful for its final CR. If a creature's mythic abilities don't interact with its non-mythic abilities, that creature may be too weak for its final CR. If either of these situations occur, make adjustments to the monster so it better fits the intended CR.</p>\n<p>If the monster is too weak and the MR from Step 2 isn't a whole number, increase the monster's MR by 1 (adjusting the modifiers from the mythic subtype). If the monster is too strong and you have to round down to get its final CR, compare the monster to the statistics for the next highest CR. Once the monster's abilities and statistics fit its CR, you're done.</p>"}

When making a charge attack, you can expend one use of mythic power to include a single Acrobatics check made to jump, adding 10 feet per tier to the height or distance you jump. You take no falling damage from the height gained as part of this leap. If your attack hits, you may deal an amount of additional damage equal to the falling damage appropriate for the height you reached. Alternatively, you may replace your melee attack from this charge with a grapple check. If you successfully grapple a creature, you bring it to the ground with you at the end of your jump, and it takes an appropriate amount of falling damage for the height it was at when you grappled it.</p>\n<p><strong>Always a Chance (Ex):</strong> You don't automatically miss when you roll a 1 on an attack roll.</p>\n<p><strong>Always Armed (Ex):</strong> You don't take any penalties from using an improvised weapon. In addition, whenever you confirm a critical hit with an improvised weapon, you can treat its critical multiplier as &times;3 instead of &times;2, but the weapon is destroyed.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Master (Ex):</strong> You don't take an armor check penalty or incur a arcane spell failure chance when wearing light armor or using a shield (including a tower shield). In addition, the maximum Dexterity bonus of light armor doesn't apply to you. You can select this ability up to three times. The second time, it also applies to medium armor. The third time, it also applies to heavy armor.</p>\n<p><strong>Backlash (Ex):</strong> You strike back at those who penetrate your defenses. Whenever an adjacent enemy confirms a critical hit against you, that enemy also provokes an attack of opportunity from you. If you have used all of your attacks of opportunity for the round, you may expend one use of mythic power to make this attack of opportunity anyway.</p>\n<p><strong>Blowback (Ex):</strong> As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to make one melee or ranged attack at your full base attack bonus. If the attack hits, your foe is also knocked directly away from you a distance equal to 10 feet per tier. If the foe strikes a solid object before reaching this distance, it takes 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it couldn't travel. If it strikes another creature, both it and the creature it strikes take half this damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Burst Through (Ex):</strong> When you charge, you can move through allies and opponents almost as if they were not there to obstruct your path. You can move through squares containing allies freely, but you must succeed at an overrun combat maneuver check for each opponent that obstructs your path to the target of your charge. If the result of the check exceeds the opponent's Cmd, you may move through the opponent's square and continue toward the target without provoking an attack of opportunity from that opponent. If you fail any of these combat maneuver checks, your movement ends in the square before that opponent, but you may resolve the charge attack against the foe that stopped you.</p>\n<p><strong>Clean Blade (Ex):</strong> Whenever you score a critical hit, as a free action you can make a ranged touch attack to fling the blood and gore at another opponent within 30 feet. If the touch attack hits, the foe is sickened for a number of rounds equal to your tier. If the touch attack is a critical hit, the foe is also blinded for the same duration. A blinded foe can spend a full-round action to remove the gore and end the blindness. At the GM's discretion, creatures that are immune to disease, those that live in filth (such as otyughs), or those that revel in bloodshed (such as demons) might be immune to the sickened effect of this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Climbing Master (Ex):</strong> You gain a climb speed equal to your base land speed and a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks. If you already have a climb speed, your base climb speed increases by 30 feet. In addition, you retain your Dexterity bonus to AC while climbing. You can climb perfectly flat or smooth surfaces, treating them as if they had a Climb DC of 40.</p>\n<p><strong>Crusader (Ex):</strong> Your prowess and ability draw countless followers to your banner. You gain followers as if you had the Leadership feat. In addition, you add your tier to your leadership score when determining the number of followers you gain. Whenever you are within 100 feet of such followers, each follower can use the surge ability once per day without needing to expend mythic power. The followers use the same die type as your surge ability. If you have or gain the Leadership feat, you gain followers from both this ability and the Leadership feat (in effect doubling the number of followers gained).</p>\n<p><strong>Devastating Smash (Su):</strong> Whenever you attack a construct or object, treat its hardness (or damage reduction in the case of constructs) as 10 less than normal. Add your tier to damage rolls against constructs and objects. If you expend one use of mythic power as part of an attack against a construct or object, you treat its hardness (or damage reduction) as 0 and add double your tier to damage instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Endless Hatred (Ex):</strong> You can expend one use of mythic power as a free action to increase all of your favored enemy bonuses by 2 for 1 minute. When you use this ability, for the rest of your turn any attacks you make against a favored enemy bypass all damage reduction. You must have the favored enemy class feature to select this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Ever Ready (Ex):</strong> Whenever you make an attack of opportunity, you gain a bonus on the attack roll and damage roll equal to your mythic tier. You can make attacks of opportunity while flat-footed, even if you don't have the Combat Reflexes feat. At 3rd, 6th, and 9th tier, the number of attacks of opportunity you can make each round increases by one.</p>\n<p><strong>Flash of Rage (Ex):</strong> Whenever you or an ally within 30 feet is struck by a critical hit, you can enter a rage as a free action on your next turn. This rage functions as the barbarian class feature, and lasts a number of rounds equal to your tier. You aren't fatigued after this rage. If you have the rage class feature, these rounds don't count toward your daily uses of that ability, you can use abilities that require patience and concentration while in this rage (although you are still restricted when using your rage class feature normally), and these rounds of rage don't count toward the total number of rounds of rage used when determining how long you are fatigued. Rounds of rage granted by this ability don't stack, but the duration is reset if another critical hit occurs.</p>\n<p><strong>Impossible Speed (Ex):</strong> Your base land speed increases by 30 feet. In addition, if you expend one use of mythic power, for 1 hour your base land speed increases by 10 feet per mythic tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Imprinting Hand (Su):</strong> By touching a foe, you can gain knowledge about it, including its weaknesses. To use this ability, you must first successfully hit a foe with an unarmed strike, natural weapon, or melee touch attack to make contact, then use this ability is a free action. As long as the target remains within 1 mile of you, you always know the direction and approximate distance to it. If the foe has any weaknesses or vulnerabilities (including a mythic flaw), you immediately know this information. You can maintain this connection with only one creature at a time; if you use this ability on another creature, your connection with the previous creature is lost.</p>\n<p><strong>Lesson Learned (Ex):</strong> Whenever you fail a saving throw against a supernatural or spell-like ability, you gain a +5 bonus on all further saving throws against that ability, including subsequent saves against an ongoing effect, or against the same effect produced by a different source or creature. This bonus lasts for a number of minutes equal to your tier. For example, if you fail a save against a demon's fireball spell-like ability, you gain this bonus against a fireball spell-like ability from any creature; if you fail a save against a blue dragon's electricity breath weapon, you gain this bonus against all blue dragon electricity breath weapons, but not against a black dragon's acid breath weapon or a gorgon's petrification breath weapon. If you fail another saving throw against the same ability, the duration of lesson learned resets but the bonus doesn't stack with itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Limitless Range (Ex):</strong> Multiply the range increment on all of your ranged and thrown weapons by 5 feet, and these weapons no longer have a maximum range increment for you. You can throw any melee weapon as if it had a range increment of 20 feet - this increment isn't multiplied by 5, but the weapon doesn't have a maximum range increment.</p>\n<p><strong>Meat Shield (Ex):</strong> You can use a creature you're grappling to protect you from harm. If you're grappling a creature and are attacked with a melee or ranged attack, as an immediate action you can attempt a grapple combat maneuver check against your grappled opponent. If you succeed, the incoming attack targets your grappled opponent instead of you. If you fail, the grappled opponent breaks free from the grapple and the incoming attack targets you as normal.</p>\n<p><strong>Mounted Maniac (Ex):</strong> Your unstoppable momentum while mounted is terrifying. Whenever you charge a creature while mounted, you can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize all enemies within 30 feet of your target, adding your tier to the result of the check. If you expend one use of mythic power, any creature demoralized by this ability is frightened instead of shaken. The duration of this condition is dependent upon your check, as noted in the Intimidate skill.</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Ki (Su):</strong> As a free action, you can expend one use of mythic power to regain 2 points in your ki pool (up to your maximum). For the rest of your turn, your successful attacks with unarmed strikes or monk weapons bypass all damage reduction. You must have the ki pool class feature to select this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Rage (Su):</strong> As a free action, you can expend one use of mythic power to regain 1/4 your maximum number of rage rounds (minimum 4 rounds). For the rest of your turn, your successful attacks while raging bypass all damage reduction. You must have the rage class feature to select this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Smite (Su):</strong> As a free action, you can expend one use of mythic power to regain one use of your smite evil ability. For the rest of your turn, your successful attacks against evil creatures bypass all damage reduction. You must have the smite evil class feature to select this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Weapon Training (Ex):</strong> Select one group of weapons from the list of fighter weapon groups. You gain proficiency with all weapons in this group. If you possess a feat such as Weapon Focus that requires you to choose a kind of weapon, you can instead apply the effects of that feat to all weapons from that weapon group. When wielding a weapon from that group, add a number equal to your tier to your Cmd against disarm and sunder attempts made against that weapon. You can select this ability more than once. Each time you select this ability, it applies to a different weapon group.</p>\n<p><strong>Punishing Blow (Ex):</strong> Any opponent you hit with a melee or ranged attack loses the benefits of regeneration and fast healing for 1 round. In addition, if you score a critical hit against the target, it loses the benefit of its damage reduction for 1 round. A creature whose regeneration can't be suppressed or ignored (such as the tarrasque) is immune to this effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Sunder Storm (Ex):</strong> As a full-round action, you can expend one use of mythic power to attempt a sunder combat maneuver against each opponent within reach, selecting one item on each opponent to sunder. The damage from these sunder attempts ignores item hardness. If you destroy an item in this way, you drive the shattered pieces of the item into the flesh of its wearer or wielder, dealing 1d6 + a number of points equal to your tier of piercing damage. This damage bypasses all damage reduction.</p>\n<p><strong>Swimming Master (Ex):</strong> You gain a swim speed equal to your base land speed and a +8 racial bonus on Swim checks. If you already have a swim speed, your base swim speed increases by 30 feet. You can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to 10 &times; your Constitution score, but afterward you must succeed at checks as normal to avoid drowning. If you expend one use of mythic power, for 1 hour your base swim speed increases by 10 feet per mythic tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Tear Apart (Ex):</strong> You can attempt to rend the armor of your opponent, reducing its effectiveness. Using this ability is a standard action that requires you to attempt a sunder combat maneuver check against your foe. If the check is successful, reduce the target's armor bonus, natural armor bonus, or shield bonus (your choice) by half your tier (minimum 1). If the creature has an enhancement bonus to the bonus you chose, reduce the normal bonus first, then apply any leftover reduction to the enhancement bonus. You can't reduce the bonus below 0. Armor and shields damaged in this way can be repaired as if they had the broken condition. Natural armor regains the lost bonus at the rate of 1 point per day. Lesser restoration restores 1d4 points of natural armor bonus, and restoration restores all of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Titan's Bane (Ex):</strong> You can move through the space of any creature two or more size categories larger than you without provoking attacks of opportunity, and you can share such a creature's space. When sharing a larger opponent's space, you gain cover against all melee and ranged attacks made by the creature, and it is considered flat-footed for the purposes of any melee or ranged attacks you make against it.</p>\n<p><strong>Uncanny Grapple (Ex):</strong> Upon making a successful grapple combat maneuver check against a creature you are grappling, you can perform one of the following actions: throw, crush, or swing. For a throw, you can throw the target of your grapple up to 10 feet per tier; if the creature strikes a solid object before reaching this distance, it takes 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of the remaining throwing distance and lands prone. For a crush, you deal 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per tier. For a swing, you can use the target as a weapon against another creature, treating the grappled creature as a two-handed weapon. If you succeed at a melee attack against an opponent adjacent to the target, both that opponent and the grappled creature take 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage from this attack + 1-1/2 &times; your Strength modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Wall Smasher (Ex):</strong> Whenever you succeed at a ki throw or a bull rush or reposition combat maneuver, you can smash your opponent against a wall (or suitable large obstacle) within the range you could move the target into as a result of the maneuver, dealing unarmed strike damage to your opponent and the wall. If you expend one use of mythic power when you use this ability, this damage ignores the hardness of the wall. If the damage destroys the wall, you move the opponent into the space beyond the wall and it immediately falls prone.</p>\n<p>Special Abilities</p>"}

As a result, the PCs now have access to a wide range of abilities they once considered unthinkable.</p>\n<p>A messenger of the gods appears to the PCs, asking them to deliver a relic to a plane where even the gods fear to tread. It gives them each a blessing that, upon entering this fearsome plane, provides protections through ascension.</p>\n<p>Found guilty of high treason for a crime they didn't commit, the PCs are sentenced by a tribunal to wander the endless planes, wearing the \"collars of judgment,\" until they prove themselves worthy to return. They now jump from plane to plane, attempting to defeat other threats to their homeland. The collars around their necks give them access to mythic powers and transport them to their next labor when they finish their current one. Hopefully their last will be against the one who framed them.</p>\n<p><strong>Story:</strong> While some planes function much like the Material Plane - in that they have gravity, breathable air, etc. - other planes have truly alien environs. Several of the latter augment those who enter to allow them to survive; this power sometimes lasts only while a visitor is on that plane, while other times it's permanent. (Some believe this augmentation occurs when latent abilities that reside in all life forms are triggered.) In other instances, special items or rituals grant these powers during travel through specific planes.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenges:</strong> The planes are full of unpredictable oddities and surreal monsters. Many of these creatures are incredibly powerful without being mythic at all, making them more than a match for the PCs. Despite their power, the PCs must tread lightly in the presence of archangels and demon princes. Ultimately, they will have to face such beings, even if they start by challenging their minions and other, lesser agents.</p>\n<p><strong>Ending:</strong> At the end of their journey, the heroes must ultimately face some sort of gatekeeper that keeps them from going home. This creature might literally be preventing their travel, or it might be so great a threat that it must be defeated before the heroes can return to their ordinary lives. Even if the PCs traveled to the plane accidentally, there should be some incredibly powerful force standing in the way of their return to normal life.</p>"}

These values are rough guidelines. You'll notice that many of the existing monsters in this book don't follow these guidelines exactly. Most monsters excel in one of these areas (usually in the amount of damage dealt), but lag in one or two other areas to balance them out. For example, a monster might have higher damage than what's listed in the table, but have a lower AC and hit points. The entries on the table are as follows.</p><p><strong>CR:</strong> This is the approximate CR of the monster. This number might change as the design progresses.</p><p><strong>Hit Points:</strong> This is the approximate hit point total for the monster. A creature with a particularly high AC, especially large saving throw bonuses, or a number of resistances might have a lower number. Outsiders and constructs typically have lower hit point totals.</p><p><strong>Armor Class:</strong> This is the average AC for a creature of this CR. When it comes time to design the creature's protections, keep this number in mind. Creatures whose hit point totals are above average typically have lower AC to compensate.</p><p><strong>High Attack:</strong> This is the average total attack bonus for a creature of this CR that is primarily a melee or ranged combatant. Creatures with a higher than normal average damage typically have a lower attack value to compensate.</p><p><strong>Low Attack:</strong> This is the average total attack bonus for a creature of this CR that doesn't rely upon melee or ranged attacks to deal damage. This includes most creatures that mainly use spells and spell-like abilities in combat.</p><p><strong>Average Damage:</strong> This is the average amount of damage dealt by a creature of this CR if all of its attacks are successful. To determine a creature's average damage, add the average value for all of the damage dice rolled (as determined by Table 1-5: Average Die Results on page 293 of the Bestiary) to the damage modifier for each attack.</p><p>A creature that relies on melee or ranged weapons in combat should have average damage within the range of high and low damage.</p><p>A creature with higher than normal attack bonuses often deals less damage, and a creature with lower than normal attack bonuses often deals more damage.</p><p><strong>Primary Ability DC:</strong> This is the average difficulty class (DC) for any spells, spell-like abilities, and special abilities (such as breath weapons) possessed by a creature of this CR that relies on such attacks in combat. If an ability is particularly powerful, it might have a lower DC to compensate for that.</p><p><strong>Secondary Ability DC:</strong> This is the average DC for spells and special abilities for a creature that does not rely on such attacks in combat. Generally, an ability's DC should not be lower than this number.</p><p><strong>Good Save:</strong> This is the average saving throw bonus for a creature of this CR, if the saving throw is one of the creature's good saving throws.</p><p><strong>Poor Save:</strong> This is the average saving throw bonus for a creature of this CR, if the saving throw is one of the creature's poor saving throws.</p></text>\n            "}

That power has faded from this world, but once an age, when the time is right, mythic power returns for a short time.</p>\n<p><strong>Scope:</strong> In this theme, mythic power is a rarity, held only by a few who often hide from the world and those who would seek to take it from them. To widen the scope, mythic power might be returning to the world, heralded by some grand conjunction of events.</p>\n<p><strong>Ascension:</strong> A celestial event marks the return of mythic power to the world. Possibly by accident, the PCs are standing in just the right place at the time of this omen, and are imbued with such power. The PCs are not alone, however - others were also at different places of power at the same time.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of an adventure, the PCs learn that their births had been carefully arranged over the past 100 years in an attempt to recreate a powerful, mythic lineage long thought to be lost. With this discovery, they also find the means to unlocking their potential.</p>\n<p>Exploring a fabled lost city, the PCs learn its inhabitants held power far beyond that of their modern cousins. The secret to this magic came from a special ritual that could only be performed once every 1,000 years, but it came at a terrible price and with a great deal of risk. The next ritual is fast approaching, presenting an opportunity for the PCs to become mythic if they choose to pursue this dangerous path.</p>\n<p><strong>Story:</strong> With these adventures, mythic power itself is the story. They contain a great deal of mystery, as there are few in the world who know about mythic power and what perils come along with wielding it. The PCs travel around the world, seeking knowledge of its origins, what caused its downfall, and how it can be used. Of course, others have also learned about this power, and they intend to use it for nefarious ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenges:</strong> The PCs aren't the only ones to gain mythic power from this source. Perhaps there are others of this bloodline, or other creatures that discover a way to awaken power within them. Most mysterious, however, are creatures from the lost age, returned to the world to take back what they see as rightfully theirs - whether that's the mythic power or the whole world.</p>\n<p><strong>Ending:</strong> As events draw to a conclusion, the PCs must choose whether this power remains in the world. Keeping it for themselves means the power can be taken by other villains, and the heroes will need to keep constant vigil for the sake of their mythic nature. Or they can let this power fade away, even knowing there are other threats out there that could use their mythic talents. Alternatively, there may be no choice in the matter; the power has returned and the PCs must find a way to deal with it. In any case, the villains that seek to abuse this power must be stopped, no matter the cost.</p>"}

Allies within 30 feet of you don't become unconscious or disabled when reduced to 0 hit points or fewer. As soon as you and an ally at 0 hit points or fewer are more than 30 feet apart, that ally becomes unconscious or disabled. You can expend one use of mythic power to stabilize all dying allies within 30 feet and let all allies within this range ignore the staggered condition for a number of rounds equal to your tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Caster's Friend (Ex):</strong> You bolster the concentration of spellcasting allies standing next to you. A spellcaster who is adjacent to you gains a bonus on concentration checks equal to your tier. Furthermore, if a spellcaster fails a concentration check while adjacent to you, as an immediate action you can expend one use of mythic power to allow that spellcaster to instead automatically succeed at that concentration check.</p>\n<p><strong>Commanding Presence (Ex):</strong> Your force of presence is so overwhelming that others know what you want and can comprehend what you are saying even if they don't understand the words you speak. You can use your body language and tone of voice alone to ask questions and make statements to those who don't know your language. When they answer or respond to your communications, you must succeed at a DC 20 Sense Motive check to get the general idea of what they are saying in return. Furthermore, when you use a spell or ability with the language-dependent descriptor, you can still affect creatures that cannot understand the language you are using, but they must be able to hear you and must have an Intelligence score of 1 or higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Confidence (Su):</strong> You can draw upon a deep reserve of confidence in times of need. You can call on confidence three times per day to use the surge mythic ability without expending one use of mythic power. You can select this ability up to three times. Each additional time you select it, you gain three additional uses of confidence per day.</p>\n<p><strong>Demagogue (Su):</strong> You have an unnatural ability to call and sway crowds with your commanding presence and flawless rhetoric. When in a small town or larger settlement, you can expend one use of mythic power to gather a crowd (Core Rulebook 436). Doing so takes 4d10 minutes. Add your tier to your Charisma bonus and then multiply the sum by 5 to determine how many creatures are in the crowd (as long as the settlement has a sufficient population to provide a crowd of that size, as determined by the GM). For example, a 4th-tier marshal with a +6 bonus to Charisma could gather as many as 50 creatures. The crowd remains for 1 hour, and you gain a +10 competence bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks to direct the crowd. You can expend another use of mythic power to extend the effect for another hour. This is a language-dependent effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Dispel Fear (Su):</strong> You can rally your allies and relieve their fear. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to either end all fear effects affecting allies within 30 feet of you, or end all fear effects on one ally within line of sight who can clearly see you and hear you.</p>\n<p><strong>Flexible Confidence (Ex):</strong> Your resolve is more useful that others'. You can expend the uses of your confidence ability as uses of mythic power for the purposes of your marshal path abilities.</p>\n<p>You call your allies to make a coordinated charge at the same time. As an immediate action when you start a charge, you can expend one use of mythic power and allow an ally to charge immediately after your charge is complete. You can expend additional uses, allowing one more ally to charge per use spent. An ally's charge doesn't count toward the number of actions it can take on its next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Master of Mercy (Su):</strong> Your touch provides great relief. If you have the mercy class feature, when you lay on hands, you can expend one use of mythic power to apply all the mercies of your level or lower instead of just the mercies you've selected. If you don't have the mercy class feature, you can expend one use of mythic power as a standard action to remove a single condition from a creature you touch, using your tier as your paladin level to determine what mercies are available to you. You can select a different mercy each time you use this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Master of Shadows (Ex):</strong> You are a master of moving unseen and unheard, and adept at guiding others in quiet and undetected movement. When you or any ally within 30 feet attempts Stealth checks, each of you rolls twice and takes the higher result. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to add your tier to one ally's next Stealth check. The ally must be within 30 feet and the check must occur within the next minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic Bond (Ex):</strong> Your hunter's bond ability is more powerful than most. If your bond is with an animal, that animal gains half your favored enemy bonuses. If your hunter's bond is with your companions, you can activate the bond as a swift action, granting your allies your full favored enemy bonus instead of just half.</p>\n<p><strong>Shared Alertness (Ex):</strong> Your presence and guidance allow others to avoid traps and other dangers. Allies within 30 feet of you that can clearly see and hear you gain your trap sense ability. If you have evasion or improved evasion, you can expend one use of your mythic power as an immediate action to grant that ability to one ally within 30 feet until the beginning of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Shatter Resilience (Ex):</strong> You can channel your mythic power through your strike to lower your target's damage reduction. When you hit a creature that has DR, you can expend one use of mythic power as part of the attack to lower the target's DR by an amount equal to your tier (to a minimum of 0) for 1 minute. Multiple uses of this ability on the same creature don't stack.</p>\n<p><strong>Words of Hope (Su):</strong> As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to inspire allies within a 30-foot radius, granting each of them the ability to roll twice and take the higher result on one attack roll, saving throw, skill check, or ability check. An ally can use this ability once per round for a number of rounds equal to half your tier, and must choose whether to roll twice before rolling the die. This is a language-dependent emotion effect.</p>\n<p>Special Abilities</p>"}

When carried by a non-mythic creature, a nexus crystal bestows the ability to survive the conditions of a hostile plane as though the bearer were native to that plane. For example, the crystal would give immunity to the fires of the Plane of Fire and the life-draining radiation of the Negative Energy Plane. Any adaptation given protects only against the hazards of the plane itself, not the creatures within it - fire attacks from creatures on the Plane of Fire are still hazardous to the bearer.

If traveling to a location she's already visited, she can reduce the inaccuracy of plane shift by expending two uses of mythic power when she does so, in which case she appears 1d6-1 miles (minimum 0 miles) from her destination.</li>\n<li>As a standard action, the bearer can touch another creature with the nexus crystal and expend three uses of mythic power to use plane shift to move the target to a random plane (Reflex DC 27 negates).</li>\n<li>As a standard action, the bearer can expend two uses of mythic power to create a widened dimensional lock centered on the crystal instead of on a point in space. The lock lasts for 24 hours or until dismissed.</li>\n<li>As a full-round action, the bearer can attempt to draw back other creatures that teleported away by expending four uses of mythic power. If she succeeds at a DC 40 Knowledge (planes) check, the bearer can draw back up to one creature per mythic tier she possesses that departed via a conjuration (teleportation) effect in the previous round. To draw back a creature, the bearer must be within 15 feet of the location the creature left from. If the creature resists, it can attempt a Will save (DC 25 + the bearer's tier) to avoid returning. The bearer can choose freely which creatures from a group to pull back, and can even pull back creatures that departed with different means or to different destinations, as long as their points of departure are within range.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Destruction</h1>\n<p>A nexus crystal can be destroyed by invoking its plane shift power as the bearer steps through a gate. Doing so destroys the crystal and the gate, and the resulting magical explosion causes 18d10 points of damage to creatures within a 2-mile-radius burst of either side of the gate (Reflex DC 27 for half damage). Permanent gates between planes could potentially be destroyed in this fashion, at the GM's discretion.</p>"}
