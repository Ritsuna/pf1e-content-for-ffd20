Chapter 4: Spells And Rituals}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>First introduced in <em>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</em>, occult rituals allow any character to attempt magic at great risk. Just like those in <em>Occult Adventures</em>, characters can learn the following occult rituals only by discovering them in play.</p>\n<h1>Fugue Of Oblivion</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Enchantment (Compulsion); <strong>Level </strong>6</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>6 hours</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, F (a receptacle urn worth at least 1,000 gp per level to be stolen; see below), SC (up to 4)</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Checks </strong>Bluff DC 35, 3 successes; Heal DC 35, 3 successes</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./character level of the primary caster)</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one living creature</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>instantaneous; see text</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will negates; <strong>SR </strong>yes</p>\n<p><strong>Backlash </strong>The primary caster can't form short-term memories for the next 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure </strong>The primary caster must succeed at a Will save or suffer the effects of the amnesia greater madness (see page 182). The amnesia lasts until removed, but can't be removed, even by magic, until 2d6 days have passed.</p>\n<h2>EFFECT</h2>\n<p>The casters weave the target's name into a chant of nonsense rhyming stories for 6 hours, as they slowly extract the target's memories into the urn as a purple mist. The target loses all but the first class level she ever gained (if any; this ritual doesn't affect racial hit dice), immediately reducing or removing all level-dependent abilities as if the target were a 1st-level character. In addition to the loss of her class levels, the target suffers from total amnesia of the time in which she accrued those levels. The target can gain experience and accrue new levels, though she must adhere to all the same decisions she made previously with her missing levels (class, archetype, skills, feats, and so on), even if she can't explain why she now makes such decisions. In some cases, she might do so without meeting the requirements, such as if her amnesia blocked an alignment change and she gained levels in a class with an alignment restriction she no longer met; in this case, she would gain the abilities but retain only those she would have as an ex-member of the class. The rule that she must adhere to all previous decisions has one exception: if the target is a psychic, she can gain the amnesiac archetype (<em>Occult Adventures </em>104), as long as she could otherwise take it.</p>\n<p>Destroying the receptacle instantly returns the lost levels to the target and reverses any amnesia. If the target became an amnesiac psychic, she loses the archetype as normal.</p>\n<h1>The Hungering Of Shadows</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Evocation; <strong>Level </strong>9</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 day</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (<em>lavender and green ioun stone </em>split into 6 shards), F (an onyx throne worth at least 40,000 gp), SC (6)</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Checks </strong>Knowledge (arcana) DC 47, 4 successes; Knowledge (geography) DC 47, 2 successes; Knowledge (nature) 47, 1 success; Spellcraft DC 47, 2 successes</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>10 miles/character level of primary caster</p>\n<p><strong>Area </strong>1 mile radius/character level of primary caster</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>instantaneous; see text</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>none; <strong>SR </strong>no</p>\n<p><strong>Backlash </strong>The primary caster gains 2 permanent negative levels, and all secondary casters are permanently blinded and deafened. None of these effects can be removed by any means unless the ritual is reversed.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure </strong>The primary caster and all secondary casters are immediately transported to different locations on the Negative Energy Plane or Shadow Plane (50% for either plane, roll separately for each caster). The secondary casters remain catatonic for 1 hour upon arriving.</p>\n<h2>EFFECT</h2>\n<p>The primary caster sits upon the onyx throne, invoking ancient rites blaspheming against the light of the sun. The secondary casters offer up prayers to the gods of darkness. In turn, each of the secondary casters consumes one of the <em>ioun stone </em>shards, which induces a state of catatonia for 1 hour. Throughout the ritual's casting, a localized partial solar eclipse marks the location of the throne with an obvious pillar of darkness from above, easily noticed by creatures throughout the ritual's area.</p>\n<p>If the ritual is successful, the area is draped in a curtain of eternal darkness, removing sunlight from the area. Illumination in the area can never be brighter than dim light, and only a <em>miracle </em>or <em>wish </em>can even temporarily alleviate this restriction (though direct intervention of a deity can end the ritual's effect). Any light beyond dim light that would touch the area is instead transported into the <em>ioun stone </em>shards consumed by the secondary casters, making the secondary casters' entire bodies glow. Any object with a light spell having its light thus dimmed by the ritual counts as a part of the secondary casters' bodies for the purpose of a connection for spells like <em>scrying</em>. Collecting these <em>ioun stone </em>shards then piecing them back together while within the affected area ends the effects of this ritual.</p>\n<h1>Paired Suffering</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Necromancy; <strong>Level </strong>6</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>6 hours</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, F (an ornate ceremonial dagger worth at least 1,000 gp)</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Checks </strong>Knowledge (planes) DC 30, 2 successes; Knowledge (religion) DC 30, 4 successes</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>touch; see text</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>two creatures; see text</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>instantaneous; see text</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>none; <strong>SR </strong>no</p>\n<p><strong>Backlash </strong>The primary caster is staggered for the next 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure </strong>The primary caster is affected by <em>slay living </em>(using the ritual's save DC and caster level).</p>\n<h2>EFFECT</h2>\n<p>The caster prepares a ritual site no more than 100 feet long by 100 feet wide by 20 feet high, including sigils that prevent souls from escaping the perimeter. At the culmination of the ritual, the caster forces two spiritually close humanoid creatures experiencing a transitional state of their lives into ritual combat to the death. Among most humanoids, only teenage twins (fraternal or identical) young enough that they haven't gained a level in a PC class can be targets of this ritual; other pairings work only at the GM's discretion. One of the targets must slay the other with the ceremonial dagger focus for the ritual to succeed; even if all the checks succeed, if either target leaves the area while the other lives, or if someone else slays one of the targets, the ritual counts as a failure, and the primary caster suffers the failure effects.</p>\n<p>If the ritual succeeds, the soul of the creature slain by the ritual dagger is trapped within the ritual site. The surviving target has a choice either to allow the soul into her body, or to bar it from doing so. If the surviving target allows the soul inside her, she becomes a spiritualist, with the slain target as her phantom. If the surviving target chooses not to allow the spirit entry, it instead becomes an unfettered phantom(B5) and eventually a malevolent ghost, haunting the ritual site. This ghost cannot directly attack the surviving target, but in order to overcome its rejuvenation, someone must provide proof of the surviving target's death (false evidence is not sufficient; that target must actually be dead).</p>\n<h1>Second Sight</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Divination; <strong>Level </strong>4</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>40 minutes</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (an eyedropper filled with water from the Elemental Plane of Water), SC (at least 2, up to 6)</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Checks </strong>Heal DC 32, 1 success; Knowledge (arcana) DC 32, 1 success; Perception DC 32, 2 successes</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>long (400 ft. + 40 ft./character level of the primary caster)</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one living humanoid of the same size as the primary caster</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>10 minutes/character level of the primary caster</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will negates (harmless); <strong>SR </strong>no</p>\n<p><strong>Backlash </strong>The primary caster's movement speeds are all reduced by 15 feet, to a minimum of 5 feet, for the next 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure </strong>The target and primary caster have their vision permanently reversed, so the primary caster sees only what the target sees and vice versa. This effect can be removed only by <em>greater restoration</em>, <em>limited wish</em>, <em>miracle</em>, or <em>wish</em>.</p>\n<h2>EFFECT</h2>\n<p>The primary caster carefully applies specially prepared water to the target's eyes. Following this application, one or more secondary casters paint the primary caster's closed eyes, creating lifelike eyes overtop of the closed eyelids.</p>\n<p>When the primary caster's eyes are closed, she sees through the eyes of the target. This vision only works while the target is within range of the primary caster, and only if the ritual is successful. While seeing through the target's eyes, the primary caster is susceptible to gaze attacks, patterns, and other sight-based and visual attacks as if she were the target.</p>\n<h1>Horror and Ritual Failures</h1>\n<p>The rules in <em>Occult Adventures </em>are extremely lenient on how many skill checks a caster of an occult ritual can fail and still succeed. In a game where horror and tension are paramount, GMs may consider making it so that each failure on a skill check results in a weaker final effect or detrimental side effect. A simpler, more suspenseful solution is to have an occult ritual fail if a caster fails one skill check, regardless of how many checks the ritual requires.</p>\n<h1>Seeded Doom</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Transmutation [Evil]; <strong>Level </strong>8</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>8 hours</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (internal organs of an aberration), F (the crystallized brain of an aberration worth at least 7,500 gp and a book, painting, or section of sheet music), SC (up to 12)</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Checks </strong>Knowledge (arcana or history) DC 37, 2 successes; Knowledge (planes or religion) DC 37, 2 successes; Spellcraft DC 37, 4 successes</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 character levels of the primary caster)</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one object</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>instantaneous; see text</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>see text; <strong>SR </strong>see text</p>\n<p><strong>Backlash </strong>The primary caster is reduced to -1 hit point and is exhausted, and all secondary casters are exhausted.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure </strong>The ritual fails to affect the object, and all casters are afflicted by the seed's effect with no saving throw.</p>\n<h2>EFFECT</h2>\n<p>The casters grind the organs into paste and use it to paint their lips and tongue. Anointed by madness, they chant profane blasphemies into the focus brain, causing it to throb and glow. The primary caster releases this energy as a foul sludge, which trickles onto the other focus before seeping into the paper or paint. A successful ritual corrupts the targeted piece of art, planting a metaphysical seed into it, which propagates itself into any copies of the work later created based on the corrupted original; this includes book copies or matched painting duplicates, but not art, literature, or music that is merely derivative. A living creature subjected to the seeded piece of art, typically by hearing or seeing it, must succeed at a Will save or be afflicted by the seed (SR applies).</p>\n<p>By default, the seed causes <em>insanity </em>or a madness (see page 182), but numerous types of seeds exist, from different variants on this ritual with slightly different components, foci, and ritual DC. A few examples include becoming blind or deaf, contracting a disease, or rising as a zombie after death.</p>"}

Only the medium of wax can so closely duplicate the transparency of skin. Often, creators use powerful magic to house an animating spirit within the wax model. A created waxwork creature obeys the commands of its creator. Rarely, a wax sculpture animates of its own accord-the result of nearby magic suffusing the wax or a lost spirit in search of a corporeal form. Such waxwork creatures are uncontrolled.</p>\n<p>A waxwork creature is the same size as the creature it duplicates, but weighs only half as much.</p>\n<h1>CREATING A WAXWORK</h1>\n<p>\"Waxwork\" is an inherited template that can be added to any Tiny or larger corporeal creature (other than a construct or ooze), referred to hereafter as the base creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Rating</strong>: Depends on Hit Dice, as follows.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Waxwork HD</strong></td>\n<td><strong>CR</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2-3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4-5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6-7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8-10</td>\n<td>6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11-13</td>\n<td>7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14-16</td>\n<td>8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17-19</td>\n<td>9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If the creature is larger or smaller than Medium, adjust the CR according to the table below.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Waxwork Size</strong></td>\n<td><strong>CR</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tiny or smaller</td>\n<td>-2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Small</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Colossal</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Always neutral.</p>\n<p><strong>Type</strong>: The creature's type changes to construct. It doesn't retain any subtypes, nor does it gain the augmented subtype. It uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class</strong>: The waxwork creature's natural armor bonus is based on its size.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Waxwork Size</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Natural Armor Bonus</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tiny or smaller</td>\n<td>+0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Small</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>+7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Colossal</td>\n<td>+11</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice</strong>: Remove HD gained from class levels and change racial HD to d10s. Creatures without racial HD are treated as if they have 1 racial HD. As constructs, waxwork creatures gain additional hit points as noted in the following table.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Waxwork Size</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Bonus Hit Points</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tiny or smaller</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Small</td>\n<td>+10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>+20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>+30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>+40</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>+60</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Colossal</td>\n<td>+80</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Saves</strong>: The creature's base save bonuses are Fortitude +1/3 HD, Reflex +1/3 HD, and Will +1/3 HD.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities</strong>: A waxwork creature loses the base creature's defensive abilities. It gains waxen regeneration 5 (fire) and immunity to cold. If it has 11 or more HD, the waxen regeneration increases to 10 (fire). It also gains all of the standard immunities and traits possessed by constructs.</p>\n<p><em>Waxen Regeneration (Su)</em>: This ability functions like regeneration, except the waxwork creature has it without a Constitution score. A waxwork creature reduced to 0 hit points is staggered instead of destroyed while its waxen regeneration is active; it ignores all damage dealt to it that would reduce its hit points below 0. Fire damage causes the waxwork creature's regeneration to stop functioning on the round following the attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: A waxwork creature is vulnerable to fire.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong>: A waxwork creature retains movement types, except as follows: It loses burrow and magical flight speeds. Winged waxwork creatures can fly, but maneuverability drops to clumsy. A waxwork creature floats and must succeed at a DC 20 Swim check each round to stay underwater.</p>\n<p><strong>Attacks</strong>: A waxwork creature retains all the natural weapons and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. It also gains a slam attack that deals damage based on the waxwork creature's size, but as if it were one size category larger than its actual size.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks</strong>: A waxwork creature retains none of the base creature's special attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Abilities</strong>: A waxwork creature has no Constitution or Intelligence score, and its Wisdom and Charisma scores change to 10.</p>\n<p><strong>BAB</strong>: A waxwork creature's base attack bonus is equal to its Hit Dice.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills</strong>: A waxwork creature loses all of the base creature's skills and gains none of its own.</p>\n<p><strong>Feats</strong>: A waxwork creature loses all of the base creature's feats and gains Improved Initiative as a bonus feat.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Qualities</strong>: A waxwork creature loses most special qualities of the base creature. It retains any extraordinary special qualities that improve its melee or ranged attacks. A waxwork creature gains the freeze universal monster ability to appear as a wax sculpture.</p>\n<h1>VARIANT WAXWORKS</h1>\n<p>The following variants alter the waxwork creature template.</p>\n<h1>Sentient Waxwork</h1>\n<p>Rarely, waxworks shaped like intelligent creatures develop minds of their own and can gain levels in character classes.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Rating</strong>: Same as a normal waxwork creature's CR.</p>\n<p><strong>Abilities</strong>: A sentient waxwork creature has an Intelligence score of 3d6.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills</strong>: A sentient waxwork creature gains skill points based on its Hit Dice and Intelligence. Disguise and Stealth are class skills for it, but it has no other class skills. If it was crafted to resemble a specific individual, it also gains a +10 racial bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate that individual.</p>\n<p><strong>Feats</strong>: A sentient waxwork gains retroactive feats based on its Hit Dice.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong>: A sentient waxwork creature speaks Common (or the language of the sculptor or animating spirit).</p>\n<h1>Waxwork Candle</h1>\n<p>One or more small flames burn on wicks emerging from the waxwork creature's body, often its head or hands. Though real, these flames don't consume the waxwork creature's body.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Rating</strong>: Normal waxwork creature's CR + 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Melee Attacks</strong>: The waxwork creature's slam attack, or one natural attack it has, gains the burn universal monster ability. The additional fire damage is equal to the waxwork creature's slam damage die. The waxwork creature gains a +2 racial bonus to the save DC.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Qualities</strong>: A waxwork candle creature gains illumination.</p>\n<p><em>Illumination (Su)</em>: A waxwork candle creature's flames create normal light within the creature's reach and increases the light level by one step within twice that distance (minimum 5 feet). A waxwork candle creature is immune to its own fire, but not other flames (including those ignited by its own fire). The waxwork candle creature's flames can be extinguished as normal flames. It loses the burn ability when the wicks are unlit, but can magically reignite the flames as a move action.</p>\n<p><strong>Construction</strong>: Add <em>produce flame </em>as a spell requirement. Add 1,000 gp to the price (and 500 gp to the cost).</p>\n<h1>WAXWORK CREATURE</h1>\n<p><strong>PRICE </strong>1,000 gp per HD plus cost of wax</p>\n<p><strong><strong>CL</strong> </strong>varies (equal to the waxwork creature's HD)</p>\n<p>CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p><strong>COST </strong>500 gp per HD plus cost of wax</p>\n<p>Craft Construct, <em>animate objects</em>, <em>make whole</em>; <strong>Skill </strong>Craft (sculpture);</p>\n<p>^Bestiary Horrific Inspirations</p>"}
{"_id":"1Kt8d9tO305BO0LW","name":"2.03. Druid","permission":{"default":0,"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR":3},"folder":"","flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_vh83dbmaz5j","path":"Horror Adventures#/CF_SEP/2. Chapter 2: Archetypes and Class Options","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<p>@Compendium[pf-content.horror-adventures.jsEW1pMN3Ds5FXmw]{(Index) Horror Adventures}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.horror-adventures.qet8A89j9mn1czfm]{2.0. Chapter 2: Archetypes And Class Options}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The natural world is full of beauty, but it is equally a realm of horror, savagery, and death. Some druids call these darker places of nature home. They tend to wayward spirits and venerate the cycle of life and death, as well as seek to control that cycle themselves through baleful sacrifices, taking life to give new life.</p>\n<h1>Death Druid (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Some druids believe that birth and death are the most important parts of the natural cycle. They focus on destroying undead and putting troubled souls to rest.</p>\n<p><strong>Phantom</strong>: A death druid attracts phantoms like a spiritualist (<em>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures </em>72), though she focuses her efforts on putting those phantoms to rest. A death druid is continually attempting to figure out how to send her phantom to the afterlife (usually by completing the phantom's unfinished business as determined by the GM). If she is able to do so, she gains a new phantom with no additional effort on her part, sometime during the next week.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, she gains the spiritualist's phantom and etheric tether class features; at 4th level, she gains the bonded manifestation class feature; and at 14th level, she gains the spiritual bond class feature. She does not gain any of the other spiritualist abilities related to phantoms. The death druid treats her druid level as her spiritualist level for these abilities.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces nature bond and wild shape.</p>\n<p><strong>Soul Magic</strong>: A death druid adds the following spells to her druid spell list at the given spell levels: 0-<em>grave words</em>(OA); 1st-<em>sanctify corpse</em>(UM); 2nd-<em>calm spirit</em>(OA), <em>false life</em>, <em>ghostbane dirge</em>(APG), <em>spiritual weapon</em>; 3rd-<em>speak with dead</em>; 4th-<em>speak with haunt</em>(ACG),<em>spiritual ally</em>(APG); 5th-<em>breath of life</em>, <em>call spirit</em>(OA),<em> mass ghostbane dirge</em>(APG); 6th-<em>circle of death</em>, <em>undeath to death</em>.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces nature sense and wild empathy.</p>\n<p><strong>Resist Death's Call (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, a death druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against death effects, negative energy, and energy drain.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces resist nature's lure.</p>\n<p><strong>Negative Immunity (Su)</strong>: At 9th level, a death druid is immune to negative energy and energy drain.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>\n<h1>Devolutionist (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Full of simmering hatred toward civilization and those who dwell within it, devolutionists believe that the world would be better off without any sentient life at all. They transform intelligent creatures and domesticated animals into throwbacks to their feral ancestors.</p>\n<p><strong>Devolved Companion (Ex)</strong>: A devolutionist must choose a devolved humanoid as an animal companion for her nature bond. Use the stats for an ape animal companion, but at 4th level, the devolved humanoid doesn't increase to size Large (it still gains all the other benefits at 4th level).</p>\n<p>This ability alters nature bond.</p>\n<p><strong>Undomesticate (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, a devolutionist can spend 1 minute with a willing or restrained domesticated animal to undo the effects of domestication, transforming it into a wild animal and causing it to lose any tricks it knew. The animal no longer recognizes any humanoids as friends or allies and gladly tears former playmates apart for food. Handle Animal checks don't work on an undomesticated creature, though wild empathy does. This ability doesn't function on animal companions, special mounts, or the like, and other exceptional domesticated animals can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the devolutionist's druid level + her Wisdom modifier) to negate the effect and become immune to it for 24 hours. Though this ability is instantaneous, <em>break enchantment</em>, <em>limited wish</em>, <em>miracle</em>, or <em>wish </em>can reverse the effects.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces resist nature's lure.</p>\n<p><strong>Devolution (Sp)</strong>: At 9th level, a devolutionist can perform a 24-hour ritual to irrevocably transform a humanoid or animal into a devolved feral state. There is no saving throw, but the target must be present and stay relatively still for the entire ritual, which typically requires a willing or restrained target.</p>\n<p>An affected humanoid's Intelligence score is instantly reduced to 2; its type changes to animal; it loses all spellcasting and abilities that require intelligence; it can't wield manufactured weapons; it gains two claw attacks and a bite attack (all dealing 1d4 points of damage for a Medium humanoid or 1d3 for Small humanoids); and it can't use skills other than Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Fly, Intimidate, Perception, Stealth, Survival, and Swim.</p>\n<p>An affected animal is undomesticated (see above) if applicable and then either gains the advanced template, except without any increases to mental ability scores, or becomes a dire version of the animal (if a dire version exists and at the GM's discretion). The devolved creature starts out friendly toward the devolutionist, though it typically tries to kill and devour other sentient humanoids. The devolutionist has no special empathy or connection with a creature she devolves, and if it was her animal companion before, it ceases to be so. The druid can communicate her desires to a devolved creature using wild empathy. This ability counters and dispels <em>awaken</em>, and only <em>awaken</em>, <em>miracle</em>, or <em>wish </em>can reverse it.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>\n<h1>Life Channeler (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Life channelers take the natural cycle to what they believe is its logical conclusion. By sacrificing the life of a sentient creature, they can generate energy that guarantees fertility and prosperity for lower creatures like plants and animals. These druids preach to flocks who become willing sacrifices, each serving as a \"king\" or \"queen\" for a short time after being chosen as the next sacrifice.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: In addition to a druid's usual alignment requirements, a life channeler must be of a nongood alignment. If she becomes good, she can no longer take levels in the druid class or fill her wicker talismans (see below), but she otherwise keeps all her abilities.</p>\n<p>This alters the druid's alignment requirements.</p>\n<p><strong>Plant Preservation (Su)</strong>: A life channeler must choose the Plant domain with her nature bond (she can select the Growth subdomain if she wishes). When she performs a coup de grace that kills a sentient humanoid creature (not a summoned creature), she can do so ritualistically in order to affect the area centered on the body with the enrichment version of <em>plant growth</em>. The sacrifice is a death effect.</p>\n<p>This ability alters nature bond.</p>\n<p><strong>Wicker Talismans (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, a life channeler gains a selection of wicker talismans that can store and convert the life energy of sentient creatures into the growth, health, and fertility of plants around her. The life channeler gains one wicker talisman corresponding to each level of druid spells she can cast, starting with 1st-level spells. These talismans are initially empty, but can hold life energy. When the life channeler ritualistically kills a creature with a coup de grace, she can store life energy in a talisman instead of gaining the <em>plant growth </em>effect. The creature must be of a CR equal to at least twice the spell level of the corresponding talisman. For instance, a CR 8 creature's life energy could provide energy for a talisman holding up to a 4th-level spell. A talisman is either full or empty; it can't hold more than one creature's life energy. A life channeler can expend the energy stored in a talisman to cast her domain spell of the talisman's level without expending a spell slot.</p>\n<p>Starting at 6th level, a life channeler gathers a flock of willing sacrifices. This grants her the benefits of the Leadership feat, except that using a follower as a human sacrifice with this ability doesn't cause the life channeler to take a penalty to her Leadership score.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces wild shape.</p>\n<p><strong>Rampant Growth</strong>: At 4th level, a life channeler can enrich the land more than usual with her sacrifices. When ritually killing a creature with a coup de grace for the <em>plant growth </em>enrichment effect or casting <em>plant growth </em>for the enrichment effect from one of her talismans, the effect has a range of 1 mile instead of a range of half a mile. At 8th level, if the sacrificed creature was at least CR 8, the effect lasts for 3 years instead of 1 year. At 12th level, if the sacrificed creature was at least CR 12, the effect increases productivity to two-thirds above normal, instead of one-third above normal. These effects stack, assuming the creature is high enough CR.</p>\n<p><strong>Stored Life</strong>: At 9th level, a life channeler gains a third option when using a coup de grace on a sentient humanoid. If the victim had a CR at least as high as the life channeler's class level, the life channeler can store the creature's life energy in her body. She can have the life energy from only 1 creature in her body at a time. While she is storing life energy, if she would take damage or die from a death effect or if she would gain negative levels or take energy drain, she can sacrifice the stored energy to negate the effect without spending an action.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>\n<p>^Archetypes and Class Options Feats</p>"}

Chapter 2: Archetypes And Class Options}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Slayers are killers by trade but are rarely random or wanton in plying it. In the midst of horrors that drive others beyond rationality, slayers remain calm, considerate, and cunning.</p>\n<h1>Bloody Jake (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Bloody jakes are cruel backwoods folk who prey upon their country cousins while terrorizing civilized people who venture into their rural range.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: A bloody jake must be of an evil alignment. A bloody jake who becomes nonevil cannot gain new levels as a slayer but retains all his class abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Terrain (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, a bloody jake can select a type of terrain from the favored terrain table for rangers (<em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook </em>65), though he is restricted to cold, desert, forest, jungle, mountains, plains, and swamp. His bonuses when in this terrain increase by 2 at 5th level and every 5 slayer levels thereafter, though he does not gain the ability to select additional favored terrains unless he takes the terrain mastery(UC) rogue talent.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces the slayer's proficiency in medium armor and shields.</p>\n<p><strong>Cruel Tricks</strong>: Bloody jakes use backwoods folk magic to confuse, terrify, and weaken their prey. A bloody jake can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his slayer level + his Charisma modifier. He gains the cruel tricks below at the indicated slayer levels.</p>\n<p><em>Distant Voices (Sp)</em>: At 1st level, a bloody jake can cause his voice to seem to emanate from somewhere else, as per ventriloquism. This ability doesn't take any other action to activate and can be used as part of speaking (as a free action); it costs one use of cruel tricks to affect his speech for 1 round.</p>\n<p><em>Lose Your Way (Sp)</em>: At 4th level, as a standard action, a bloody jake can spend one use of cruel tricks to cause a creature that is within 30 feet and within the bloody jake's favored terrain to become disoriented, taking a penalty on Survival checks equal to the bloody jake's slayer level and a -2 penalty on saving throws against fear and illusions. This effect lasts for 1 hour per slayer level of the bloody jake or for as long as the affected creature remains within the bloody jake's favored terrain, whichever is shorter.</p>\n<p><em>Something's Not Right (Su)</em>: At 8th level, as a move action, a bloody jake can spend one use of cruel tricks to cause all foes within 30 feet to become shaken for 1 round. This is a fear effect that doesn't increase in strength by applying other effects that cause creatures to become shaken. At 12th level, he can use this ability as a swift action. At 16th level, a bloody jake can make any number of the affected foes frightened for 1 round, though such foes receive a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the bloody jake's slayer level + his Charisma modifier) to negate the frightened condition; even so, such a foe is still shaken.</p>\n<p><em>The Woods Have Eyes (Sp)</em>: At 12th level, a bloody jake in his favored terrain can spend one use of cruel tricks as a swift action to gain blindsense in a 30-foot radius for 1 round; this blindsense is sound-based.</p>\n<p>This replaces the 1st-level studied target and the slayer talents gained at 4th, 8th, 12th, and 16th level.</p>\n<p><strong>Poor Study (Ex)</strong>: A bloody jake gains this ability at 5th level rather than 1st level, beginning with a bonus of +1 at 5th level and increasing by 1 for every 5 slayer levels thereafter. A bloody jake must be 11th level to study an opponent as a move or swift action.</p>\n<p>This ability alters studied target.</p>\n<p><strong>Sadistic Snare (Ex)</strong>: At 6th level, a bloody jake gains Learn Ranger Trap(UM) as a bonus feat, benefiting from it as if he were a ranger. He can expend two uses of his traps ability to add his sneak attack damage to the trap's damage; any slayer talents or rogue talents he has that modify sneak attack damage, such as bleeding attack, also apply to sneak attack damage dealt by his ranger traps.</p>\n<p>This replaces the slayer talent gained at 6th level.</p>\n<p><strong>Cruel Trick (Ex)</strong>: At 11th level, a bloody jake can maim or humiliate his target with a sneak attack, substituting 1 point of Dexterity or Charisma damage per die of sneak attack damage forfeited. A successful Will save negates this ability damage (DC = 10 + 1/2 the bloody jake's slayer level + his Charisma modifier).</p>\n<p>This ability replaces swift tracker.</p>\n<p><strong>Woodland Shortcut (Sp)</strong>: At 13th level, a bloody jake can move with supernatural ease among the trees once per day, as if using <em>tree stride </em>with a caster level equal to his slayer level.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces slayer's advance.</p>\n<h1>Family Hunter (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Most slayers focus their efforts on single targets, but family hunters try to root out every branch of a tainted tree of life.</p>\n<p><strong>Find Family (Sp)</strong>: At 2nd level, a family hunter chooses a particular family line of mortal creatures to cleanse (she must choose an actual family line like \"The Montrose family,\" rather than something generic that would cover all creatures of a given kind like \"All humans descended from the first human created by the gods\"). She can target any creature from that family line with <em>discern next of kin</em>(ACG) (with a caster level equal to her slayer level) at will as a spell-like ability. The save DC is Charisma-based and is modified by the slayer's studied target bonus if the creature is also her studied target. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to this ability for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>If the family hunter's chosen family line is completely eradicated, she can choose a new one after 1 month of studying.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 2nd level.</p>\n<p><strong>Kinslayer (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a family hunter's sneak attack deals an additional 1d6 points of damage to any creature with a blood relation to the family line she seeks to cleanse.</p>\n<p>This ability alters sneak attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Studied Target (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level and above, a slayer can maintain more than one studied target at a time only if all targets are closely related to one another (even if they aren't part of the family line she seeks to cleanse). This includes blood relatives; undead spawn; constructs or undead and their creator; summoned creatures and their summoner; creatures that are charmed, dominated, or otherwise under direct magical control and their controller; and cohorts, followers, animal companions, familiars, and similar associates of one master.</p>\n<p>This ability alters studied target.</p>\n<p><strong>Disrupt Teamwork (Ex)</strong>: At 6th level, a family hunter's studied target never counts as an ally to its allies for the purpose of flanking the family hunter or using teamwork feats or the aid another action against the family hunter.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 6th level.</p>\n<h1>Witch Killer (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Born into cultures where magic users are hated and feared, witch killers devote their lives to purge the arcane taint from the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Class Skills</strong>: A witch killer adds Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft to his list of class skills.</p>\n<p>This alters the slayer's class skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Studied Witch (Ex)</strong>: A witch killer's studied combat bonus applies on Spellcraft checks and saving throws against arcane spells and spell-like abilities and hexes. This bonus is reduced by 1 (minimum 0) if the target is not an arcane spellcaster, or a being called or summoned by arcane magic. He does not gain the increases to the maximum number of studied targets he can have at a time normally attained at 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, but his bonuses still increase at those levels.</p>\n<p>This ability alters studied target.</p>\n<p><strong>Superstitious (Ex)</strong>: Instead of being able to select ranger combat style feats as slayer talents, a witch killer can select any of the following barbarian rage powers as slayer talents, treating his slayer level as his barbarian level: clear mind, disruptive(APG), eater of magic(UC), spell sunder(UC), spellbreaker(APG), sunder enchantment(UC), superstition, or witch hunter(APG). If the witch killer selects a rage power that can normally be used only once per rage (eater of magic, spell sunder, or sunder enchantment), he can use it once per day per 5 slayer levels he possesses, though no more than once per round in any event. The other rage powers affect the slayer constantly, though the superstition and witch hunter rage powers apply only against arcane spells and spell-like abilities and the creatures that use them.</p>\n<p><strong>Lingering Thrust (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, when a witch killer's attack against an arcane spellcaster in the midst of casting forces the spellcaster to attempt a concentration check, the witch killer adds half his slayer level to the check's DC. When he makes a sneak attack against an arcane spellcaster, up to 1 point of sneak attack damage per slayer level counts as ongoing damage for the purpose of forcing the spellcaster to attempt concentration checks (the witch killer does not add half his slayer level to this DC).</p>\n<p>This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 4th level.</p>\n<p><strong>Scent Magic (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, a witch killer can detect arcane magic by scent. He can use <em>detect magic </em>at will (as per a paladin's ability to detect evil), but only against arcane magic, and the ability is scent-based and thus defeated by effects like <em>negate aroma</em>(APG). Even when he isn't concentrating on using his magic scent, when a creature within scent range casts an arcane spell (including arcane spell-like abilities or magic item effects), the witch killer automatically pinpoints the caster's location.</p>\n<p><strong>Burn the Witch (Sp)</strong>: At 10th level, once per day when a witch killer observes a creature within 30 feet cast an arcane spell or use an arcane spell-like ability, he can use <em>foster hatred</em>(OA) on that character, or target one creature harmed by the arcane effect with <em>vengeful outrage</em>(UM), identifying the caster as the enemy. He can use this ability twice per day at 15th level, and he can use this ability three times per day at 20th level. The save DC is Charisma-based and uses the witch killer's slayer level as his caster level.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces the slayer talent normally gained at 10th level.</p>\n<p>^Archetypes and Class Options Feats</p>"}

Chapter 4: Spells And Rituals}</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Absurdity</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Illusion (Phantasm) [Emotion(UM), Mind-Affecting]; <strong>Level </strong>Bard 2, Medium 2, Mesmerist 2, Psychic 2, Spiritualist 2</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>up to one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 minute/level (D)</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>no</p>\n<p>Your targets perceive intimidation and threats as laughably absurd. A character attempting to intimidate your targets is instead perceived as having exaggerated facial features or babbling and awkward speech. Effects that impose fear conditions become objects of ridicule, with the targets making fun of the source of the object as it attempts to scare them.</p>\n<p><em>Absurdity </em>protects your targets from gaining lesser fear conditions (spooked, shaken, and scared), granting them immunity to spooked and a 50% chance to negate shaken or scared conditions instead of gaining them from any effect, including uses of the Intimidate skill to demoralize. Any other effect related to a spell or ability that generates fear (such as dying from a <em>phantasmal killer</em>) affects them normally, and effects that ignore immunity to fear also ignore <em>absurdity</em>.</p>\n<p>However, target creatures also have serious difficulty noticing potential threats; they take a -10 penalty on Sense Motive checks to avoid surprise or to notice that a creature is actively threatening or malicious and a -2 penalty on initiative checks. The spell doesn't prevent spells or effects that provide early warning or a form of danger sense (like <em>anticipate peril</em>(UM) or <em>find traps</em>) from alerting the affected character to danger.</p>\n<h1>Alleviate Corruption</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Abjuration; <strong>Level </strong>Cleric 6, Psychic 6, Shaman 6, Spiritualist 6, Witch 6</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 minute</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (rare herbs, incense, and jewels worth 500 gp/the target's character level or HD)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>touch</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one creature other than yourself</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>instantaneous</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will negates (harmless); <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes (harmless)</p>\n<p>You combat the rising corruption (see page 14) in another creature or advance the long-term process of exorcising it entirely. This spell has two purposes, and you choose which application to use at the time of casting.</p>\n<p><em>Combat Corruption</em>: Each time a creature fails a saving throw to prevent its corruption from progressing (as described in that corruption's Progression section), it advances to the next corruption stage-at stage 3, it loses the battle against its corruption. Using this spell can lower the target's corruption stage by 1. This has no effect if the target isn't at progression stage of 1 or higher.</p>\n<p><em>Remove Corruption</em>: You can remove 1 manifestation level from the target creature, as well as the most recently acquired manifestation and its corresponding gift and stain. Doing this also reduces the power of gifts and stains that vary based upon manifestation level. This application of <em>alleviate corruption </em>doesn't reduce the target's corruption stage. If the target creature loses all manifestation levels, it is cured of the corruption.</p>\n<p>Either application of the spell requires a caster level check. The DC is equal to 10 + double the target's manifestation level + 3 times the target's corruption stage (effectively 0, 3, or 6, since stage 3 removes the character from player control).</p>\n<p>Tampering with corruptions is dangerous, as their nature is contagious. If you fail this caster level check by 5 or more, you contract the corruption and gain a manifestation (the rules for the useful and vile corruption variants still apply). A roll of natural 1 on the caster level check is an automatic failure. If you already have the same corruption, you must instead attempt an immediate saving throw against it. Casting <em>alleviate corruption </em>on yourself automatically fails, as does casting it on a target who has fully succumbed to a corruption (failed three saving throws against it). A creature can be the beneficiary of this spell only once per week, whether it succeeds or not.</p>\n<h1>Appearance Of Life</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Illusion (Glamer) [Evil]; <strong>Level </strong>Cleric 3, Medium 2, Mesmerist 3, Psychic 3, Sorcerer/Wizard 3, Spiritualist 3, Witch 3</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 round</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (one Tiny or larger living creature)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>long (400 ft. + 40 ft./caster level)</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one or more undead creatures</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>10 minutes/level (D)</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will disbelief or Will negates (see text); <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>no</p>\n<p>The illusion makes undead creatures of Medium size or smaller appear as if they were living humanoid creatures. You can target a number of undead creatures whose total number of Hit Dice is no greater than twice your caster level. When you create the illusion, you choose the races, genders, and attire for the undead creatures. Additionally, the illusion makes the undead creatures' movements appear lifelike (two shuffling zombies could be made to appear as two strolling lovers). The illusion doesn't create smell, sound, texture, or temperature. Undead with Intelligence scores can attempt a saving throw to negate the effect of the spell, but mindless undead do not. Any creatures interacting with the illusion receive a saving throw to disbelieve the illusion.</p>\n<p>The illusion interferes with <em>detect undead</em>, requiring the caster to succeed at a caster check (DC = 11 + your caster level) for the spell to determine the creatures are undead.</p>\n<p><em>Appearance of life </em>can be made permanent with a <em>permanency </em>spell by a caster of 12th level or higher for the cost of 10,000 gp.</p>\n<h1>Assume Appearance</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Transmutation (Polymorph); <strong>Level </strong>Alchemist 3, Bard 3, Medium 3, Mesmerist 3, Occultist 3, Psychic 3, Shaman 3, Sorcerer/Wizard 3, Spiritualist 3, Summoner 3, Witch 3</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 minute</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S,F (corpse of the deceased creature whose form you plan to assume)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>personal</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>you</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 day/level (D)</p>\n<p>This spell functions similarly to <em>alter self</em>, except for the following differences. You assume the exact form of a deceased Small or Medium creature of the humanoid type. Your voice changes to match that of the form you assume. The creature whose form you assume must be dead and you must have access to its fresh corpse (either dead less than 24 hours, or preserved via <em>gentle repose </em>or similar effect). Any attempt to copy the form of a living creature causes the spell to fail. You do not have access to the assumed form's abilities, memories, mannerisms, or speech patterns. The spell grants a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to appear as the imitated creature.</p>\n<p>If the assumed creature is returned to life while this spell is active, <em>assume appearance </em>immediately ends.</p>\n<h1>Assume Appearance, Greater</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Transmutation (Polymorph); <strong>Level </strong>Alchemist 4, Bard 4, Medium 4, Mesmerist 4, Occultist 4, Psychic 4, Shaman 4, Sorcerer/Wizard 4, Spiritualist 4, Summoner 4, Witch 4</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, F(corpse or likeness of the deceased creature whose form you plan to assume)</p>\n<p>This spell functions similar to <em>assume appearance</em>, except that you can imitate a creature even if you have only a likeness (such as a sketch or painting) that is fairly accurate. If there is an age difference between the likeness and the actual creature, you take on the appearance of the creature near the end of its life. If you have heard the creature whose form you plan to assume speak aloud, you can also copy its voice as <em>vocal alteration</em>(UM) (<em>speak with dead </em>can also be used to fulfill this requirement). The spell doesn't grant insight into the dead creature's mannerisms.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if a likeness used as a focus for the spell is kept on your person or within 30 feet at all times, the aura of <em>greater assume appearance </em>is redirected to the likeness instead of to you, similar to a reverse application of the <em>misdirection </em>spell.</p>\n<h1>Ban Corruption</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Abjuration [Good]; <strong>Level </strong>Cleric 5, Inquisitor 4, Medium 3, Occultist 4, Paladin 4, Shaman 5</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, F (a ceremonial dagger)</p>\n<p><strong>Area </strong>30-ft.-radius emanation centered on you</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>concentration plus 1 round/level, up to 1 hour/level</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>You strip all creatures within the emanation of any gifts associated with corruptions (see page 14). Abilities associated with corruptions cease to function, as if they were magically dispelled. The corruption stains still fully affect creatures. A creature that enters the emanation and fails its saving throw loses its gifts until the spell's duration ends, even if it leaves the emanation, but a successful saving throw renders a creature immune to the spell, even if it enters and exits the emanation several times.</p>\n<h1>Barbed Chains</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Conjuration (Summoning) [Emotion(Um), Fear, Mind-Affecting]; <strong>Level </strong>Antipaladin 1, Bloodrager 1, Cleric 1, Inquisitor 1, Occultist 1, Shaman 1, Summoner 1</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (a length of chain doused with fresh blood)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level)</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>a chain sharpened at one end</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>instantaneous</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will partial (see text); <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>no</p>\n<p>You summon a chain from another realm, causing it to burst out from the ground and strike a target within the spell's range. You can have the chain either make a melee attack (dealing 1d6 points of slashing damage) or attempt a trip combat maneuver against the target.</p>\n<p>The chain uses your base attack bonus plus your key spellcasting ability score modifier as its attack bonus and combat maneuver bonus. On a successful hit or combat maneuver check, the target must attempt a Will save. If it fails its save, the creature is shaken for 1d4 rounds. You summon one additional chain every 3 levels after 1st, for a total of two chains at 4th level, three at 7th level, and a maximum of four at 10th level. Multiple chains can attack the same target but the shaken effect doesn't stack.</p>\n<h1>Evil Spells</h1>\n<p>This section includes a large number of evil spells. Casting an evil spell is an evil act, but for most characters simply casting such a spell once isn't enough to change her alignment; this only occurs if the spell is used for a truly abhorrent act, or if the caster established a pattern of casting evil spells over a long period. A wizard who uses <em>animate dead </em>to create guardians for defenseless people won't turn evil, but he will if he does it over and over again. The GM decides whether the character's alignment changes, but typically casting two evil spells is enough to turn a good creature nongood, and three or more evils spells move the caster from nongood to evil. The greater the amount of time between castings, the less likely alignment will change. Some spells require sacrificing a sentient creature, a major evil act that makes the caster evil in almost every circumstance.</p>\n<p>Those who are forbidden from casting spells with an opposed alignment might lose their divine abilities if they circumvent that restriction (via Use Magic Device, for example), depending on how strict their deities are.</p>\n<p>Though this advice talks about evil spells, it also applies to spells with other alignment descriptors.</p>\n<h1>Blood Ties</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Necromancy [Evil]; <strong>Level </strong>Antipaladin 4, Cleric 5, Druid 5, Inquisitor 5, Psychic 5, Shaman 5, Witch 5</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, F (a small length of crimson string)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>unlimited (see text)</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>two living creatures</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 day/level (D)</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will negates (see text); <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>no</p>\n<p>One of the targets of this spell must be a hostage-a bound, pinned, or helpless creature within your reach (though the spell doesn't end if the hostage later moves beyond your reach). The second target must be a member of the first target's family. If neither creature successfully saves against the spell, the second target also takes any damage conferred to the hostage, provided both are still alive, to a maximum of 10 points of damage per caster level per day (damage beyond that necessary to kill the first target does not transfer). This transferred damage is typeless and ignores the second creature's damage reduction and resistances. If either target succeeds at the saving throw, you can never attempt to exploit the connection between these particular two creatures again. The connection between your targets weakens when the two are less familiar with one another. Each target gains a +2 bonus on its save if the two are distant relations or related by marriage. Each target takes a -2 penalty on its save if the two targets are parent and child or siblings.</p>\n<h1>Bloodbath</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Necromancy; <strong>Level </strong>Antipaladin 1, Bloodrager 1, Cleric 2, Inquisitor 2, Medium 1, Psychic 2, Sorcerer/Wizard 2, Spiritualist 2, Witch 2</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, F (a ceremonial dagger)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level)</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>up to one living creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 round/level (D)</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Fortitude negates; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>You cut yourself with the dagger, dealing yourself 1d6 points of bleed damage. So long as you keep taking this bleed damage, your targets each bleed for 1d6 points of damage at the beginning of their turns. The bleed damage on any target ends if that target receives magical healing, or if your bleed damage ends for any reason. This spell has no effect if you're immune to bleed damage or can otherwise reduce or ignore the bleed damage to yourself.</p>\n<h1>Boneshaker</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Necromancy; <strong>Level </strong>Antipaladin 1, Cleric 2, Inquisitor 2, Sorcerer/Wizard 2, Spiritualist 2, Witch 2</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, F (human-shaped fetish made of bones)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one living creature or undead creature with a skeleton</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>instantaneous</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Fortitude partial or negates (see text); <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>By using a bone fetish like a marionette, you take control of a target creature's skeleton. This has a variety of effects depending on whether the target is living or undead.</p>\n<p>A living creature has its skeleton rattle within its flesh, causing it grievous harm. The target takes 3d6 points of damage, plus 1d6 additional points of damage per 2 caster levels you have.</p>\n<p>In addition, you can move the target 5 feet. This movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the movement.</p>\n<p>An undead creature takes no damage. Instead, you manipulate the undead, forcing it to take an immediate action to either move up to its speed (provoking attacks of opportunity as normal) or make a single attack against a creature of your choice in its reach. Either of these is the most basic version of the action the creature can take (it doesn't activate any special abilities that it could apply to the movement or attack, such as grab). A successful saving throw negates this effect. A mindless undead creature doesn't receive a save against this effect.</p>\n<h1>Borrow Corruption</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Transmutation [Evil]; <strong>Level </strong>Antipaladin 2, Cleric 4, Druid 4, Medium 2, Occultist 3, Psychic 4, Shaman 4, Witch 4</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (a dirty scrap of a good priest's raiment)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>touch</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>creature touched</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 minute/level (D)</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>none; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>no</p>\n<p>You touch a creature with at least one manifestation from a corruption (see page 14). You temporarily gain any stains and gifts that corruption grants to the creature, and the creature retains them. If the gifts have limited uses, you count as having no uses remaining. You take 1d3 points of Wisdom drain whenever you cast this spell.</p>\n<p>If your campaign uses the sanity system (see page 12), your sanity score decreases by 2 (and thus your sanity edge decreases by 1) each time you cast this spell, instead of you taking Wisdom drain. Only <em>greater restoration</em>, <em>miracle</em>, or <em>wish </em>can remove this decrease. A single casting of <em>greater restoration </em>removes one decrease of sanity from casting <em>borrow corruption</em>, while a casting of <em>miracle </em>or <em>wish </em>removes them all.</p>\n<h1>Contact Spells</h1>\n<p>There are a few nuances to <em>contact entity </em>spells that bear attention. First, not all eldritch creatures have a correlating contact spell. Contact spells do not replace or supplant <em>planar ally </em>or <em>planar binding</em>, so each contact spell targets an eldritch creature that is not an outsider. <em>Contact entity </em>spells might be useful for contacting other specific types of creatures that aren't listed, at the GM's discretion, and could be adapted for contacting certain outsiders.</p>\n<p>It's recommended that <em>contact entity </em>spells should be discovered in actual play rather than granted to PCs through level advancement. They represent ancient knowledge lost to most spellcasting traditions. Usually found in the form of scrolls or spell trigger items, an individual <em>contact entity </em>spell comes predetermined to work with a single kind of entity, with the appropriate material component already expended. Copying a spell to a spellbook from such a scroll doesn't let the caster know how to contact other creatures with the spell. Though the class lists for these spells includes spontaneous casters, this is primarily to let them use the spell if found on a scroll, not to have unfettered access to <em>contact entity </em>as a spell known.</p>\n<p>Some contact spells are evil, but many lower level contact spells are not. This is because certain Elder Mythos creatures (see page 193) are distinctly alien but not necessarily morally evil. There is also a rich tradition of spellcasters who traffic with dangerous creatures with the best of intentions; while actively summoning them onto the Material Plane is evil, merely speaking with them is not necessarily so.</p>\n<h1>Charnel House</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Illusion (Shadow) [Evil, Shadow(Um)]; <strong>Level </strong>Antipaladin 3, Cleric 5, Mesmerist 5, Psychic 5, Sorcerer/Wizard 5, Witch 5</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>10 minutes</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (one Tiny or larger living creature)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>\n<p><strong>Area </strong>20-ft. cube (S)</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>10 minutes/level</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will partial; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>no</p>\n<p>By sacrificing a living creature, you create the grisly illusion of viscera and gore splattered about the nearby area. When the casting time is complete, the walls drip with blood and the floor is slick with unidentifiable lumps of meat and other signs of a massacre. Anyone entering the area must attempt a Will save or be sickened for 1d6 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. If a creature succeeds at its save, it can see the semi-real nature of the illusion.</p>\n<p>The room itself is covered in a layer of slippery, semi-real gore. Any creature attempting to walk within or through the area of gore can move at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can't move that round, and failure by 5 or more means it falls prone (see the Acrobatics skill for details). Creatures that don't move on their turns don't need to attempt this check and are not considered flat-footed. A creature that succeeded at its Will save gains a +5 bonus on the Acrobatics check.</p>\n<h1>Compelling Rant</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Enchantment (Charm); <strong>Level </strong>Bard 5, Cleric 5, Inquisitor 5, Mesmerist 5, Psychic 5, Sorcerer/Wizard 5</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 minute</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M/DF (a handwritten sheet of notes)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>any number of creatures</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>concentration plus 1 round/level, up to 1 hour/level</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will negates (see text); <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>no</p>\n<p>You deliver a confusing but fascinating monologue, relaying conspiracies or metaphysical revelations that confound your audience, throughout the spell's casting time and as long as you concentrate. You take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain when you begin the speech and can't reduce or prevent this damage in any way. Each intelligent creature in the spell's area takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage as their perceptions of reality realign with yours for the spell's duration. Listeners with at least 5 HD can attempt a Will save to negate the effects. Your targets view you with a friendly attitude and respond to criticism of you with irritation. Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate checks to create doubt about your purpose in those affected by the spell take a -4 penalty. The attitude of your targets regarding any creature that criticizes you or your vision automatically changes one step toward hostile; a Diplomacy check that fails by 5 or more reduces their attitude further. Your targets retain the same alignment and their prior beliefs, in addition to the ones you force on them. You can't force beliefs on a target if such beliefs would be necessarily against the nature of its alignment and prior beliefs, but targets are otherwise able to hold contradictory beliefs.</p>\n<p>If your campaign uses the sanity system (see page 12), your sanity score decreases by 2 (and thus your sanity edge decreases by 1) instead of taking Wisdom drain each time you cast this spell. Only <em>greater restoration</em>, <em>miracle</em>, or <em>wish </em>can remove this decrease. A single casting of <em>greater restoration </em>removes one decrease in sanity from casting <em>compelling rant</em>, while a casting of <em>miracle </em>or <em>wish </em>removes them all. Affected targets take sanity damage equal to half your caster level (maximum 10) instead of Wisdom damage. The targets might actually change alignment and beliefs if their loss of sanity afflicts them with an appropriate madness, in which case those effects last even after the spell's duration has ended.</p>\n<h1>Table 4-1: Contact Entity</h1>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\"><strong>Contact Entity I</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"10\"><strong>Material Component</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Cerebric fungus(B3)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Scholarly tome</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Deep one(B5)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Engraved stone tablet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Grioth(B5)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">An eye struck blind during an eclipse [evil]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Nightgaunt(B4)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Sculpture of an animal with the face filed smooth [chaotic]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Ratling(B4)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Spell scroll of 1st level or higher [chaotic, evil]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Voonith(B3)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Bundle of cattail plants [chaotic]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\"><strong>Contact Entity II</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"10\"><strong>Material Component</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Colour out of space(B4)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Shard of a meteorite</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Denizen of Leng(B2)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Painting of a memory from a dream worth 1,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Elder thing(B4)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Magic item or piece of technology worth 2,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Hound of Tindalos(B2)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Exotic, trance-inducing elixir worth 500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Leng ghoul(B5)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Skull of a dead scholar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Mi-go(B4)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Fresh brains of an intelligent creature [evil]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Neh-thalggu(B2)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Vial of cerebrospinal fluid from a creature that still lives [chaotic, evil]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Rhu-chalik(B5)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Brain of a creature that had 16 Int or higher [evil]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Shantak(B2)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">A shard of rock harvested from another world [chaotic]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Yangethe(B5)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Scroll of an emotion(UM) spell of 4th level or higher</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\"><strong>Contact Entity III</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"10\"><strong>Material Component</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Aatheriexa(B5)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">A swatch of flesh recently damaged by magic [evil]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Deep one elder(B5)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Engraved stone tablet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Flying polyp(B4)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Eerie music played upon a wind instrument carved from the bone of a living creature [chaotic, evil]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Gug(B2)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Fresh flesh of a creature of 5 HD or more [chaotic, evil]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Leng spider(B2)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Head of a denizen of Leng [evil]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Moon-beast(B3)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Intelligent humanoid sacrificed while dreaming [chaotic, evil]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Spawn of Yog-Sothoth(B4)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">All blood drained from a sacrificed intelligent humanoid [chaotic, evil]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Wendigo(B2)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Must devour the flesh of sentient creatures with 8 HD total [chaotic, evil]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Yithian(B3)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Quartz geode</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\"><strong>Contact Entity IV</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"10\"><strong>Material Component</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Bhole(B4)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Jar of slime created by a bhole's breath weapon</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Bodythief(B4)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Chunks of brain from a lobotomy subject [evil]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Neothelid</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Ruby worth 3,000 gp [chaotic, evil]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Shoggoth</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Art object worth 3,000 gp recovered from the bottom of a sea [chaotic]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Star-spawn of Cthulhu(B4)</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Sacrificed humanoid of 10 HD or more [chaotic, evil]</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1>Contact Entity I</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Evocation;

see text</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>instantaneous</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>none; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>no</p>\n<p>You send out a magical message to any eldritch entities of a particular kind within a 100-mile radius, which can be delivered to up to 20 such creatures, starting with the nearest creatures until the limit has been met. This spell can't contact creatures with more than 6 Hit Dice. You can't send a specific message, but this spell (and all similar <em>contact entity </em>spells) can be characterized as an open invitation to make contact and establish communication. If there is an appropriate entity within range, the spell succeeds automatically. You don't know whether the message was received, nor any specific details about what creatures received it or how many. Creatures that receive the message know the location and distance from where the spell was cast. Because this spell doesn't call or summon the target, the target must have its own way to reach the place where the spell was cast.</p>\n<p>How creatures respond to a contact spell is circumstantial and it is possible the creatures will simply ignore the spell. Creatures that come and investigate do so in their own time. They usually arrive cautiously, aware of the potential for ambush. Targets of the spell might inform their organization or community if they have one. There are no restrictions on how the creatures react to being contacted, and they might respond with hostility, parley, entertain an alliance, or subjugate the caster and their related community. Using this spell counts as mentally contacting the creature for the purpose of any of its special abilities (such as the star-spawn's overwhelming mind). For the purpose of spells like <em>scrying</em>, the creature has firsthand knowledge of you and a connection similar to if it possessed a likeness of you.</p>\n<p>Each type of creature requires a different material component that must be included when casting the spell, as shown on Table 4-1: Contact Entity on page 112. Some of these components are expensive or might require quests to acquire. Contacting certain types of creatures makes the spell chaotic, evil, or both, as indicated on the table.</p>\n<h1>Contact Entity II</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Evocation; <strong>Level </strong>Cleric 3, Medium 2, Occultist 3, Psychic 3, Shaman 3, Sorcerer/Wizard 3, Summoner 3, Witch 3</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>200 miles</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>up to 20 entities of 12 HD or fewer</p>\n<p>This spell functions like <em>contact entity I</em>, except that you can contact creatures from the <em>contact entity II </em>list, and as noted above.</p>\n<h1>Contact Entity III</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Evocation; <strong>Level </strong>Cleric 5, Medium 3, Occultist 4, Psychic 5, Shaman 5, Sorcerer/Wizard 5, Summoner 4, Witch 5</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>200 miles</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>up to 20 entities of 18 HD or fewer</p>\n<p>This spell functions like <em>contact entity II</em>, except that you can contact creatures from the <em>contact entity III </em>list, and as noted above.

You can carry objects with you so long as you don't transport more than your maximum load. You arrive in a random open space within 20 feet of the creature and immediately begin sensing the location of creatures with a fear condition from your new location.</p>\n<p>Once you teleport to a new location with this spell, you can take no additional actions for the round, as if casting <em>dimension door</em>.

A spontaneous spellcaster takes this damage based on the highest-level evil spell she knows, even if she has no remaining spell slots available to cast that spell. A creature with evil spell-like abilities takes this damage based on the highest-level evil spell-like ability it can use.

The creature is staggered until the beginning of your next turn, at which point it dies. If the affected creature receives a <em>regenerate </em>spell before the beginning of your next turn, the creature gains the normal benefits of that spell and, thanks to its heart's regeneration, it doesn't immediately die when your next turn begins. If a creature that dies from <em>death clutch </em>is brought back from the dead by a <em>breath of life </em>or <em>raise dead </em>spell, it must also be targeted with <em>regenerate </em>on the following round to restore its missing heart or be unable to return to life.</p>\n<p>A target with 201 or more hit points that fails its saving throw manages to keep its heart from leaping out of its chest, but it is still staggered for 1 minute and takes 1d4 points of Constitution drain and 1d4 points of Constitution bleed.</p>\n<p>Regardless of its current hit points, if the target succeeds at its Fortitude save, it is still staggered until the beginning of your next turn as it feels its heart wrenching within its chest.</p>\n<h1>Decapitate</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Evocation; <strong>Level </strong>Inquisitor 5, Magus 6, Psychic 6, Sorcerer/Wizard 6</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 immediate action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, F (a sliver from a guillotine blade)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one creature (see text)</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>instantaneous</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Fortitude partial (see text); <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>You can cast this spell only as a response to a confirmed critical hit against the target that would deal slashing damage.

If the critical hit then brings the target to 0 hit points or fewer, the target is instantly decapitated and dies unless it can survive decapitation.

The target's body knows the direction and distance to its head. Without additional protection, the severed head has AC 7, hardness 5, and 10 hit points. Destroying the head while the spell is in effect kills the target of the spell. If the spell's duration expires normally without the head being reattached, the target dies. If either the target or the head are removed to a different plane, or if the spell is dispelled, the head teleports back to its owner and reattaches without further harm.</p>\n<h1>Dreadscape</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Illusion (Phantasm) [Emotion(Um), Fear, Mind-Affecting]; <strong>Level </strong>Bard 3, Medium 3, Mesmerist 3, Psychic 4, Sorcerer/ Wizard 4</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (a pinch of black sand)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>up to one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>10 minutes/level</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>Your targets see their surroundings as a nightmarish reflection of the world around them.

Being hostile doesn't necessarily mean the target will attack, and creatures can attempt Diplomacy checks to gain a target's trust at the normal DC. If a creature becomes frightened or panicked while under the influence of <em>dreadscape</em>, that creature takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage, though only once per casting of <em>dreadscape</em>.</p>\n<p>If your campaign uses the sanity system (see page 12), creatures that become frightened or panicked take 2d6 sanity damage instead of Wisdom damage.</p>\n<h1>Flesh Puppet</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Necromancy [Evil]; <strong>Level </strong>Antipaladin 2, Cleric 3, Occultist 3, Shaman 3, Sorcerer/Wizard 4, Spiritualist 3, Witch 4</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 round</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (an onyx worth 25 gp and a silken string)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>touch</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one corpse touched</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>permanent (D)</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>none; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>no</p>\n<p>You animate one corpse that has been dead no more than 48 hours. It rises as a zombie (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </em>288) that is magically tethered to you and obeys your commands. As noted in <em>animate dead</em>, you can't control more than 4 HD per caster level worth of undead in total, nor can a single casting create more than 2 HD per caster level.</p>\n<p>This spell disguises the zombie's appearance and allows you to control it. The zombie's outward appearance, movement, and voice appear the same as if it were still alive. The zombie's normal staggered condition doesn't apply (though it can still be staggered by other means). Successfully detecting the <em>flesh puppet </em>as a zombie without magic requires an opposed Perception check against your Disguise check, and you add your caster level as a bonus on this Disguise check.</p>\n<p>An ephemeral string connects you to the zombie. Through this string, you have a mental link to the zombie and can command it as a swift action. The zombie uses its own actions to complete your commands. The zombie can speak up to 25 words in 1 round, but you must mentally impart what you intend it to say as a swift action. It is incapable of articulating speech on its own. The zombie can be ordered to perform very simple tasks it knew in life but can't make attacks, cast spells, or perform complex or difficult tasks requiring constant concentration.</p>\n<p>The string connecting you and the zombie is nearly invisible. A DC 30 Perception check is required to detect it. It has hardness 0 and 1 hp. The length of string you can create is 100 feet + 10 feet per caster level you have. The string snaps if you and the zombie move farther apart than this length, though the zombie won't move out of range unless forced to do so or unless you command it to do so. If the string to the zombie is severed, the spell immediately ends. The ephemeral string can pass through physical barriers, but not barriers of magical force, and it can be damaged as though it were a physical object.</p>\n<p>When this spell ends, the zombie immediately reverts back to a normal corpse. The spell ends automatically if you cast <em>flesh puppet </em>or <em>flesh puppet horde </em>on a new corpse.</p>\n<h1>Flesh Puppet Horde</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Necromancy [Evil]; <strong>Level </strong>Antipaladin 3, Cleric 4, Occultist 4, Shaman 4, Sorcerer/Wizard 5, Spiritualist 4, Witch 5</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>10 minutes</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (an onyx worth 50 gp for each zombie and a silken string)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>touch</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one or more corpses touched</p>\n<p>This spell functions as <em>flesh puppet</em>, but can animate multiple zombies. As noted in <em>animate dead</em>, you can't control more than 4 HD per caster level worth of undead in total, nor can a single casting create more than 2 HD per caster level. A separate string attaches to each zombie in your horde. Severing a zombie's string reverts that zombie to a corpse, but doesn't end the spell for other zombies. Because commanding a <em>flesh puppet </em>requires a swift action, you can issue commands to only one zombie per round, though zombies you previously commanded continue to follow their orders. Likewise, you can command only one zombie to speak per round.</p>\n<p>Unlike with <em>flesh puppet</em>, you can command a zombie to attack. If you do, all your zombies immediately gain the staggered quality and no longer appear to be alive.</p>\n<p>This spell ends automatically if you cast <em>flesh puppet </em>or <em>flesh puppet horde </em>on a new corpse.</p>\n<h1>Flesh Wall</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Necromancy [Evil]; <strong>Level </strong>Cleric 6, Shaman 6, Sorcerer/ Wizard 6, Spiritualist 5, Summoner 5, Witch 6</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 Standard Action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (one corpse for every 5-ft. square of the wall), DF</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>a wall of corpses with an area of up to one 5-ft. square/ level (S)</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>concentration + 1 round/level (D)</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>none; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>no</p>\n<p>You animate corpses, forming them into a wall of joined flesh and limbs. The wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall can't be created so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. The wall must be vertical, but can be shaped as you see fit.</p>\n<p>The wall is considered to be undead. It uses your Will saving throw to resist channel energy.</p>\n<p>A <em>flesh wall </em>is 2 feet thick. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 12 hit points and DR 5/slashing. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. As a move action, you can cause the fleshwall to constrict, shrinking it by a 5-foot square to fill the hole. Additionally, as a standard action, you can cause a 5-foot square of the wall to permanently detach, forming a human zombie (<em>Bestiary </em>288) under your verbal control (this zombie doesn't count against your normal limit of commanded undead). The zombie reverts back into a normal corpse when the spell's effect ends. Each 5-foot square of the wall makes a single slam attack against an adjacent enemy on your turn, as a human zombie. The squares of the wall threaten their adjacent squares and can even provide flanking.</p>\n<p>Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action. The DC to move through the wall is equal to 15 + your caster level. A creature that fails the check is trapped in the wall, takes 3d6 points of crushing damage, and is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against the wall's slam attack. The creature can make an attempt to escape the wall on its next turn.</p>\n<p>You can use zombies already under your control as the material components for a <em>flesh wall</em>. However, they and any other corpses in the wall revert back to inanimate corpses when the spell ends.</p>\n<h1>Flickering Lights</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Evocation [Darkness, Light]; <strong>Level </strong>Bard 2, Cleric 2, Inquisitor 2, Magus 2, Occultist 2, Shaman 2, Sorcerer/Wizard 2</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 round</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (a patch of white cloth and a patch of black cloth)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>\n<p><strong>Area </strong>contiguous area consisting of one 10-foot cube/level (S)</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 round/level</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>You cause the illumination in the area to seem to flicker erratically, fluctuating between absolute darkness and blinding brightness. The level of light in the area changes at the start of each creature's turn, as determined by rolling a percentile die and consulting the following table.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><strong>d%</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Illumination level</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">1-10</td>\n<td colspan=\"6\">Supernatural darkness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">11-25</td>\n<td colspan=\"6\">Darkness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">26-50</td>\n<td colspan=\"6\">Dim light</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">51-90</td>\n<td colspan=\"6\">Normal light</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">91-00</td>\n<td colspan=\"6\">Bright light</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-tables.AXKcAWQisgYjMh38]{Horror Adventures: Flickering Light}(rollable)</p>\n<p>Even darkvision can't see through supernatural darkness (as <em>deeper darkness</em>). Bright light affects creatures with light blindness or light sensitivity. For the purpose of superseding its effects with higher-level light or darkness spells, <em>flickering lights </em>counts as a light spell when it increases the ambient light level and a darkness spell when it decreases the ambient light level.</p>\n<h1>Grasping Corpse</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Necromancy [Evil]; <strong>Level </strong>Antipaladin 1, Cleric 1, Occultist 1, Shaman 1, Sorcerer/Wizard 1, Spiritualist 1, Witch 1</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (pinch of powdered onyx worth 1 gp)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one corpse</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>instantaneous</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>none; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>no</p>\n<p>You can cause one nearby corpse to animate for a brief moment. Choose a creature within 30 feet of the corpse (even if the creature is outside the spell's range). The corpse shambles toward the creature and then attempts to trip or grapple it (your choice). The corpse does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>Attempt a special combat maneuver check against the chosen creature. Your CMB for this combat maneuver is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. If you chose to trip the creature, it falls prone if you equal or exceed its CMD. If you chose to grapple, the creature gains the grappled condition until it breaks free from the corpse. Treat your save DC for a spell of this level as the CMD of the grasping corpse. Alternatively, destroying the corpse with damage ends the grapple. The corpse has 12 hit points and DR 5/slashing.</p>\n<h1>Green Caress</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Transmutation; <strong>Level </strong>Druid 6, Ranger 4, Shaman 6, Witch 6</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (pinch of moss or a kudzu leaf)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>touch</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one living creature</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>7 days (see text)</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Fortitude partial (see text); <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>You cause the target to transform into a plant over time. You must succeed at a melee touch attack to infect the target. If the target succeeds at its Fortitude saving throw, it takes 1d4 points of ability damage to each physical ability score (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution) and the spell ends. If the target fails its saving throw, it takes 1d4 points of ability damage to each physical ability score immediately and continues to take 1d4 points of ability damage to each of its physical ability scores every day, until the spell expires. It can't recover this ability damage as long as the spell lasts, even with magic. While the spell continues, the target takes on physical plant characteristics as appropriate to the environment. It begins to diminish in height and its skin turns plantlike. For example, the target's skin might turn green and its hair is slowly replaced with grass or leaves or the target's skin might become smooth, pale, and flabby as the creature transforms into a large mushroom in an underground environment.</p>\n<p>If the damage to any single ability score equals or exceeds that score, the target fully transforms into a normal small tree or shrub. This final transformation is instantaneous, ending <em>green caress</em>. The target remains alive but is considered the same as a regular tree, shrub, or other vegetation. Any ability damage from other sources, like poison or disease, also applies toward transforming the creature. If the target retains at least 1 point in all of its physical ability scores at the end of 7 days, the final transformation doesn't occur and the spell ends. Any changes in appearance gradually reverse themselves as the ability damage heals.</p>\n<p><em>Break enchantment</em>, <em>dispel magic</em>, and <em>remove curse </em>can end the spell before the duration expires, but the spell is contagious. If a caster level check attempt to remove <em>green caress </em>fails by 5 or more, the creature who attempted to remove the effect must attempt a Fortitude saving throw as if it had just been targeted with the spell. If the spell's target attempts to remove the effect from itself and fails, it causes the spell to behave as if affected by <em>plant growth </em>(as described below).</p>\n<p><em>Polymorph any object </em>ends the spell and totally restores the target without any risk to the caster, even after the target has been finally transformed, as do <em>limited wish</em>, <em>miracle</em>, and <em>wish </em>(treat <em>polymorph any object </em>as if it had an instantaneous duration if it is used in this way). If the target is in the area of a <em>plant growth </em>spell as it is cast, it must attempt a Fortitude save at <em>green caress</em>'s DC or immediately take another 1d4 points of ability damage to each physical ability score; this stacks with multiple castings of <em>plant growth</em>. If the target is in the area of <em>diminish plants </em>as it is cast, it ignores the next ability damage from <em>green caress </em>to one of its three physical ability scores (chosen randomly); this doesn't stack with multiple castings of <em>diminish plants</em>.</p>\n<h1>Hedging Weapons</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Abjuration [Force]; <strong>Level </strong>Antipaladin 1, Cleric 1, Inquisitor 1, Paladin 1</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, DF</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>personal</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>you</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 minute/level (D)</p>\n<p>A weapon made from divine force appears and floats near you. This weapon takes the shape of your deity's favored weapon (if you have no deity, the weapon appears as a simple weapon with special significance to you). You gain one additional weapon at 6th level and every 4 caster levels thereafter-two at 6th, three at 10th, four at 14th, and a maximum of five weapons at 18th level.</p>\n<p>The weapon averts and deflects attacks, granting you a +1 deflection bonus to AC for each weapon summoned (maximum +5 at 18th level). As a standard action, you can grasp a weapon and throw it as a ranged attack at any target you can see within 30 feet of you (even if it's a type of weapon that can't normally be thrown). On a successful hit, the weapon deals 2d6 points of force damage to the target. This force weapon has the same threat range and critical multiplier as a standard weapon of its type, but no other special abilities. Because it deals force damage, DR doesn't apply. Each weapon thrown lowers the total deflection bonus to your AC by 1 as it disappears immediately after the attack action. The spell immediately ends once you throw all the weapons.</p>\n<h1>Holy Javelin</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Conjuration (Creation) [Good]; <strong>Level </strong>Cleric 3, Inquisitor 3, Paladin 2</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, DF</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>javelin of divine energy</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 round + 1 round/4 levels</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>none; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>You create a shimmering javelin of holy energy to hurl at an enemy as a ranged touched attack. The javelin deals 1d6 points of damage to an evil creature on a successful attack; it dissipates harmlessly against creatures of any other alignment. Each time a creature starts its turn while impaled by the javelin, it takes another 1d6 points of damage. For every 4 caster levels you have, the javelin remains in the creature for an additional round (to a maximum of 5 rounds at 18th level). While the creature remains impaled, it takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and skill checks. As a move action, the creature (or another adjacent creature) can attempt to pull the javelin out (causing it to immediately disappear) with a DC 12 Strength check.</p>\n<p>The <em>holy javelin </em>glows like a torch, and this light clearly indicates the impaled creature's location, even if it turns invisible. Since this light is not a light effect, just the glow of a conjured javelin, darkness spells always suppress it, even if they are lower level.</p>\n<h1>Horrific Doubles</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Illusion (Figment); <strong>Level </strong>Bard 4, Bloodrager 4, Medium 3, Mesmerist 4, Psychic 4, Sorcerer/Wizard 4</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>personal</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>you</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 minute/level</p>\n<p>You create several illusory doubles of yourself, where you and each image all seem slightly off or wrong in appearance. Treat this spell as <em>mirror image</em>, except as noted.</p>\n<p>Each creature that can see the doubles must succeed at a Will save or become shaken for as long as it can see any of the doubles. A successful saving throw negates the shaken condition and renders the creature immune to the further effects of this spell (beyond the usual effects of <em>mirror image</em>). In addition, the first time a creature that failed its initial saving throw destroys one of the images, it must succeed at a Will save or its perception of the double shifts at the last second. The double takes on the face of the attacker, the face of a loved one, or some other equally disturbing image, causing the attacker to become frightened for 1 round and take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage from the traumatic shock. Both additional effects are mind-affecting fear effects, and spell resistance applies against them.</p>\n<p>If your campaign uses the sanity system (see page 12), a creature takes 1d8 points of sanity damage instead of Wisdom damage.</p>\n<h1>Hunger For Flesh</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Necromancy [Evil, Mind-Affecting]; <strong>Level </strong>Antipaladin 3, Cleric 4, Psychic 4, Shaman 4, Sorcerer/Wizard 4, Spiritualist 4, Witch 4</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M/DF (a ghoul fang)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one humanoid, magical beast, or monstrous humanoid</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 round/level</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>Your target's belly distends and its front teeth grow longer and sharper. The creature ravenously craves the flesh of its own kind, gaining the staggered condition as hunger pangs rack its altered body. The target gains a bite attack as a primary natural attack that deals damage appropriate for its size (1d6 if Medium, 1d4 if Small). There's a 25% chance on each of the creature's turns that it can't overcome its hunger. If so, it must move directly toward the nearest corporeal creature of its type and subtype (if applicable) and make a bite attack against it. If the target lacks enough actions to attack on that turn, it moves as close to the creature as it can, but on its next turn, if the percentile dice indicate it overcomes its hunger, the target is not forced to pursue or attack further.</p>\n<p>On any round after the target deals damage to another creature of its own type and subtype (if applicable) with its bite attack, the target loses the staggered condition. If it doesn't continue dealing bite damage to applicable creatures, the target regains the staggered condition at the beginning of its next turn.</p>\n<h1>Hunger For Flesh, Mass</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Necromancy [Evil, Mind-Affecting]; <strong>Level </strong>Cleric 7, Psychic 7, Shaman 7, Sorcerer/Wizard 7, Spiritualist 6, Witch 7</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one humanoid, magical beast, or monstrous humanoid/ level, no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart</p>\n<p>This spell functions like <em>hunger for flesh</em>, except that it affects multiple targets. When forced to feed by the spell, affected creatures attack creatures not affected by this spell if there are any such appropriate creatures nearby, but otherwise they attack other affected creatures.</p>\n<h1>Impossible Angles</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Illusion (Figment); <strong>Level </strong>Medium 3, Mesmerist 4, Occultist 4, Psychic 5, Sorcerer/Wizard 5</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (a melted prism)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>\n<p><strong>Area </strong>contiguous area up to one 5-foot cube/caster level (S)</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 minute/level</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>You cause the surrounding area to appear to distort. The angles and corners of the area subtly twist and contort, creating unnatural and impossible shapes. Any creature entering the area must succeed at a Will save or become disoriented. Disoriented characters treat the area as difficult terrain and are sickened. In addition, whenever a disoriented creature uses an action to move (including taking a 5-foot step if it can do so in difficult terrain), roll 1d8 to see which direction it moves, in a similar manner to determining where a splash weapon lands on a miss (<em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook </em>202). On a 1, the creature moves in its intended direction, with 2 through 8 rotating around the creature's starting square in a clockwise direction. Only the creature's first 5 feet of movement each round are affected in this way-it can move normally for any remaining movement, either from the same action or from later actions, as the creature acclimatizes to the distortion. An affected creature can attempt a new Will save each round to end the disoriented effect. A creature that leaves the area and re-enters must attempt the saving throw again, even if it succeeded at its initial save.</p>\n<h1>Life Blast</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Necromancy; <strong>Level </strong>Druid 4, Ranger 3, Shaman 4</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (a dead leaf)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>150 ft.</p>\n<p><strong>Area </strong>150-ft. line</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>instantaneous</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will half; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>This spell must be cast in an area with vegetation or it has no effect. When you cast this spell, you draw the life force from the surrounding land and hurl it at your enemies, dealing 1d6 points of positive energy damage per caster level (to a maximum of 12d6 at 12th level) to any undead creatures in the spell's area. However, doing so blights the land around you in a spread with a radius of 5 feet per caster level you have (to a maximum of 60 feet at 12th level). All vegetation in that area immediately withers and dies. Plant creatures aren't affected.</p>\n<p>The blast starts from your palm and is able to travel through solid objects and obstacles.</p>\n<h1>Locate Gate</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Divination; <strong>Level </strong>Bard 5, Cleric 5, Occultist 5, Psychic 5, Sorcerer/Wizard 5, Summoner 5</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, F/DF (a small lodestone sphere)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)</p>\n<p><strong>Area </strong>circle centered on you with a radius of 400 ft. + 40 ft./level</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 minute/level</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>none; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>no</p>\n<p>You sense the direction of the nearest <em>teleportation circle </em>(permanent or with a remaining duration), <em>gate </em>spell, or other effect which magically connects two different locations (for example, an active magic item, a creature's special ability, or unique adventure location). <em>Locate gate </em>detects only spells or effects with a permanent or ongoing duration, not instantaneous effects like <em>dimension door </em>or <em>teleport</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Locate gate </em>can be blocked by spells like <em>nondetection</em>, if the effect originates from a specific object or creature. However, spell effects can't likewise be warded. For example, <em>ring gates </em>are a specific object, but a permanent <em>teleportation circle </em>is not (the surface in which it's inscribed doesn't count). <em>Locate gate </em>isn't blocked by lead, water, or other physical environmental conditions, but it is blocked by any intervening area that is dimensionally warded (such as by <em>dimensional lock </em>or <em>forbiddance</em>).</p>\n<h1>Mad Sultan's Melody</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting, Sonic]; <strong>Level </strong>Bard 3, Mesmerist 4, Occultist 4, Psychic 4, Sorcerer/Wizard 4, Witch 4</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, F (masterwork flute, pipe, or string instrument)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one creature/2 levels, no two of which may be more than 30 ft. apart (see text)</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 round/level (D)</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>You imitate the mad cacophony created by the awful beings associated with the Outer God, Azathoth. This spell targets only creatures with the ooze type, creatures with the amorphous special ability, and non-bipedal creatures with a special association with the Outer Gods. This music draws the targets' attention to the caster, as per the fascinate bardic performance. It affects mindless creatures despite the mindless quality typically granting immunity to mind-affecting effects, though it doesn't ignore any other immunity to mind-affecting effects the creature might have. The caster doesn't have to maintain the effect each round-the music continues for the duration of the spell. Creatures fascinated by <em>mad sultan's melody </em>become immune to any other casting of the spell for 24 hours after the spell ends, and the spell ends if the fascination breaks on any of its targets for any reason (such as an attack).</p>\n<p>If you have the bardic performance class feature and the fascinate bardic performance, you can choose to use the spell's saving throw DC or a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 your levels in the class that grants you bardic performance + your Charisma modifier, whichever is higher. If you choose to use the latter DC, each round of the melody costs 1 round of bardic performance and it counts as an active performance for determining how many performances you can have active.</p>\n<p>This spell takes a toll on the caster. Each time you cast it, you take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. If your campaign uses the sanity system (see page 12), you instead take 2d6 points of sanity damage.</p>\n<h1>Massacre</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Necromancy [Death]; <strong>Level </strong>Cleric 9, Psychic 9, Shaman 9, Sorcerer/Wizard 9, Witch 9</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (a flask of ectoplasmic residue)</p>\n<p><strong>Area </strong>60-ft. line</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>instantaneous</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Fortitude negates; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>You unleash a wave of necromantic energy that snuffs out the life force of those in its path. This wave pulses out from you in a line 5 feet wide and 30 feet long. The wave visibly rips the souls from the bodies of those it passes through, which manifest as screaming, transparent versions of the affected creatures. The wave kills every living creature of 17 or fewer HD in the line, starting with the creature closest to you, to a maximum of 1d4 HD of creatures per caster level. No creature of 18 or more HD can be affected. If a creature succeeds at its saving throw or has too many HD, it doesn't count against the HD the spell can kill The wave continues to affect creatures as it rolls away from you until you either run out of HD to affect or reach the limit of the spell's area. If the spell does not kill any creatures, the unreleased necromantic energy violently explodes in the final square of the 60-foot line, dealing 10d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level to any creature in that square with no saving throw. If several creatures occupy the same square, roll randomly to determine which is affected.</p>\n<h1>Maze Of Madness And Suffering</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Conjuration (Teleportation) [Evil, Mind-Affecting]; <strong>Level </strong>Psychic 9, Sorcerer/Wizard 9, Witch 9</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (an ornate puzzle box worth 1,000 gp and soaked in fresh blood)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one creature</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>see text</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will partial, see below; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>This spell works like <em>maze</em>, except the DC of the Intelligence check to escape is 22 and each round a creature remains in the maze a different effect occurs depending on which section of the maze it is in. Roll on the following table each time the creature attempts an Intelligence check to escape the maze to see which part of the maze it wanders through; if a creature doesn't attempt an Intelligence check, it stays in the same section and suffers that section's effects.

The creature must succeed at a Will save or gain a lesser madness (see page 182). The save uses the madness's normal DC.</p>\n<p><em>Haunted Forest</em>: The creature travels through a dark forest of grasping trees while shadowy beasts prowl at the edge of its vision. The creature must succeed at a Will save or become frightened for 2d4 rounds. This is a fear effect. A frightened creature can still attempt Intelligence checks to escape the maze, but it takes 3d6 points of slashing and piercing damage from the trees' branches.</p>\n<p><em>Hellscape</em>: The creature navigates a landscape of fire and stone walls carved with diabolical faces while the cries of the damned echo in the air. The creature must succeed at a Will save or become paralyzed by fear and potential torment for 1 round. This is a fear effect. The creature can't attempt to escape the maze while paralyzed, and if it fails three consecutive saving throws against this paralysis, the hellscape delivers a coup de grace, dealing the creature 4d6 points of fire damage. The creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + the damage dealt) or die. A creature that survives the coup de grace escapes from the paralysis as well.</p>\n<p><em>Oasis of Respite</em>: Whether it appears as a beautiful glade, a perfumed palace, or a literal desert oasis, this section of the maze is supernaturally peaceful, especially in comparison to the rest of the maze. The creature must succeed at a Will save or become fascinated for 1 round. The creature can't attempt to escape the maze while fascinated. A creature that fails three consecutive saving throws to this fascination enters a state of lethargy and gives up ever escaping the maze, remaining in this area until the spell ends on its own in 10 minutes (as per <em>maze</em>).</p>\n<p><em>Strange City</em>: The creature journeys through a city of cyclopean architecture under a sky of indescribable color and numerous stars. The creature must succeed at a Will save or take 2d4 points of Wisdom damage. If your campaign uses the sanity system (see page 12), the creature instead takes 2d10 points of sanity damage.</p>\n<h1>Night Terrors</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Illusion (Phantasm) [Emotion(Um), Evil, Mind-Affecting]; <strong>Level </strong>Bard 6, Mesmerist 6, Psychic 6, Sorcerer/Wizard 6, Witch 6</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M/DF (a drop of black ink)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>touch</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>intelligent creature touched</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 day/level (D)</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>The target of this spell gains no benefit from normal or magical sleep, writhing in a series of nightmares that torture its psyche and diminish its ability to perform strenuous tasks. The target doesn't heal ability or hit point damage naturally and can't prepare spells or regain spell slots. After one night of poor sleep, the target is fatigued (or exhausted if it was fatigued before trying to rest). A creature affected by this spell doesn't recover from the fatigued or exhausted condition inflicted by this spell after resting, nor do spells such as <em>lesser restoration </em>provide any respite. Each restless night, the target takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage, which also can't be recovered by magic while <em>night terrors </em>is active.</p>\n<p>The images from previous nightmares continue to haunt the target's mind while awake. If the target has rested at least once while affected by <em>night terrors </em>and then becomes subjected to a fear condition, the target experiences the next higher level of fear than it would normally. However, per the alternate rules for fear (see page 10), this spell cannot cause a lesser state of fear to become a greater one. If the effect causing the fear condition doesn't usually stack with other fear effects, the target's level of fear does not increase. This aspect of the spell is a fear effect.</p>\n<p>The affected creature can attempt a new saving throw once per day to end <em>night terrors</em>, but multiple attempts to rest in a given day do not afford the target multiple saves. A creature that successfully saves against <em>night terrors </em>ends the spell and rests normally that night but gains the benefits of only that night's rest, not any benefits missed on previous nights.</p>\n<p>If your campaign uses the sanity system (see page 12), the target takes 1d8 points of sanity damage instead of Wisdom damage.</p>\n<h1>Pessimism</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Enchantment (Compulsion) [Emotion(Um), Mind-Affecting]; <strong>Level </strong>Bard 4, Medium 4, Mesmerist 4, Psychic 5, Sorcerer/ Wizard 5, Witch 5</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M/DF (a shard of a broken mirror)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one creature</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 hour/level</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>You erode the target's confidence and instill a sense of despair. This fear of failure manifests as a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls. Additionally, the target can't gain morale bonuses of any kind while the spell remains in effect. No amount of achievement counters the spell's effects-the target simply explains away positive events with a self-critical perspective.</p>\n<p>Certain events can solidify the character's belief that it is doomed. Whenever the target rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll or saving throw, fails an ability or skill check by more than 5, or takes additional damage as a result of a foe's confirmed critical hit, the penalty to roll imposed by <em>pessimism </em>becomes -3 for 1 round. This increased penalty doesn't stack, even if multiple catastrophes occur on the same round.</p>\n<h1>Phantasmal Asphyxiation</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Illusion (Phantasm) [Mind-Affecting]; <strong>Level </strong>Medium 3, Mesmerist 4, Psychic 4, Sorcerer/Wizard 4, Spiritualist 4, Witch 4</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (an empty vial)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one living creature</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 round/level (D)</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will disbelief, then Fortitude partial (see text); <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>Your target must succeed at a Will save or believe it can no longer breathe. An affected target must attempt a Fortitude save each round at the beginning of its turn. The first time it fails the Fortitude save, it is staggered until the next time it attempts a save against the spell. If the target fails a second Fortitude save in a row, it falls unconscious for the spell's remaining duration. The target breathes normally while unconscious, but is shaken for 1 minute upon awakening. If the target succeeds at two Fortitude saves in a row, it shakes off the spell's effects entirely. Otherwise, the target continues to attempt a save each round until it falls unconscious or the spell ends. This spell has no effect on creatures that don't need to breathe.</p>\n<h1>Phantasmal Putrefaction</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Illusion (Phantasm) [Fear, Mind-Affecting]; <strong>Level </strong>Medium 4, Mesmerist 5, Sorcerer/Wizard 6, Witch 6</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 round/level (D)</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will disbelief, then Fortitude partial (see text); <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>You implant within the minds of your targets the illusion that their skin is rotting away, large rents are appearing all over their bodies, and their internal organs are spilling out into a putrid half-liquid mass at their feet. Those who fail to disbelieve <em>phantasmal putrefaction </em>immediately take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. This damage occurs only once. Each round at the beginning of its turn, an affected target receives another Will save to disbelieve the effect, and targets that fail must succeed at a Fortitude save or faint, falling asleep as per <em>sleep </em>(except that it isn't a magical sleep effect). Waking up doesn't end the spell for a target; it must continue to attempt Will saves to disbelieve and Fortitude saves to avoid fainting each round until the spell ends or the target successfully disbelieves.</p>\n<p>Targets of the spell perceive everyone else around them to be rotting away, but other creatures see no visible effect of the spell, so they, in addition to those who disbelieve, can communicate the nature of the illusion to allies, providing those allies with a +4 bonus on the saving throw to disbelieve.</p>\n<p>If your campaign uses the sanity system (see page 12), a creature takes 1d8 points of sanity damage instead of Wisdom damage.</p>\n<h1>Phobia</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Enchantment (Compulsion) [Emotion(Um), Fear, Mind-Affecting]; <strong>Level </strong>Bard 5, Mesmerist 5, Psychic 6, Sorcerer/ Wizard 6, Witch 6</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (a single white hair)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one intelligent creature</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>instantaneous</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>You instill the target with an intense, instinctual fear of a condition or circumstance, more powerful than the phobia lesser madness (see page 182). You can name an energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), a hazard (such as an avalanche or earthquake), or a single creature of the animal type or all vermin (applying when the target sees a swarm or a single Small or larger creature).</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can name the following specific environments: darkness (darker than dim light, and you can't apply this phobia to a creature with natural racial darkvision, see in darkness, blindsight, or similar senses), enclosed spaces (places that require the creature to squeeze),heights (10 times the target's height, and you can't apply this phobia to creatures with a natural fly speed), or water (you can't apply this phobia to aquatic creatures or creatures with a natural swim speed).</p>\n<p>When the target takes damage of the energy type (for an energy type phobia), or perceives the presence of the creature, environment, or hazard, it must attempt a DC 20 Will save. If it fails, it becomes panicked, but even if it succeeds, it becomes shaken and feels intensely uncomfortable; a creature shaken in this way does not need to roll further saving throws against its phobia until its shaken condition ends, even if it continues to be exposed to its phobia.</p>\n<p>A creature panicked by <em>phobia </em>can begin to act normally 1 minute after it ceases being able to perceive its phobia or after taking the energy damage if the phobia is an energy type, though the shaken condition ends immediately after the creature can no longer perceive its phobia. <em>Break enchantment</em>, <em>heal</em>, <em>limited wish</em>, <em>miracle</em>, or <em>wish </em>can remove a <em>phobia </em>spell.</p>\n<h1>Plundered Power</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Necromancy [Evil]; <strong>Level </strong>Cleric 7, Druid 7, Occultist 6, Shaman 7, Sorcerer/Wizard 7, Summoner 6, Witch 7</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>10 minutes</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (crushed rubies worth 2,500 gp and a major organ from the sacrificed target, see text)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one creature</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 day/level</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>no</p>\n<p>You must sacrifice a creature just as you finish casting this spell. When the sacrifice dies, its blood or ichor pools and hardens into a single red bloodstone. This bloodstone contains the essence and spirit of the sacrificed creature, allowing anyone holding the stone to activate the creature's highest-level activated racial spell-like ability, taking the actions necessary to activate the stored spell-like ability. Any creature who holds the stone can activate it, but the stone can be used only once per day (or the frequency of the creature's spell-like ability, whichever is less). If a creature has several racial spell-like abilities of the same spell level, choose randomly from among them to determine which one is stored in the bloodstone. The bloodstone can only store racial spell-like abilities that emulate a spell, including altered spells, like <em>invisibility </em>(self only), but not unique spell-like abilities possessed by the creature. Abilities with altered effects are still altered, so a creature activating the bloodstone for <em>greater teleport </em>(self only) would affect only itself and a bloodstone storing <em>summon monster II </em>(Small fire elemental only) would still only be able to summon a Small fire elemental. Additionally, the bloodstone can't store spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive components costing more than 250 gp.</p>\n<p>The save DC, caster level, and other attributes of this ability remain the same as when the creature was still alive, though the creature who activates the bloodstone can choose the targets, area, or shape of the spell, and make other decisions, such as controlling the target of <em>dominate person</em>. The bloodstone can take any actions necessary to manipulate aspects of the spell, concentrating on the spell, redirecting the spell, and so on, up to a full normal round's worth of actions.</p>\n<p>If the sacrificed creature doesn't die during the casting of the spell (for instance if it was merely a summoned creature) or is brought back to life before the spell's duration expires, the bloodstone loses its magical power. The fragment of the creature's spirit trapped in the bloodstone does not hinder attempts to restore the creature to life.</p>\n<h1>Profane Nimbus</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Evocation [Evil]; <strong>Level </strong>Antipaladin 4, Cleric 5, Inquisitor 5</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, DF</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>personal</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>you</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 round/level (D)</p>\n<p>You are surrounded by a nimbus of shadow shaped like your god's unholy symbol or a symbol of your faith. Any good creature striking you with unarmed strikes, natural weapons, or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time, the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you. Spell resistance applies against this damage. You also take half damage from magical attacks with the good descriptor. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.</p>\n<h1>Pyrotechnic Eruption</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Evocation [Fire]; <strong>Level </strong>Bloodrager 3, Magus 4, Occultist 4, Sorcerer/Wizard 4</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (a pinch of coal)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one creature</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>see text</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Reflex half (see text); <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>The caster causes jets of flame to erupt from the ground and surround the target. The target takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) unless it succeeds at a Reflex save for half damage. The blaze surrounds the target for the duration of the spell, forcing the creature to attempt a new save each round. Each round, the damage dealt is reduced to half as many d6; the spell expires when it would deal no damage. If the target moves, the <em>pyrotechnic eruption </em>follows, even if the target teleports.</p>\n<p>Anyone attempting to touch the target takes damage, using the same amount of dice as the last time the target attempted a save (Reflex half). A creature can take the place of the target by bull rushing or grappling it and switching places. The new creature then automatically takes the current round's damage with no saving throw and can begin to attempt Reflex saves starting on its next turn.</p>\n<h1>Quick Change</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Transmutation (Polymorph); <strong>Level </strong>Alchemist 2, Bard 2, Bloodrager 2, Druid 2, Inquisitor 2, Magus 2, Medium 2, Mesmerist 2, Occultist 2, Ranger 2, Shaman 2, Sorcerer/ Wizard 2, Spiritualist 2, Summoner 2, Witch 2</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 Standard Action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>personal</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>you</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 hour/level</p>\n<p>If you have the change shape special quality, you can revert to your true form as a swift action. If a creature is not aware of your true form, when you use this spell to revert to your true form and attack that creature in the same round, the creature is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against your first attack.</p>\n<h1>Rigor Mortis</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Transmutation [Pain(Um)]; <strong>Level </strong>Cleric 4, Magus 4, Occultist 4, Psychic 4, Shaman 4, Sorcerer/Wizard 4, Spiritualist 3, Witch 4</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M/DF (a knucklebone)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one living creature</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>instantaneous; see text</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Fortitude partial (see text); <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>The joints of a creature affected by this spell stiffen and swell, making movement painful and slow. The target takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per caster level. Additionally, the target takes a -4 penalty to Dexterity and its movement speed decreases by 10 feet; these additional effects last for 1 minute per caster level, though another creature can spend 1 minute and attempt a DC 25 Heal check to end them early. A successful save halves the nonlethal damage and negates the penalty to Dexterity and movement.</p>\n<h1>Sacramental Seal</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Necromancy; <strong>Level </strong>Cleric 8</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 round</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, F (an object worth at least 2,000 gp)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>touch</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>creature touched</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>instantaneous</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will negates; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>You trap the target in an object decorated with the holy symbols of your god or faith. While trapped in the object, the creature can't take any actions and is immune to spells and spell-like abilities. The creature remains permanently trapped in the object as long the object remains in your possession. Only a <em>freedom</em>, <em>miracle</em>, or <em>wish </em>spell can dispel the enchantment, though destroying the object frees the creature.</p>\n<p>If you relinquish your stewardship of the object (such as giving it away or leaving it in a remote location or extradimensional space), the trapped creature begins to gain control over the object. It immediately gains the ability to communicate telepathically with any creature now in possession of the object. It still can't take any actions besides communicating but can use feats and skills related to speaking (such as Bluff and Diplomacy).</p>\n<p>After 1 week of the object being out of your presence, the creature can create a number of haunts with a total CR (that is, the CR of the encounter with all of the haunts at once) equaling 1/4 the creature's Hit Dice. These haunts are centered on the object. The creature can also communicate telepathically up to a range of 100 feet at this point.</p>\n<p>After 1 month of the object being out of your presence, the CR total of the haunts the trapped creature can create increases to 1/2 its Hit Dice. In addition to telepathy, it can also impart mental images of its choosing into the mind of any creature holding or carrying the object.</p>\n<p>After 1 year of being out of your presence, in addition to the above abilities, the creature can attempt to possess any living creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher that touches the object, as per <em>possession</em>(OA). However, the creature can't personally destroy the object, even while possessing another creature.</p>\n<p>Because the binding magic irrevocably weakens the longer you're away from the item, returning it to your ownership doesn't reverse any of the effects. You must free the creature and impose another <em>sacramental seal </em>if you want to restrict its abilities again.</p>\n<p>If the object is placed in the stewardship of creatures or a location belonging to your faith, it still counts as being out of your presence but it takes ten times longer for the creature to manifest the above abilities (it would take 10 weeks for it to manifest the ability to create haunts, for example).</p>\n<h1>Sacred Nimbus</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Evocation [Good]; <strong>Level </strong>Cleric 5, Inquisitor 5, Paladin 4</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, DF</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>personal</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>you</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 round/level (D)</p>\n<p>You are surrounded by a nimbus of golden light shaped like your god's holy symbol or a symbol of your faith. Any evil creature striking you with unarmed strikes, natural weapons, or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time, the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you. Spell resistance applies against this damage. You also take half damage from magical attacks with the evil descriptor. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.</p>\n<h1>Screaming Flames</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Evocation [Evil, Fire, Mind-Affecting]; <strong>Level </strong>Antipaladin 3, Cleric 3</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M/DF (a charred animal or humanoid skull fragment)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>a sheet of flame up to 15 ft. long and 10 ft. high that moves 15 ft. in a straight line.</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>instantaneous</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Reflex half and Will negates (see text); <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>A sheer wall of flame appears and rushes away from you. Tendrils of fire reach out of it, shaped into skulls screaming in agony. When the wall passes through a creature's space, that creature must succeed at a Reflex save or take 1d8 points of fire damage for every 2 caster levels you have (maximum 5d8).</p>\n<p>Any creature taking fire damage must also succeed at a Will save or take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage. Deaf creatures receive a +4 circumstance bonus on their Will saves.</p>\n<p>If your campaign uses the sanity system (see page 12), a creature takes 1d6 points of sanity damage instead of Wisdom damage.</p>\n<h1>Sense Fear</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Divination; <strong>Level </strong>Antipaladin 1, Bloodrager 1, Cleric 2, Druid 2, Inquisitor 2, Medium 1, Mesmerist 2, Occultist 2, Psychic 2, Ranger 2, Shaman 2, Spiritualist 2, Witch 2</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M/DF (a patch of fur)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>personal</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>you</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>10 minutes/level (D)</p>\n<p>You sense the fear of those nearby, feeling it in the air around you. You can detect spooked, shaken, scared, frightened, panicked, terrified, and horrified creatures within 30 feet, and you immediately know what level of fear they are experiencing. You determine the creatures' approximate direction from you, though you do not sense a given creature's identity or know which squares the creatures occupy. If you're within 5 feet of a creature whose fear you sense, you pinpoint that creature's location, as if using blindsense.</p>\n<h1>Sense Madness</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Divination; <strong>Level </strong>Cleric 2, Inquisitor 2, Medium 2, Occultist 2, Paladin 2, Psychic 2</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>creatures in range (see text)</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>concentration, up to 1 round/level (D)</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>none; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>no</p>\n<p>You can sense the presence of mental disturbance in creatures within range, focusing your detection on one creature each round. If the target is currently suffering from any form of madness (see page 182) or addiction (<em>GameMastery Guide </em>236), has total sanity damage greater than or equal to its sanity edge (see page 12), or is under a magical compulsion that could be detected by <em>detect magic</em>, you can detect the presence of such a disturbance on the first round of concentration.</p>\n<p>If you concentrate on the same creature for an additional round, you learn if the creature's total sanity damage is greater than or equal to its sanity edge, and you can attempt a Sense Motive check against a DC equal to 10 + the save DC of the target's madness or addiction to determine the exact nature of a madness or addiction. Additionally, you can attempt a Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 11 + the caster level of the compulsion against each magical compulsion currently affecting the target that could be detected by <em>detect magic</em>. If successful, you can identify the specific spell affecting the target. You gain a +4 bonus on your Spellcraft check if the effect is <em>confusion</em>, <em>insanity</em>, or a similar effect that explicitly causes madness or insanity. If you successfully identify such an effect with <em>sense madness</em>, the insights provided by this spell grant you a +1 circumstance bonus on your next caster level check in the following 1 minute made to counter, dispel, or remove that specific effect. After attempting a check to identify a madness, addiction, or compulsion, you can't attempt that check against the same creature again, even if you concentrate on the creature again.</p>\n<h1>Sleepwalking Suggestion</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]; <strong>Level </strong>Bard 4, Medium 3, Mesmerist 4, Psychic 5, Sorcerer/Wizard 5, Witch 5</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (two doses of oil of taggit worth 180 gp total)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one creature</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>24 hours</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will negates or none (see text); <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>You compel the target creature to rise from its sleep as if sleepwalking and perform a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The spell takes effect immediately if the target is already asleep, or as soon as the target falls asleep if it is conscious. You can specify that the creature should wait before taking action when you give your instructions if you so choose. A sleeping creature doesn't get a save against this spell. The suggested activity must not cause the target to directly harm itself or others, but it doesn't need to be reasonable. For example, you could instruct the target to unlock doors and windows or poison its ally's rations, but not jump off a roof or perform a coup de grace action against a sleeping ally. Instructions that cause direct harm prompt the target to awaken just prior to performing the action and the target experiences a vague memory of what it was supposed to do.</p>\n<p>The target moves at its speed, but isn't capable of running or moving at a higher rate of speed. It moves in dark conditions as if it had darkvision and can perform most simple and skill-based actions, but it can't engage in combat, spellcasting, or actions that require significant cognitive awareness (like making complex decisions, solving puzzles, or using complicated magic items). If the creature takes any damage while sleepwalking, it must attempt a new saving throw. If it succeeds, the spell ends and the creature awakens. When the target completes the suggested course of activity, or when the spell ends or is dismissed, the target remains unconscious and returns to where it was sleeping and must be awoken normally. It retains no memory of what it did while unconscious (with the only exception described above).</p>\n<p>Unlike the <em>sleepwalk</em>(APG) spell, attempts to use <em>sleepwalking suggestion </em>on a creature that is unconscious for any reason other than sleep automatically fail. A creature affected by <em>sleepwalking suggestion </em>is unaware it has been programmed to act in its sleep (unless awoken because it was about to cause harm).</p>\n<h1>Slough</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Transmutation [Evil]; <strong>Level </strong>Cleric 5, Occultist 4, Psychic 5, Sorcerer/Wizard 5, Spiritualist 4, Witch 5</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M/DF (a pinch of dried skin flakes)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./levels)</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one living creature</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>instantaneous</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Fortitude negates; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>The target takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round as its skin loosens and splits. Once it has taken 5 or more points of Constitution damage in this way, its skin falls off to reveal its musculature. The creature ceases taking Constitution damage, but takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against disease, pain effects, or poison, and on Charisma-based skill checks with the exception of Intimidate and Use Magic Device. The creature's skin regrows rapidly-once its Constitution damage is fully healed, its skin becomes intact once again and the penalties end.</p>\n<h1>Stave Off Corruption</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Abjuration; <strong>Level </strong>Cleric 2, Paladin 2</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (see text)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>touch</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one creature</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 day/2 caster levels</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will negates (harmless) <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes (harmless)</p>\n<p>You ward the target to slow the advancement of its corruption. The target receives a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against the advancement of its corruption, as described in the catalyst section of each corruption. Multiple applications of this spell do not stack, nor does the bonus stack with morale, profane, or sacred bonuses on saving throws against the advancement of the target's corruption.</p>\n<p>The material components for this spell vary with the type of corruption. For example, garlic is used for a vampirism corruption, a sprig of wolfsbane is used for a lycanthropy corruption, and so on. The GM can determine appropriate material components, but the components should cost at least 25 gp.</p>\n<h1>Straitjacket</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Conjuration (Creation); <strong>Level </strong>Inquisitor 4, Occultist 4, Sorcerer/Wizard 5, Summoner 5</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (leather strap)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 caster levels)</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one creature</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 round/level (D)</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>none; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>You cause a straitjacket to spring into existence to restrain the target creature. You attempt a combat maneuver against the target's CMD. Your CMB for this check is equal to your caster level + 5 due to the straightjacket's Strength. This combat maneuver doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity, and if it succeeds, the target is restrained. This is similar to the grappled condition, except the target is able to move at its normal speed, the restraint doesn't cause the target to require concentration checks to use abilities that require concentration, and the target can't take actions that require one or more hands or arms to perform (including casting spells that require a somatic or material component).</p>\n<p>Once it has been restrained for 1 round, the target can attempt an additional saving throw against a magical effect that makes it confused, a curse, a fear effect, or a madness. The caster chooses which effect the target gets an extra save against. This extra save applies to only effects with durations of 10 minutes per level or less, and it doesn't apply to instantaneous effects. This extra save occurs only once per casting of <em>straitjacket</em>.</p>\n<p>A creature can attempt to escape the straitjacket with a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check, with a DC equal to 10 + your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest.</p>\n<h1>Symbol Of Exsanguination</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Necromancy [Evil]; <strong>Level </strong>Bloodrager 2, Cleric 3, Occultist 2, Sorcerer/Wizard 3, Witch 3</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>10 minutes</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (powdered garnet and bloodstone worth a total of 500 gp)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>0 ft.; see text</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>one symbol</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>10 minutes/level</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Fortitude negates; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>This spell functions like <em>symbol of death</em>, except that each creature within the radius of <em>symbol of exsanguination </em>begins to bleed uncontrollably and violently from their eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, as well as any existing open wounds. Creatures that failed their saving throws immediately take 1d6 points of bleed damage and are sickened as long as they continue to take bleed damage from the symbol.</p>\n<p>While a DC 15 Heal check or magical healing can end the bleed damage as normal, the bleed damage and sickened condition begin again each round so long as the creature begins its turn still within 60 feet of the symbol, including if the creature leaves the area and returns. Creatures that succeed at their saving throw suffer no ill effects from the symbol, even if they leave its area and return.</p>\n<p>Unlike <em>symbol of death</em>, <em>symbol of exsanguination </em>has no hit point limit on the creatures it can affect. Once triggered, a <em>symbol of exsanguination </em>remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.</p>\n<p>Magic traps such as <em>symbol of exsanguination </em>are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character who has the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is equal to 25 + spell level, or 28 (27 for a bloodrager) for <em>symbol of exsanguination</em>.</p>\n<h1>Temporary Graft</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Transmutation; <strong>Level </strong>Alchemist 3, Bloodrager 3, Magus 4, Occultist 3, Sorcerer/Wizard 4</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, F (a dismembered body part)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>personal</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>you</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 minute/level (D)</p>\n<p>You temporarily graft a dismembered body part onto yourself. You must have the body part in your possession or the spell has no effect. The graft must come from a creature the same size category as you. You can have only one graft active at a time. Grafting on a new body part immediately ends the effects of the older casting and causes that body part to fall off. The effect of the graft depends on the type of body part you choose to graft to yourself, as follows.</p>\n<p><em>Fins</em>: The fins grant you a 40 foot swim speed.</p>\n<p><em>Head</em>: The head grants you all-around vision. If the head came from a creature that had darkvision, low-light vision, or scent, you gain the appropriate senses at half the normal range. You can speak through either head, but not both simultaneously. You don't receive any additional special abilities the head might have had (like a medusa's petrifying gaze ability).</p>\n<p><em>Leg</em>: The leg increases your base movement speed by 5 feet and grants you a +2 bonus to CMD against overrun and trip combat maneuvers (the usual bonus for having an extra leg).</p>\n<p><em>Wings</em>: The wings grant you a 40-foot fly speed (poor maneuverability).</p>\n<h1>Torpid Reanimation</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Necromancy [Evil]; <strong>Level </strong>Antipaladin 4, Cleric 4, Occultist 4, Shaman 4, Sorcerer/Wizard 5, Spiritualist 4</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (an onyx gem worth at least 25 gp per HD of the undead)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>touch</p>\n<p><strong>Targets </strong>one or more corpses touched</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 day/caster level and instantaneous (see text)</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>none; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>no</p>\n<p>This spell works like <em>animate dead </em>except you set a specific condition for when the animation occurs and you do not immediately have control of the creatures. The condition can be simple, such as being touched, a certain word spoken, or on hearing a specific sound. You can also set a condition based on time, but it must occur within a number of days equal to your caster level. At any time, you can cause the animation to occur as a standard action.</p>\n<p>You can gain control of any uncontrolled undead you created with this spell as a free action if you are within at least 60 feet of the undead creature and have line of sight to it; if you have control of an undead you created with this spell and later lose control of that undead, you can't use this ability to regain control of the same undead. The limit on the number of Hit Dice you can control with <em>animate dead </em>still applies.</p>\n<h1>Verminous Transformation</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Transmutation (Polymorph); <strong>Level </strong>Alchemist 6, Shaman 7, Witch 7</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (a handful of bat wings, insects, and rat tails)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>personal</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>you</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 round/level (D)</p>\n<p>You partially transform your body into a swarm of bats, insects, rats, and spiders. As a standard action, you can send out a piece of your body to attack up to four Medium or smaller creatures (or one larger creature) within 10 feet of you. The creatures take 4d6 points of damage and must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d3 points of Constitution damage and 1d3 points of Strength damage; the ability damage is a poison effect. Abilities that protect against swarm attacks apply to this damage and spell resistance applies.</p>\n<p>Additionally, since your body is partially a swarm, you take only half damage from piercing and slashing attacks, unless those attacks would deal full damage or greater to a swarm (for instance, an area piercing attack would deal full damage to you). You can still be targeted by single-target spells but you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on any saving throws against them.</p>\n<p>Casting spells in this form is difficult and any spells with somatic components require a concentration check as if casting defensively; if you are also casting the spell defensively, roll a single concentration check at a -5 penalty.</p>\n<h1>Vile Dog Transformation</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Transmutation (Polymorph) [Evil]; <strong>Level </strong>Antipaladin 3, Cleric 5, Druid 5, Shaman 5, Sorcerer/Wizard 5, Witch 5</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>10 minutes</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (a strip of leather)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>touch</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>one or more dogs touched</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>1 hour/level</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Will negates (see text); <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>no</p>\n<p>You transform one or more dogs into evil, monstrous creatures. Each dog can attempt a Will save to negate the transformation, but if the dog trusts you (it has been trained by you for a purpose, or has been in your care for at least 30 days and generally treated well), it takes a -4 penalty on this saving throw. Each transformed dog has the same stats as a hell hound (<em>Bestiary </em>173) except that it doesn't have fire immunity and cold vulnerability and instead has acid, cold, and fire resistance 5. Additionally, each transformed dog deals an extra 1d6 points of acid damage with its bite attack (instead of fire damage), and its breath weapon is replaced with a vaporous cloud that spreads out in front of the creature in a 10-foot cone, dealing 2d4 points of acid damage. The creature can't understand Infernal but understands any languages you know. The dog is normally neutral evil, but is chaotic evil if you are chaotic or lawful evil if you are lawful.</p>\n<p>For every 3 caster levels you have, you can transform one dog (to a maximum of five dogs at 15th level). At the end of the spell's duration, the dogs immediately dissolve into a stinking pile of gore and bones.</p>\n<p>You can command the creature in the same way you would a creature you summoned via a <em>summon monster </em>spell. If you buy dogs to use with this spell, they cost 15 gp for a lap dog, 25 gp for a guard dog, or 150 gp for a riding dog (<em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment </em>82). Any kind of dog can be transformed by this spell and has the same statistics.</p>\n<h1>Waves Of Blood</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Conjuration (Creation); <strong>Level </strong>Bloodrager 3, Magus 3, Psychic 3, Sorcerer/Wizard 3, Spiritualist 3, Witch 3</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S, M (a drop of the caster's blood)</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>30 ft.</p>\n<p><strong>Area </strong>cone-shaped burst</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>instantaneous and 1 round; see text</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Reflex negates, Fortitude negates (see text); <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>no</p>\n<p>You cause torrents of roiling blood to push your opponents away from you. This wave attempts a bull rush combat maneuver against all creatures within its area of effect, and you bull rush creatures of any size in this way. Attempt a single combat maneuver check and apply the result to each creature within the area. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Any creature in the area must also succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or become sickened for 1d6 rounds by the tide of blood.</p>\n<p>The area covered by the cone remains slick for 1 round, requiring a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check from any creature attempting to move within it (as if moving on uneven ground). Any creature that falls prone due to failing the check must succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened until it stands back up.</p>\n<h1>Wither Limb</h1>\n<p><strong>School </strong>Necromancy; <strong>Level </strong>Cleric 6, Inquisitor 6, Shaman 6, Sorcerer/Wizard 6, Spiritualist 5, Witch 6</p>\n<p><strong>Casting Time </strong>1 standard action</p>\n<p><strong>Components </strong>V, S</p>\n<p><strong>Range </strong>touch</p>\n<p><strong>Target </strong>living creature touched</p>\n<p><strong>Duration </strong>instantaneous</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw </strong>Fortitude negates; <strong>Spell Resistance </strong>yes</p>\n<p>You cause one limb of the target to shrivel and weaken. The target takes 2d6 points of damage. The points are permanently lost until the target's limb is restored by <em>heal</em>, <em>limited wish</em>, <em>miracle</em>, <em>regenerate</em>, or <em>wish</em>. <em>Wither limb </em>affects only living creatures of the humanoid or monstrous humanoid type, or similar bipedal creatures at the GM's discretion. You choose the limb affected. This spell's effects stack, until all a target's arms and legs (or equivalent limbs) are withered.</p>\n<p><em>Arm</em>: The target looses the use of one arm, which might affect what weapons and shields it can use. The creature must immediately drop all objects held in the withered limb, though it can shift a two-handed weapon it is holding in both hands to a remaining arm as an immediate action. Worn objects-gauntlets, rings, and magic items in the wrist slot-remain. This prevents the creature from using two-weapon fighting, claw attacks from that arm, and so on. If multiple castings of this spell wither all of a creature's arms, it can't manipulate objects or cast spells requiring somatic components.</p>\n<p><em>Leg</em>: The creature's movement speeds are halved, except for flying or other speeds that don't involve its legs. If multiple castings of this spell wither all of a creature's legs, it can only crawl at a speed of 5 feet each round.</p>\n<p><em>Wing</em>: The creature loses access to any fly speed that depends on its wings if even a single wing is withered.</p>\n<p>^Spells and Rituals Horror Rules</p>"}

Chapter 1: Horror Characters}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The life of an adventurer has never been safe or comfortable. Terrible dangers lurk around every corner and the threat of death is a constant companion. Despite such grim realities, far more horrifying fates await those who find themselves facing off against true darkness: nightmares that thirst for the tears of the innocent and hunger for the flesh of the living. Adventurers who find themselves in a horror game must be prepared to face terror, madness, and threats to their very souls.</p>\n<p>This chapter contains new options and advice for players in a horror game. The majority of the chapter is focused on corruptions, a new subsystem that allows players to take on the role of a character slowly transforming into a monster and gaining strange new powers and drawbacks. Additionally, there are new racial abilities, more detailed and nuanced rules for fear, and a sanity system that tracks the stresses that weigh upon a character's mind and the terrible scars they leave.</p>\n<h1>Playing a Horror Character</h1>\n<p>To run an effective horror-themed adventure, the GM has to think about her game in a different light. In the same way, to get the most out of their characters, players in a horror game should consider their characters anew. This section is aimed at the player, and provides tips on how to create suitable characters for horror-themed Pathfinder RPG adventures. It also touches on how you, as a player, can participate in horror-themed games in ways that make the story more unnerving for everyone at the game table.</p>\n<h1>Participating in Horror Adventures</h1>\n<p>First and foremost, understand that horror games are meant to be creepy. If you don't want to risk being actually frightened, you don't have to play. If you do want to play, make sure you're familiar with the Horror Games and Consent section on page 190.</p>\n<p>Aside from their macabre themes, many horror games involve a different, intentionally darker sort of storytelling than other Pathfinder games. In a horror-themed game, the GM is juggling her story and the game's rules to not just tell a story, but to create an atmosphere of dread within the game. Joking around out-of-character and getting distracted can wreck the mood the GM works to create. Laughter relieves tension, which might be exactly what the GM is trying to foster. At the start of your horror game, point out this section to the GM and have her answer the question: How serious do you want the game to be?</p>\n<h1>Building Horror Characters</h1>\n<p>Characters in horror-themed campaigns are usually no less skilled or powerful than those in other Pathfinder RPG campaigns. The GM might also have special guidelines or expectations for the game's characters- particularly in the cases of supposedly fearless classes, like paladins-so make sure that you and she are on the same page regarding character creation before you get to work.</p>\n<p>During the process of creating your character, also keep this question in mind: What is my character afraid of?This isn't something that's going to come back and make your character weaker; it's a consideration to help you get into your character's head. Probably the biggest difference between horror adventures and other games is that they encourage you to have a more intimate understanding of your character as an individual, not just as an assemblage of numbers. Take a look at the sidebar on page 9 and consider working some of those elements into your thoughts about your character. These story elements will help your GM involve your character more deeply in the story, and help you as a player understand what your character fears and how your character might confront or avoid those fears.</p>\n<h1>Aspects of Horror Heroes</h1>\n<p>The GM is telling a story and wants to include you in it. Consider including one or more of the following aspects and let your GM know so she can work them into her stories.</p>\n<p><strong>Have a Goal</strong>: Strive to be the best at something, to create something, to see a place, to get married, or to achieve some other goal. Whatever it is, have something you want above all other things.</p>\n<p><strong>Have a Reputation</strong>: Maybe you're a great juggler, or maybe you slipped on the stairs in front of the whole town. Whatever it is, it's something locals remember about you.</p>\n<p><strong>Have a Friend</strong>: Whether a friend from school, a coworker, an army buddy, or someone you saved, have someone you're close to and whom you wish well.</p>\n<p><strong>Have a Home</strong>: It might be a neighborhood you love, your parent's house, or a room you rent; in any case, it's the place you call home.</p>\n<p><strong>Have a Signature Item</strong>: A signature item is something that is recognizably yours, be it a weapon with a distinctive grip, a piece of jewelry, a lucky charm, or your favorite scarf.</p>\n<p><strong>Have a Problem</strong>: Maybe you don't have any money, a member of your family is sick, or you're trying to get home. Whatever the issue is, you're doing your best to solve it.</p>\n<p><strong>Have a Secret</strong>: Maybe you can't read, left your crewmates to die, or made your long-lost sister run away. This should be something that would embarrass or endanger you if others found out.</p>\n<p><strong>Have a Reason to Be Brave</strong>: Maybe it's to be like your hero, maybe it's to repay a debt, maybe it's for your child, but have a reason to occasionally face your fears.</p>\n<h1>Plan to Be Frightened</h1>\n<p>Characters who aren't afraid of anything-or who are incapable of emotion-are the worst characters to play in a horror adventure. If the slasher bursts onto the scene and no one's startled or frightened, that's a bad sign for a horror game. Fight-or-flight responses, instant reactions, and expressions of revulsion are key components of a terrifying scene. In horror adventures, it is the GM's job to set up grim scenarios, and it is part of your job to consider how your character would actually react to these situations.</p>\n<p>That doesn't mean your character needs to be a shrieking coward, though. Your character likely is skilled with weapons or has the power to magically manipulate reality. By the same token, your character should also be a person. In the face of a terrifying encounter, consider how your character would respond. If you're not sure, think about your own reactions when to being frightened or unsettled in the past.</p>\n<p>If you decide that your character would probably have some sort of startled reaction to a scene, consider expressing that. Your character's actions might even intersect with specific game rules. As such, here's a list of reactions to frightening situations common among Pathfinder characters. Sometimes your reaction will be strong or important enough to warrant flight or a moment of shocked paralysis, but in other cases you just want it to be flavorful and not impede a more strategic response.</p>\n<p><strong>Cast a Protective Spell</strong>: You gird yourself with magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Draw a Weapon</strong>: Usually done while taking a step back, you both prepare for and distance yourself from danger.</p>\n<p><strong>Gape</strong>: You hold your ground, but look on in shock.</p>\n<p><strong>Guard</strong>: Moving into position between the threat and an ally, you try to prevent another from seeing the scene.</p>\n<p><strong>Pray/Swear</strong>: You call upon the gods or verbally express shock.</p>\n<p><strong>Retreat</strong>: You seek escape if the situation is overwhelming.</p>\n<p>Screaming might also be an obvious reaction, but that tends to be the domain of victims, not heroes (though, everyone has the occasional less-than-heroic moment). Retreating also seems distinctly unheroic, but in a horror game, that might occasionally be the prudent choice, especially if it is clear that a threat outmatches your group. Remember that in horror games, combat is not always be the surest path to victory.</p>\n<h1>Roleplaying Fear</h1>\n<p>When your character confronts a shocking scene, ask yourself what your character would do, what you would want to do, and what you would really do. These questions often have different answers. Let those answers influence how you react. Alternatively, you might hang on to the first thing that comes to mind, emulating more instinctual reactions to horror. Frightened or distraught people don't make the best decisions, so don't be afraid to make a snap judgment, act rashly, or react without consulting the group. In any case, your choice of action should usually be whatever you think will be the most fun or interesting for the entire group.</p>\n<h1>Conspiring with the GM</h1>\n<p>Sometimes, your choices might mean playing along with the GM. The GM is not your opponent-she's the conductor of a symphony in which you're a star performer. If she seems to be hinting hard toward a course of action, consider going along with it or mentioning to the whole group why you don't want to. The GM might also use any number of \"special effects\" during a horror game, such as providing certain characters with information only they know or asking to roll your dice for you in a specific situation. If that happens, oblige your GM. It could mean nothing or it could portend terrible things, but whatever the case, your GM isn't trying to cheat you. You're all just trying to make the game more fun.</p>"}

Chapter 1: Horror Characters}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>An abundance of horrors can scar a being. Wounds and fatigue can ravage the flesh. Poisons and venoms can putrefy a creature from within. Curses and hexes can assault the body and soul through supernatural means. But of all the horrors a hero might face, few are as debilitating or insidious as those that assault her sanity.</p>\n<p>The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game already features many threats that can erode a character's sanity. The <em>insanity </em>spell can cause a character to act confused until its effect is removed. Insanity mist is an inhaled poison that deals Wisdom damage. The allip, an undead creature created when a soul is lost to madness, features several madness-themed abilities.</p>\n<p>For some games, presenting the weakening of sanity and the onset of madness as assaults on a creature's Wisdom score or the randomness of the confusion condition might be enough.</p>\n<p>But running a horror-themed game often necessitates a more robust and nuanced system. In the following system, the mental resilience of a creature is based on the totality of her mental being and mental strengths, rather than her weaknesses, improving her chances to weather and triumph against a vast array of sanity-threatening horrors.</p>\n<p><strong>Sanity Score, Edge, and Thresholds </strong></p>\n<p>Each creature has a sanity score, along with a sanity edge and a sanity threshold. These values depend on the creature's current ability scores and ability damage. Increases and penalties to ability scores (even temporary increases and penalties) adjust these numbers. Each discrete instance in which a creature takes 1 or more points of sanity damage is called a sanity attack, regardless of what caused the sanity damage.</p>\n<p>Since effects that deal sanity damage are always mind-affecting effects, mindless creatures are immune, and do not have a sanity score, sanity edge, or sanity threshold.</p>\n<p><strong>Sanity Score</strong>: Your sanity score is equal to the sum of your mental ability scores (Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom) minus any ability damage taken to those ability scores.</p>\n<p><strong>Sanity Threshold</strong>: Your sanity threshold is equal to the bonus of your highest mental ability score minus any ability damage to that score (minimum) 0). When you experience a sanity attack, if the sanity damage from that attack equals or exceeds your sanity threshold, you gain a madness (see page 182), either lesser or greater depending on the relation of your current sanity damage and your sanity edge (see below).</p>\n<p>If your sanity threshold is 0, you always suffer a madness upon taking 1 or more points of sanity damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Sanity Edge</strong>: Your sanity edge is equal to 1/2 your sanity score. When you experience a sanity attack that causes you to gain a madness (see Sanity Threshold above), compare your total amount of sanity damage to your edge to determine the potency of the madness. If your current sanity damage is less than your sanity edge, then you manifest a lesser madness. If your current sanity damage is equal to or greater than your sanity edge, you manifest a greater madness instead. More information on madness, both greater and lesser, can be found on page 182. Furthermore, when you accrue total sanity damage equal to or greater than your edge, any dormant lesser madnesses you have manifest again.</p>\n<h1>Effects of Sanity Damage</h1>\n<p>When you experience a potential sanity attack, you must typically succeed at a Will saving throw to shake off or reduce the sanity attack's damage. Whether this saving throw is successful or not, if the sanity damage from a single sanity attack is equal to or greater than your sanity threshold, you gain a madness (see page 182) with a potency based on the relation between your total sanity damage accrued and your sanity edge (lesser if the total sanity damage is below your sanity edge, greater otherwise). In most cases, GMs should choose a madness that reflects the horror faced or your deep fears and potential mental breaking points rather than rolling on tables. For instance, if you gain a lesser madness due to an encounter with a mummy or some other undead that features a fear effect, it might make sense to choose the phobia madness. If you already suffer from delirium and gain a greater madness, it might make sense for that madness to be increased to schizophrenia. However, when a random madness is appropriate, the GM can generate one by rolling on Table 5-1 (for a lesser madness) or Table 5-2 (for a greater madness).</p>\n<p>You are afflicted with a madness until that madness is removed by the methods described in Chapter 5. You may not always manifest the madness, though. If you are afflicted with madness and then are healed of all sanity damage, all of your madnesses become dormant until you accrue further sanity damage. Typically, a dormant madness does not affect you at all, but some madnesses feature an effect that occurs only while that madness is dormant. A lesser madness that becomes dormant does not manifest again until you take sanity damage equal to or greater than your sanity edge. A greater madness stays dormant only as long as your total sanity damage remains at 0. Dormant madnesses, no matter the potency, can be removed only by <em>miracle </em>or <em>wish</em>.</p>\n<p>Lastly, if your total sanity damage equals or exceeds your sanity score, you become insane as per <em>insanity </em>(no saving throw) until all your sanity damage is healed and all your madnesses are cured.</p>\n<p>While <em>Pathfinder RPG Horror Adventures </em>introduces a number of spells, feats, monsters, or other effects that deal sanity damage, the GM is also encouraged to create her own sanity-damage-dealing effects in her horror game. The table below gives a number of examples of situations that might cause a character to take sanity damage.</p>\n<h1>Reducing Sanity Damage</h1>\n<p>Sanity damage can be reduced in a number of ways. The first is with time and rest. For every 7 full days of uninterrupted rest, you can reduce the sanity damage you have taken by amount of equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Instead of relying on your own strength of personality to reduce the effects of sanity damage, you can seek out a single confidante, mentor, priest, or other advisor. You must meet with that person regularly (at least 8 hours per day) and gain guidance during the 7 days of rest. At the end of the rest period, the ally can attempt a Wisdom or Intelligence check (whichever score is higher) with a DC of 15 if your sanity damage is below your sanity edge or 20 otherwise. If the ally succeeds at this check, you can add the ally's Wisdom or Intelligence modifier (whichever is higher) to the amount of sanity damage you remove.</p>\n<p>Sanity damage can also be reduced with magic. A single casting of <em>lesser restoration </em>reduces sanity damage by 1d2 points up to once per day; <em>restoration </em>reduces sanity damage by 2d4 points up to once per day; and <em>heal </em>reduces the amount of sanity damage by 3d4 points up to once per day. <em>Greater restoration</em>, <em>psychic surgery</em>(OA), and <em>limited wish </em>reduce your total sanity damage to 0 if your total sanity damage was already below your sanity edge; otherwise, these spells reduce your total sanity damage to 1 point below your sanity edge. <em>Miracle </em>and <em>wish </em>instantly reduce your sanity damage to 0, regardless of whether your total sanity damage was below your sanity edge.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\"><strong>Situation</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"3\"><strong>DC</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"4\"><strong>Failure</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"4\"><strong>Success</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\">The first time a character encounters a dead body</td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">10</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">1d3 sanity damage</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">0 sanity damage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\">The first time a character encounters a gruesome scene of death</td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">12</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">1d6 sanity damage</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">1 sanity damage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\">The first time a character encounters a horrifying creature*</td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">10 + CR of the creature</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Sanity damage equal to 1/2 the creature's CR</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Sanity damage equal to 1/4 the creature's CR</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\">Each time a character encounters a qlippoth or other creature with a particularly horrific appearance</td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">10 + CR of the creature</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Sanity damage equal to the creature's CR</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Sanity damage equal to 1/2 the creature's CR</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\">Each time a character encounters a Great Old One</td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">15 + CR of the creature</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Sanity damage equal to double the creature's CR</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Sanity damage equal to the creature's CR</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>* Horrifying creatures are typically aberrations, evil or chaotic outsiders, and undead. \"Each time\" could mean the first time for each creature type, or each time a creature encounters a new kind of specific creature of that type (for example, the first time a creature encounters a skeleton and then again the first time the character encounters a wraith), at the GM's discretion.</strong></p>\n<h1>Expanded Sanity</h1>\n<p>Effects dealing sanity damage and the madnesses in Chapter 4 are mind-affecting effects, and as such certain creature types are immune to them. In horror games, the GM may want to make an exception to this, at least in the case of sanity damage and madnesses, allowing undead and even some kinds of plant and construct creatures to feel the effects of insanity. The GM should be careful to determine whether the creature's immunity to mind-affecting effects compensates for an extremely poor Will save and potentially give a bonus on Will saves against sanity damage to such creatures.</p>\n<h1>Tenacious Sanity</h1>\n<p>In a particularly horror-themed game, the GM may consider removing some or all of the magical options to reduce sanity damage, relying on rest alone to recover sanity. For the most terror, she could even make sanity damage irrecoverable. In these cases, the GM should consider increasing the characters' sanity scores and sanity edges to ensure the heroes can make it through enough of the adventure before they snap.</p>"}

Any creature that strikes a babau with a natural attack or unarmed strike takes 1d8 points of acid damage from this slime if it fails a DC 21 Reflex save. A creature that strikes a babau with a melee weapon must succeed at a DC 21 Reflex save or the weapon takes 1d8 points of acid damage; if this damage penetrates the weapon's hardness, the weapon gains the broken condition. Ammunition that strikes a babau is automatically destroyed after it inflict its damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>\n<p>Implacable stalkers embody murderous predation. They not only revel in hunting down and killing their victims in gory, brutal fashion, but they draw supernatural strength and power from their victims' fear and terror. They look similar to other creatures of their kind, but are often covered in gruesome scars and exude an aura of menace.</p>\n<h1>CREATING AN IMPLACABLE STALKER</h1>\n<p>\"Implacable stalker\" is an acquired template that can be added to any creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher. Most implacable stalkers are humanoids, monstrous humanoids, or outsiders. An implacable stalker uses the base creature's stats and abilities except as noted here.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Rating</strong>: <strong>B</strong>ase creature's CR + 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Senses</strong>: An implacable stalker gains the following.</p>\n<p><em>Sense Fear (Su)</em>: An implacable stalker is able to sense the fear of nearby living creatures. This functions similarly to blindsight, with a range of 120 feet, except it only allows the implacable stalker to detect creatures that are currently experiencing any level of fear ranging from spooked to horrified (see page 10). Additionally, this ability allows the implacable stalker to detect such creatures even through solid barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class</strong>: Natural armor bonus increases by 6.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities</strong>: An implacable stalker gains DR 5/-, and resistance to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic 10. The implacable stalker also gains the following defensive ability.</p>\n<p><em>Terrifying Inevitability (Su)</em>: An implacable stalker is even more difficult to kill when in the presence of fear. As long as the implacable stalker is able to see or hear a creature currently experiencing any level of fear ranging from spooked to horrified (see page 10), it gains fast healing equal to its Hit Dice, its damage reduction increases to 10/-, and it gains spell resistance equal to 16 + its CR.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong>: An implacable stalker's base land speed is reduced by 10 feet if its base speed is 20 feet or higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks</strong>: An implacable stalker gains the following special attacks.</p>\n<p><em>Fear aura (Su)</em>: Creatures that have at least 5 fewer Hit Dice than the implacable stalker must succeed at a Will save or become frightened for 1 minute if they come within 60 feet of it. Even if they succeed at their saves, they gain the shaken condition for as long as they remain within 60 feet of the implacable stalker, and for 1 round thereafter. All other creatures within this radius must succeed at a Will save or become shaken for as long as they remain within 60 feet of the implacable stalker, and for 1 round thereafter. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same implacable stalker's aura until the creature has left the aura and reentered it. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>\n<p><em>Gory Display (Ex)</em>: Whenever an implacable stalker kills a sentient living creature, as a swift action, it can revel in the kill, shredding its victim's corpse in a gruesome display of power. If it does, it chooses one of the following benefits: gain a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Dexterity for 1 minute, regain a single use of a spell-like ability that it can normally use three or more times per day, or immediately heal a number of hit points equal to its Hit Dice.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, instead of any of these benefits, the implacable stalker can cause a single creature within 60 feet to become more vulnerable to fear. Creatures affected in this way lose any immunity to fear they may have. If the creature did not possess immunity to fear, it takes a -4 penalty on saving throws to resist fear effects, and all Intimidate checks attempted against it receive a +4 circumstance bonus. These effects last for 10 minutes. Finally, if the creature is currently immune to the implacable stalker's fear aura because it succeeded at a previous saving throw, it loses that immunity.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Qualities</strong>: An implacable stalker gains the following special qualities.</p>\n<p><em>Nightmare Resurrection (Su)</em>: When an implacable stalker dies, it creates a psychic imprint on the mind of each intelligent creature within 60 feet that witnessed its death. Each week, such creatures are subject to a <em>nightmare </em>effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 the implacable stalker's Hit Dice + the implacable stalker's Charisma modifier; the normal modifiers for <em>nightmare </em>based on knowledge and connection do not apply). In this <em>nightmare</em>, the creature is hunted and slain by the implacable stalker (for GMs using the nightmare dreamscape rules on page 162, these nightmares always have the \"being chased\" nightmare feature). A creature that succeeds at three consecutive saving throws to resist the effect is freed from it. If any creature fails at three consecutive saving throws to resist the <em>nightmare</em>, the implacable stalker returns to life, as per <em>true resurrection</em>. If its corpse has been completely destroyed, it returns to life in a random location within 5 miles of the creature that failed to resist the <em>nightmare </em>effects. Once the implacable stalker is returned to life, the psychic imprint fades from all creatures still affected by it.</p>\n<p><em>Right Behind You (Sp)</em>: As a swift action, an implacable stalker can teleport to an unoccupied space, which must be adjacent to a creature the stalker is aware of that has the shaken, frightened, or panicked condition. The implacable stalker can travel a maximum distance of 480 feet with each use of this ability, and must wait 1d6 rounds between each use. Additionally, if the implacable stalker travels at least 40 feet, any shaken, frightened, or panicked creature it arrives adjacent to is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against the implacable stalker's attacks until the beginning of the implacable stalker's next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Scores</strong>: Strength +4, Constitution +6 (if the implacable stalker is an undead creature, it gains Charisma +6, instead).</p>\n<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Implacable stalkers gain a +8 racial bonus on Intimidate checks, and a +6 racial bonus on Stealth checks and Survival checks to follow tracks.</p>\n<p><strong>Feats</strong>: Implacable stalkers gain Diehard, Endurance, Intimidating Prowess, and Toughness as bonus feats.</p>\n<p>^Bestiary Horrific Inspirations</p>"}

Chapter 1: Horror Characters}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your body is a vessel for an invasive otherworldly species that seek to spread across the stars and devour all other life.</p>\n<h1>CATALYST</h1>\n<p>You were infested with hive larvae (likely from a hive larva swarm; see page 236), but your body has metabolized the larvae and mutated you into something new.</p>\n<h1>Progression</h1>\n<p>A hive infestation increases over time as your body adapts. Each month, your infestation surges at unpredictable intervals a number of times equal to your manifestation level. Each episode lasts about an hour, during which you're racked by pain and must attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 15 + manifestation level). On a success, you weather the episode. If you fail, your corruption progresses to the next stage, but you don't need to attempt any further saves until the next month.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 1</strong>: The first time you fail the Fortitude save, your features shifts into an alien visage. You take a -2 penalty on Diplomacy, Disguise, and Handle Animal checks. Your alignment shifts one step toward neutral evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 2</strong>: The second time you fail, your body transforms. You are affected by spells and abilities as if your creature type were aberration. Your mental link with the hive shifts your alignment to neutral evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 3</strong>: The third time you fail, you succumb to the link. You seek out an isolated place and wrap yourself in a cocoon of resinous mucous, in which your body dissolves into hive larva swarms, which erupt after 24 hours.</p>\n<h1>Removing the Corruption</h1>\n<p>Curing a hive corruption could require fleshwarping (see page 164) or even seeking out the enigmatic anunnaki (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 5 </em>28) who created the hive in the first place.</p>\n<h1>MANIFESTATIONS</h1>\n<p>The following are manifestations of the hive corruption.</p>\n<h1>Acid Blood</h1>\n<p>Your blood burns like acid.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 3rd, transformed flesh*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: If a creature damages you with a slashing or piercing manufactured weapon, it must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or its weapon takes 2 points of acid damage per manifestation level; this damage is not halved before it is applied to the weapon's hardness. If a creature damages you with a slashing or piercing natural weapon, it must succeed at the save or take that amount of acid damage itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Your acidic sweat damages your equipment. After using or wearing an item for 8 hours total, it gains the broken condition. If you use or wear a broken item for 8 hours, it is destroyed. This ability doesn't break cursed items, artifacts, or similar items that are difficult or impossible to destroy.</p>\n<h1>Blindsense</h1>\n<p>You can feel the unseen.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 2nd, hive mind*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: As a move action, you can force the hive mind to use its senses to assist you. You gain blindsense with a range of 5 feet x 1/2 your manifestation level until the beginning of your next turn; during that time, you negate the penalty on Perception checks from the stain and instead gain a bonus on Perception checks equal to 1/2 your manifestation level.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You gain the light blindness universal monster ability. You take a penalty on Perception checks equal to your manifestation level.</p>\n<h1>Bristling Spines</h1>\n<p>Your body becomes covered in chitinous spines.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 3rd, living weapon*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Your spines can pierce walls, allowing you to climb quickly. You gain a climb speed equal to half your base speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Your spines make it difficult to move. Your armor check penalty for any armor you wear increases by 2. Even when not wearing armor, you take a -2 armor check penalty.</p>\n<h1>Greater Acid Blood</h1>\n<p>Your blood becomes even more vitriolic.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 5th, acid blood*, transformed flesh*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Whenever you take slashing or piercing damage, all adjacent creatures take an amount of acid damage equal to 1/2 your manifestation level (Reflex negates).</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Your blood is so thin it clots poorly, and its alien nature stymies magical healing. You take double the normal damage from bleed effects and lose double the normal amount of hit points per round when dying or when you act while disabled. The DC to stabilize you and stanch bleed effects on you with a Heal check increases by 5. Magical effects no longer stabilize you or end bleed effects-only a successful Heal check can do so.</p>\n<h1>Greater Hive Mind</h1>\n<p>The whispers of the hive call to you when awake or asleep.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 5th, hive mind*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: As a move action, you can communicate telepathically with one creature within 30 feet for 1 round. The hive whispers through the connection, causing a creature that doesn't have the hive subtype or hive corruption to be shaken for 1 round (Will negates).</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: The noise of the hive mind is strongest when you are at your weakest. Whenever damage causes you to drop below half your maximum hit points, you are also staggered for 1 round. Immunities don't prevent this staggered condition, and you can't remove it early by any means. This effect doesn't trigger if you are already below half your maximum hit points before you take damage.</p>\n<h1>Hive Mind</h1>\n<p>You hear whispers of the hive's collective consciousness.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: The strength of the hive mind bolsters your own, granting you a +1 bonus on Will saves. At manifestation level 5th, this bonus increases to +2.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Your mind is cluttered with other disparate voices. You take a -2 penalty on concentration checks, as well as on Intelligence- and Wisdom-based ability checks and skill checks, and you can never take 10 on such checks.</p>\n<h1>Living Armor</h1>\n<p>You can sheathe your body in an armored carapace.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 2nd, living weapon*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: As a move action, you can cause chitinous plates of armor to grow out of your flesh. This armor grants a natural armor bonus to your AC equal to 1/2 your manifestation level and persists as long you maintain concentration with a swift action each round. You must succeed at a concentration check as if concentrating on a 0-level spell, and your bonus to this concentration check is equal to your character level + your manifestation level. If you fail a concentration check, the armor retracts.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Growing living armor is painful. You take 1 point of damage per manifestation level when you take the action to draw out your living armor and every time you retract the living armor (either voluntarily or by failing a concentration check). While your armor is retracted, you take 1 point of bleed damage whenever you take piercing damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: Upon receiving this manifestation, you must take both the gift and the stain, even with the useful corruption or vile corruption variants (see page 14).</p>\n<h1>Living Weapon</h1>\n<p>Your hands contort and mutate into horrible rending claws.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain two claw attacks as primary natural weapons. These claws each deal 1d4 points of damage if your size is Medium (1d3 if Small).</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You take a -2 penalty on ranged attack rolls and attack rolls with manufactured weapons because of your deformed hands.</p>\n<h1>Resin Secretion</h1>\n<p>Your body produces a resinous spittle.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 5th, living weapon*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: As a standard action, you can expel spittle that rapidly hardens into a resin. This effect is identical to the <em>web </em>spell with a caster level equal to your manifestation level, except it targets a single 5-foot space, has a hardness of 1, and has 2 hit points per manifestation level you have. Creatures caught in the spray can attempt a Reflex save to avoid the effect. The resin lasts for 1 minute before crumbling to dust.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Whenever you use your resin secretion gift, you are nauseated until the end of your next turn. Immunities don't prevent this nauseated condition, and you can't remove it early by any means.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: Upon receiving this manifestation, you must take both the gift and the stain, even with the useful corruption or vile corruption variants (see page 14).</p>\n<h1>Transformed Flesh</h1>\n<p>Your gain some of a hive creature's resistance to acid.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain acid resistance 5. At manifestation level 5th, this acid resistance increases to 10.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: The entirety of your flesh darkens and mutates to look more like that of a hive creature. You take a -2 penalty to your Charisma score.</p>"}

Chapter 2: Archetypes And Class Options}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>To a witch, even the simple things can be a tools of terror.</p>\n<h1>PATRON SPELLS</h1>\n<p>Some witches have patron themes that are associated with the Elder Mythos.</p>\n<p><strong>Conspiracies</strong>: 2nd-<em>lock gaze</em>(UC); 4th-<em>disguise other</em>(UM); 6th-<em>tongues</em>; 8th-<em>hypercognition</em>(OA); 10th-<em>dominate person</em>; 12th-<em>symbol of persuasion</em>; 14th-<em>vision</em>; 16th-<em>frightful aspect</em>(UC); 18th-<em>overwhelming presence</em>(UM).</p>\n<p><strong>Decadence</strong>: 2nd-<em>negative reaction</em>(UC); 4th-<em>demand offering</em>(OA); 6th-<em>sepia snake sigil</em>; 8th-<em>charm monster</em>; 10th-<em>dream</em>; 12th-<em>envious urge</em>(UM); 14th-<em>waves of ecstasy</em>(UM); 16th-<em>euphoric tranquility</em>(APG); 18th-<em>symbol of strife</em>(UM).</p>\n<p><strong>Entropy</strong>: 2nd-<em>lesser confusion</em>; 4th-<em>plague carrier</em>(UM); 6th- <em>babble</em>(OA); 8th-<em>wandering star motes</em>(APG); 10th-<em>feeblemind</em>; 12th-<em>antimagic field</em>; 14th-<em>insanity</em>; 16th-<em>symbol of insanity</em>; 18th-<em>interplanetary teleport</em>(UM).</p>\n<p><strong>Nightmares</strong>: 2nd-<em>sleep</em>; 4th-<em>detect thoughts</em>; 6th-<em>oneiric horror</em>(OA); 8th-<em>phantasmal killer</em>; 10th-<em>nightmare</em>; 12th- <em>dream travel</em>(OA); 14th-<em>symbol of weakness</em>; 16th-<em>demand</em>; 18th-<em>polar midnight</em>(UM).</p>\n<p><strong>Revenge</strong>: 2nd-<em>magic fang</em>; 4th-<em>slipstream</em>(APG); 6th-<em>rage</em>; 8th-<em>moonstruck</em>(APG); 10th-<em>beast shape III</em>; 12th-<em>vengeful outrage</em>(UM); 14th-<em>phantasmal revenge</em>(APG); 16th-<em>seamantle</em>(APG); 18th-<em>storm of vengeance</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Space</strong>: 2nd-<em>mirror strike</em>(UC); 4th-<em>twisted space</em>(UC); 6th- <em>blink</em>; 8th-<em>dimension door</em>; 10th-<em>hostile juxtaposition</em>(UC); 12th-<em>repulsion</em>; 14th-<em>walk through space</em>(UC); 16th-<em>bilocation</em>(OA); 18th-<em>teleportation circle</em>.</p>\n<h1>Gingerbread Witch (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>A sweet tooth lures the gingerbread witch's victims to doom.</p>\n<p><strong>Gingerbread Familiar (Ex)</strong>: A gingerbread witch concocts her familiar out of gingerbread, sugar, and other confections. It has the shape of the original animal or vermin, but its type changes to construct. As a construct, it gains 60-foot darkvision and construct immunities, it loses any special abilities the animal or vermin has other than movement speed, and it doesn't provide the usual familiar benefit (for instance, a gingerbread toad doesn't provide 3 bonus hit points). With a supply of flour and sugar at hand, the gingerbread witch can spend 8 hours and use her cauldron to restore her familiar to full health at no cost, unless the familiar is destroyed, in which case she must follow the usual rules for replacing her familiar. A gingerbread witch can never gain an improved familiar.</p>\n<p>This ability alters familiar.</p>\n<p><strong>Cauldron Cook (Ex)</strong>: A gingerbread witch gains the cauldron and child-scent(UM) hexes at 1st level. When brewing potions with her cauldron, she can create small candies, pastries, or similar edible items identical in effect and application to normal potions. At 10th level, she gains the cook people(UM) hex.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces the hexes gained at 1st and 10th levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Tricky Treats Hex (Sp)</strong>: At 4th level, a gingerbread witch learns a unique hex that lets her create a piece of candy or a similar sweet as a full-round action. If eaten by the witch or a single creature she designates when she creates it, the sweet functions as <em>goodberry </em>or a <em>polypurpose panacea</em>(UM) (as determined at creation).</p>\n<p>Anyone else that eats the sweet becomes nauseated (Fortitude negates); a creature nauseated by the sweet can attempt a new saving throw each round at the end of its turn to end this effect. A creature that fails its initial save is also affected as per the scar(UM) hex for a number of days equal to the witch's witch level, except that at extended range, the witch can use only harmful hexes on the creature.</p>\n<p>She can create a number of sweets each day equal to her Intelligence modifier + her level. These sweets retain their potency for 24 hours and then turn to crumbs.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces the hex gained at 4th level.</p>\n<p><strong>Confection Conjuring (Sp)</strong>: At 8th level, a gingerbread witch can use <em>shadow conjuration </em>as a spell-like ability. Items and creatures she conjures appear to be made of fanciful foodstuffs, and because of this, sentient creatures gain a +2 bonus on Will saves to disbelieve the illusion. However, they otherwise function as described for the <em>shadow conjuration </em>spell. For every 3 witch levels beyond 8th, the gingerbread witch can duplicate conjuration (creation) and conjuration (summoning) spells of 1 level higher, up to a maximum of 7th-level spell effects at 20th level (though they are still only 20% real). The witch can use this ability once per day for every 4 witch levels she has.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces the hex gained at 8th level.</p>\n<p><strong>Gruesome Gobbler (Ex)</strong>: At 12th level, a gingerbread witch gains a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage for a Medium witch. As a full-round action, she can make a single bite attack that deals double base damage (2d6 for a Medium witch) and functions as if she had the grab and swallow whole special attacks, allowing her to grab and swallow a creature of her size or smaller. Her stomach doesn't deal damage to swallowed creatures, but a living creature she swallows must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 her witch level + Constitution modifier) at the beginning of each of its turns or become nauseated for 1 round.</p>\n<p>If a gingerbread witch successfully swallows a creature, her torso distends grotesquely and she is treated as if she were carrying a heavy load if the creature is the same size and a medium load if it's one size smaller; regardless, she can swallow only one such creature at a time. Creatures two or more sizes smaller do not distend her belly, though every four creatures of a smaller size count as one creature one size category larger (she can swallow 4 Tiny, 16 Diminutive, or 64 Fine creatures). She can regurgitate a swallowed creature of her choice as a move action, leaving it prone in an adjacent open square. If she is struck with a confirmed critical hit while she has a creature swallowed, the swallowed creatures each take half as much damage as the witch does (this doesn't reduce the damage the gingerbread witch takes).</p>\n<p>This ability replaces the hex gained at 12th level.</p>\n<p><strong>Horrible Hunger (Sp)</strong>: At 16th level, a gingerbread witch can affect a target as if she had cast <em>feast of ashes</em>(APG) on it, but with her hex DC instead of the spell's DC. This hunger is so intense that any creature can offer the target food as a standard action and the target is compelled to eat it, as if the creature offering it had cast <em>beguiling gift</em>(APG) (with a DC and caster level equal to that of the witch's hexes). She can use this ability once per day for every 4 witch levels she has.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces the hex gained at 16th level.</p>\n<h1>Tatterdemalion (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Some witches can bend the warp and weft of fabric and thread.</p>\n<p><strong>Weapon Proficiency</strong>: A tatterdemalion is proficient with bolas, nets, and whips.</p>\n<p>This alters the witch's weapon proficiencies.</p>\n<p><strong>Cantrips</strong>: A tatterdemalion must choose <em>mage hand, open/ close, </em>and <em>prestidigitation </em>as her prepared cantrips at 1st level, and they require a piece of cloth, string, rope, or other woven material (including clothing) as a focus. Any action she takes with these cantrips must involve the focus. Starting at 2nd level, she can choose any cantrip for her remaining cantrip.</p>\n<p>This alters the witch's cantrips.</p>\n<p><strong>Dancing Strings (Su)</strong>: A tatterdemalion adds <em>animate rope </em>to her class spell list and spells her familiar knows. She can control her clothing and cloth, rope, or woven fabric she wears in a manner otherwise identical to the prehensile hair(UM) hex.</p>\n<p>This alters spells and replaces the hex gained at 1st level.</p>\n<p><strong>Witchweaver</strong>: A tatterdemalion gains the following unique hexes, with a caster level equal to her witch level.</p>\n<p><em>Moth-Eaten (Sp)</em>: At 4th level, a tatterdemalion can make a touch attack that damages leather, rope, or cloth like <em>rusting grasp </em>damages metal, once per day per witch level.</p>\n<p><em>Lace Weaver (Sp)</em>: At 8th level, a tatterdemalion can create cloth as per <em>minor creation </em>or create one 5-foot cube of tangled skeins of cloth per witch level, affecting the target areas as per <em>web</em>, once per day for every 4 witch levels she has.</p>\n<p><em>Sinister Stitching (Su)</em>: At 12th level, once per day for every 4 witch levels she has, a tatterdemalion can conjure enchanted threads to hinder a creature she can see (Fortitude negates). The tatterdemalion can choose to either sew shut the target's eyes (blinding it) or mouth (preventing speech, bite attacks, breath weapons, verbal components, command words, and the like). The target can end the effect with a successful Strength check (DC = 15 + 1/2 the tatterdemalion's witch level) as a standard action, or by slashing the stitches with a magic slashing weapon as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Either way, the victim takes 1d4 points of bleed damage and either is dazzled (for stitched eyes) or takes a -2 penalty on bite attack and damage rolls and a 20% chance of spell failure with verbal components (for a stitched mouth). Either residual effect lasts 1 minute per witch level. Any creature can safely remove the enchanted threads with a minute of work and a successful DC 25 Heal check.</p>\n<p><em>Unravel (Su)</em>: At 16th level, once per day when a tatterdemalion is hit by a melee or ranged attack, she can unravel herself as an immediate action, causing her body and gear to appear to collapse into a bundle of tattered rags and strands while she teleports to any open square within 30 feet. She takes no damage from the triggering attack, but she must have line of effect to the target square. She can use this ability twice per day at 20th level.</p>\n<p>These replace the hexes gained at 4th, 8th, 12th, and 16th levels.</p>\n<p>^Archetypes and Class Options Feats</p>"}

Able to move and talk, these constructs can also step out of their frames to become three-dimensional beings. Born from artistic masterpieces, trompe l'oeils can easily pass for their original models, though close examination reveals that they are not flesh and blood, but only layers of paint. Trompe l'oeils can be created to act as guardians and spies, or on occasion, a painting will animate spontaneously. Rarely, a portrait is so lifelike, a nascent spirit is able to inhabit it. Believing itself to be as good as or better than the original, such a trompe l'oeil seeks to eliminate and replace the painting's subject.</p>\n<h1>CREATING A TROMPE L'OEIL</h1>\n<p>\"Trompe l'oeil\" is an inherited template that can be added to any corporeal creature that has an Intelligence score (referred to hereafter as the base creature).</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Rating</strong>: Base creature's CR + 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: A trompe l'oeil usually has the same alignment as its creator or the base creature. A trompe l'oeil that seeks to destroy its original model, however, has an evil alignment (but the same alignment on the chaotic/lawful axis).</p>\n<p><strong>Type</strong>: The creature's type changes to construct. Do not recalculate BAB, saves, or skill ranks.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class</strong>: A trompe l'oeil gains a bonus to AC based on its HD, as noted in the following table. If it is depicted wearing armor or a shield, these items are masterwork and gain an enhancement bonus (or equivalent armor special abilities) when worn by the trompe l'oeil, as indicated in the table. If the trompe l'oeil is depicted without armor, add the armor enhancement bonus to its natural armor bonus instead. Armor and shields equipped by a trompe l'oeil melt into puddles of nonmagical paint when the creature is destroyed.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Trompe l'Oeil HD</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Armor Enhancement Bonus</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Shield Enhancement Bonus</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1-4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5-8</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9-12</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13-16</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17+</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice</strong>: Change all of the creature's racial Hit Dice to d10s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged. As constructs, trompe l'oeils gain a number of additional hit points as noted in the following table.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Trompe l'Oeil Size</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Bonus Hit Points</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tiny or smaller</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Small</td>\n<td>+10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>+20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>+30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>+40</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>+60</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Colossal</td>\n<td>+80</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities</strong>: A trompe l'oeil gains the standard immunities and traits of construct creatures. In addition, it gains rejuvenation.</p>\n<p><em>Rejuvenation (Su)</em>: When a trompe l'oeil is destroyed, it reforms 2d4 days later on its original canvas (see page 243). The only way to permanently destroy a trompe l'oeil is to destroy the original canvas before the creature reforms.</p>\n<p><strong>Attacks</strong>: A trompe l'oeil retains all weapon proficiencies and natural weapons. If it's depicted wielding any manufactured weapons, the weapons are masterwork and gain an enhancement bonus (or equivalent weapon special abilities) when wielded by it. The bonus is based on its HD, as noted in the following table. A trompe l'oeil's weapons melt into puddles of nonmagical paint when the creature is destroyed.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Trompe l'Oeil HD</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Weapon Enhancement Bonus</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1-3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4-6</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7-9</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10-12</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13-15</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16+</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Abilities</strong>: A trompe l'oeil has no Constitution score.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills</strong>: A trompe l'oeil gains a +10 racial bonus on Disguise checks to appear as the base creature. It also receives a +5 bonus on Bluff checks to pretend to be the base creature and a +5 bonus on Stealth checks to appear as part of a painting.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Qualities</strong>: A trompe l'oeil gains the following special qualities.</p>\n<p><em>Autotelic (Ex)</em>: A trompe l'oeil uses its Charisma score in place of its Constitution score when calculating hit points, Fortitude saves, and any special ability that relies on Constitution (such as when calculating a breath weapon's DC).</p>\n<p><em>Enter Painting (Su)</em>: As a standard action, a trompe l'oeil can enter a painting it touches. When it does so, its physical body disappears, and its image appears in the painting. The trompe l'oeil can use its normal senses and attempt Perception checks to notice anything occurring near the painting. While within a painting, the trompe l'oeil can talk and move anywhere within the picture or even temporarily alter it (such as by picking a flower in the painting). It cannot use any spells or other abilities while within an image. In addition, the trompe l'oeil gains the freeze universal monster ability to appear as part of the painting. The trompe l'oeil can leave the painting as a move action. Once it leaves the painting, the image immediately reverts to the appearance it had before the trompe l'oeil entered. If someone destroys or damages the painting, the trompe l'oeil is unharmed, but exits the image.</p>\n<h1>TROMPE L'OEIL CANVASES</h1>\n<p>A trompe l'oeil remains magically connected to the surface on which it was painted. Unless its canvas is destroyed, a trompe l'oeil can rejuvenate after it is killed. Although most trompe l'oeils are painted on large canvases, any solid surface can serve as the \"canvas\" for a trompe l'oeil. If the trompe l'oeil is painted on a wall, only the surface must be destroyed to prevent the creature from rejuvenating. The canvas is enhanced by its connection to the trompe l'oeil. It has a hardness equal to the trompe l'oeil's HD (maximum 20) or the material's hardness, whichever is higher. It has hit points equal to half the trompe l'oeil's maximum hit points. Its dimensions must be at least as tall and wide as the trompe l'oeil itself.</p>\n<h1>CONSTRUCTION</h1>\n<p>A trompe l'oeil is created from a masterwork painting of the base creature, with a cost varying on the size of the subject.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Trompe l'Oeil Size</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Cost of Painting</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tiny or smaller</td>\n<td>500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Small</td>\n<td>1,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>2,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>3,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>4,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>6,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Colossal</td>\n<td>8,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1>TROMPE L'OEIL</h1>\n<p><strong><strong>CL</strong> </strong>varies (equal to the trompe l'oeil's HD); <strong>Price </strong>varies (100 gp per HD plus cost of painting)</p>\n<p>CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p><strong>COST </strong>500 gp per HD plus cost of painting</p>\n<p>Craft Construct, <em>animate objects</em>, <em>enter image</em>(APG); <strong>Skill </strong>Craft (painting)</p>\n<p>^Bestiary Horrific Inspirations</p>"}

Ambitious and cunning in their pursuit of land and glory, once dread lords attain their goals of conquest, they transition into tragic figures. They might find themselves hollow once their dreams are fulfilled, having nothing else to strive for, or could becoming heartless toward their charges, seeing them as ungrateful for all the lord sacrificed.</p>\n<p>Some lords come into power through vile deeds and become targets of powerful curses wreaked by people they wronged or powerful divine entities that demand retribution. These despicable creatures are transformed into brooding immortals known as cursed lords. Regardless of how they rose to rule over their lands, their dark domains are dangerous and haunted places, as described beginning on page 159.</p>\n<h1>CREATING A DREAD LORD</h1>\n<p>\"Dread lord\" is an acquired or inherited template that can be added to any creature with Intelligence and Charisma scores of at least 6 (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A dread lord uses the base creature's statistics and abilities except as noted here. If the creature is imprisoned within its domain as the result of a powerful curse, it instead becomes a cursed lord (see page 235).</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Rating</strong>: Base creature's CR + 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Senses</strong>: A dread lord gains darkvision 120 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities</strong>: A dread lord gains DR 5/good or silver. A dread lord gains fast healing 5 if it has fewer than 10 Hit Dice, or fast healing 10 if it has 10 or more Hit Dice.</p>\n<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: A dread lord gains the following weakness.</p>\n<p><em>Landlocked (Ex)</em>: A dread lord's power is drawn directly from its domain, which has a radius of 5 miles per Hit Die of the dread lord, centered on a fixed point of some significance to the dread lord. The dread lord loses all benefits of this template when not within its domain.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks</strong>: A dread lord gains several special attacks. For every 3 Hit Dice the dread lord has, it chooses a special attack from those listed below. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DCs for these abilities are equal to 10 + 1/2 the dread lord's Hit Dice + its Charisma modifier. The dread lord's caster level is equal to its total Hit Dice (or the caster level of its existing spell-like abilities, whichever is higher).</p>\n<p><em>All-Seeing (Sp)</em>: Nothing happens in the dread lord's realm without the dread lord becoming aware. It can use <em>speak with animals</em>, <em>speak with plants</em>, and <em>stone tell </em>as spell-like abilities each three times per day. If it has a CR of 5 or higher, it can use <em>clairaudience/clairvoyance </em>as a spell-like ability three times per day, and the spell's range extends to any place in its domain.</p>\n<p><em>Dream Dominion (Su)</em>: The dread lord has dominion over even the dreams of its subjects. It can use <em>dream </em>and <em>nightmare </em>as spell-like abilities, each once per day, but targeting only creatures within its domain. If it has a CR of 9 or higher, then once per week it can attempt to gain control of a creature whose dreams it affects in this way. If the target fails a secondary Will saving throw, the dread lord enslaves it, as per <em>dominate monster</em>, in addition to the <em>dream </em>or <em>nightmare </em>spell-like ability's normal effects.</p>\n<p><em>Fear aura (Su)</em>: The dread lord is terrifying to behold. Any creature within a 60-foot radius that sees or hears the dread lord must succeed at a Will save or be shaken for as long as it is within the aura, and for 1 minute thereafter. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same dread lord's fear aura for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>\n<p><em>Magical Mastery (Su)</em>: The dread lord draws magical power from its domain. It treats its caster level as 2 higher for the purposes of spells and spell-like abilities it casts, and the saving throw DCs of such spells and spell-like abilities increase by 1.</p>\n<p><em>Master of the Four Winds (Sp)</em>: The dread lord can control the weather within its domain. It can use <em>fog cloud </em>and <em>gust of wind </em>as spell-like abilities each three times per day. If it has a CR of 5 or higher, it can use <em>control weather </em>as a spell-like ability once per day. If it has a CR of 8 or higher, it can use <em>control winds </em>as a spell-like ability once per day.</p>\n<p><em>Physical Mastery (Su)</em>: The dread lord draws strength and deftness from its domain. It gains a +4 profane bonus to its Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores.</p>\n<p><em>Plant Affinity (Sp)</em>: The dread lord's control over its lands extends to the very plants. It can use <em>entangle </em>as a spell-like ability at will, and <em>plant growth </em>as a spell-like ability once per day. If it has a CR of 5 or higher, it can use <em>tree stride </em>as a spell-like ability at will. If it has a CR of 10 or higher, it can use <em>liveoak </em>as a spell-like ability once per day.</p>\n<p><em>Unquestioned Ruler (Sp)</em>: The dread lord's subjects naturally bend to its will. It can use <em>charm animal</em>, <em>charm person</em>, and <em>detect thoughts </em>as spell-like abilities at will. If it has a CR of 10 or higher, it can use <em>dominate animal</em>, <em>dominate person</em>, and <em>mass suggestion </em>as spell-like abilities three times per day.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Qualities</strong>: A dread lord gains the following special ability.</p>\n<p><em>One with the Land (Su)</em>: A dread lord can shape the hazardous landscapes formed as a consequence of its domain's creation to its will. It can replace any normal or supernatural hazard present in its domain with another hazard, but the process takes 24 hours, during which time neither hazard functions. The combined CR of all hazards found within a lord's domain (that is, the CR of a hypothetical encounter with all of the hazards at once) can't exceed twice its Hit Dice, and it cannot create any hazards whose CR exceeds its own. A dread lord's affinity with the land grants it a +2 bonus on all Will saves.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Scores</strong>: Intelligence +4, Charisma +4.</p>\n<h1>CURSED LORDS</h1>\n<p>Cursed lords gain dominion over their lands through evil deeds that result in powerful curses that trap them within their realms. They have all the abilities of dread lords, with the following additions and adjustments.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Rating</strong>: Base creature's CR + 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities</strong>: Cursed lords gain the following.</p>\n<p><em>Immortal Curse (Su)</em>: Even death can't free a cursed lord from its domain, and cursed lords that are killed return to life 24 hours later. When a cursed lord is created, a specific condition is determined by the source of the cursed lord's curse, which must be performed in order for the cursed lord to be permanently slain. The exact means vary with each cursed lord, are difficult but never impossible, and should be created specifically for each cursed lord by the GM. Examples include disinterring the corpse of the lord's slain lover and reburying it outside the domain, stealing vast treasures from the lord's castle and returning them to the poor people they were stolen from, or destroying a dam to set free a river the cursed lord has prevented from flowing through its lands.</p>\n<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: A cursed lord gains the following weakness.</p>\n<p><em>Trapped (Ex)</em>: A cursed lord is unable to leave its domain by any means, and effects such as <em>plane shift</em>, <em>shadow walk</em>, <em>teleport</em>, and even <em>wish </em>fail. If its domain is bordered by dread fog (see page 161), the mists inevitably guide the cursed lord back to its domain after 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Scores</strong>: Wisdom -4.</p>\n<p>^Bestiary Horrific Inspirations</p>"}

Chapter 1: Horror Characters","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<p>@Compendium[pf-content.horror-adventures.jsEW1pMN3Ds5FXmw]{(Index) Horror Adventures}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.horror-adventures.LvcaVxE3FjZKdLfz]{1.0. Chapter 1: Horror Characters}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>There is a sound pulsing through your blood, a call to the wild and savage places of the world, where you are free to hunt and to kill to satisfy your bloodlust. You are filled with the desire to rend foes limb from limb with tooth and claw.</p>\n<h1>CATALYST</h1>\n<p>Lycanthropy is contracted from being savagely wounded by the teeth or claws of a lycanthrope, typically when reduced to less than 10% of your maximum hit points in a single combat with one. (This can vary with the power of the creature.) When you contract this corruption, note the animal associated with the lycanthrope, as that is the kind if lycanthrope you will become.</p>\n<h1>Progression</h1>\n<p>Lycanthropy's progress is tied to the phases of the moon. Each month, the moon is considered full for three nights. At the onset of the corruption, you must attempt a Will saving throw during one of the nights chosen by the GM. For each stage of lycanthropy corruption you have, you must attempt a save on one additional night, eventually needing to save on nights leading up to and possibly after the full moon. The DC of this save is equal to 15 + your manifestation level. If you fail a save, you don't need to attempt more until the next full moon.</p>\n<p>Failing a saving throw against this corruption causes you to black out, losing control of your character. During this time, your form becomes that of the associated creature and you give into your animalistic urges, hunting and killing with abandon. The next morning, you regain control, typically in the wilderness without any gear and soaked in blood. If you fail the save but your inner animal is prevented from running free, perhaps because you were restrained, you transform and attempt to run free without a save on the remaining full moon nights, and you also go out of control any time you shift forms during the days of that full moon. If you last through it and remain restrained, your corruption doesn't progress to the next stage. However, the DC of the Will save against your corruption progressing increases by 2. These increases stack each time this occurs, and they last until your corruption reaches the next stage.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 1</strong>: The first time you lose control, you kill defenseless small animals, such as birds, rodents, and possibly even a dog.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 2</strong>: The second time this occurs, you kill larger animals, such as a horse, a cow, or a pig.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 3</strong>: The third time this happens, you kill a nearby sentient humanoid, at which point the corruption becomes incurable and you are doomed to live a life of lycanthropy, forever turning evil and becoming an NPC under the GM's control.</p>\n<h1>Removing the Corruption</h1>\n<p>Removing lycanthropy requires you to slay the source of your corruption and, at the height of the next full moon, consume 1 dose of belladonna per 2 manifestation levels you have all at once. You must choose to fail the initial saving throw against the belladonna.</p>\n<h1>MANIFESTATIONS</h1>\n<p>The following are manifestations of the lycanthropy corruption.</p>\n<h1>Animalistic Health</h1>\n<p>You are hardier in your animal form.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Shift form*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Whenever you shift forms, you gain a +2 bonus to your Constitution score that lasts as long as you are in your shifted form. Hit points gained from this bonus are lost when you revert to your normal form.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You take a -2 penalty to your Charisma score.</p>\n<h1>Animalistic Might</h1>\n<p>You are stronger in your animal form.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Shift form*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Whenever you shift forms, you gain a +2 bonus to your Strength score that lasts as long as you're in your shifted form.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Whenever you shift form involuntarily, your body spasms and changes size, causing you to drop whatever you were holding and burst out of your other gear and clothing. Items that can stay on throughout this size change might not fall off, at the GM's discretion.</p>\n<h1>Feral Senses</h1>\n<p>You gain the senses of your animalistic side.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain low-light vision. At manifestation level 3rd, you gain the scent special ability if your lycanthrope animal type has the scent ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Creatures of the animal type (except those of your lycanthrope type) are unnerved by your lycanthropic presence, causing you to take a -2 penalty on Handle Animal and Ride skill checks. At manifestation level 3rd, these penalties change to -4.</p>\n<h1>Fur Armor</h1>\n<p>When in your shifted form, you gain a thick coat of fur.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Shift form*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Whenever you shift your form, your natural armor bonus increases by 1. At manifestation level 5th, your natural armor bonus instead increases by 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Whenever you shift form involuntarily, you shift as a free action but you spend your next round confused and must roll to determine your action. At manifestation level 5th, you are confused for 2 rounds instead. Immunities don't prevent this confusion, and you can't remove the confusion early by any means.</p>\n<h1>Greater Shift Form</h1>\n<p>You can become an animal.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 6th, shift form*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: When you use shift form, you can instead take your animal form, as if using <em>polymorph</em>. Nonmagical clothing and gear don't meld into your animal form. You don't gain any ability score adjustments (other than those gained from other manifestations), but you do gain all of the other abilities granted by <em>polymorph </em>for your new form.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: While you're shifted, you're treated as a lycanthrope and shapeshifter for abilities, items, or spells that target lycanthropes or shapeshifters. In addition, when you shift involuntarily, you can't shift back until you spend a full-round action and succeed at a DC 20 Constitution check.</p>\n<p>If you don't succeed, you remain in your shifted form, automatically consuming a daily use of shifting each minute until you have used up all of your uses for the day.</p>\n<h1>Lunar Call</h1>\n<p>The moon's light affects your mind.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Shift form*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Whenever you are outside and the moon is visible, you gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls. These bonuses double during a full moon.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Whenever you are outside and the moon is visible, you take a -2 penalty on saving throws against emotion effects and a -4 penalty on saving throws to resist involuntarily shifting. These penalties double during a full moon.</p>\n<h1>Lycanthropic Empathy</h1>\n<p>You can relate to the creatures that share your type.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You can communicate with animals related to your animal type. You can use Diplomacy to alter such animals' attitudes, and you gain a +4 racial bonus on such checks. This bonus also applies on your wild empathy checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Your animalistic nature imposes a penalty on your Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive skill checks equal to your manifestation level (minimum -2) when dealing with humanoids (and other civilized folk at the GM's discretion).</p>\n<h1>Shift Form</h1>\n<p>You have some control over your shift to a feral nature.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You can attempt a DC 15 Constitution check as a full-round action to shift into a feral form, with a bonus equal to your manifestation level. This form grants you a bite natural attack that deals 1d6 points of piercing damage if you're Medium (1d4 if Small). You retain the use of your abilities and gear. You can remain in this form for up to 1 minute, but can revert back as a move action at any time. If the duration expires, you can extend it by 1 minute by spending another use of this ability as a free action. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your manifestation level.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: When you are struck by a confirmed critical hit and aren't in your shifted form, you must attempt a Will save (DC = 15 + your manifestation level). If you fail, you automatically shift form on your next turn without attempting a check. This consumes one use of that ability. You must also attempt this save if you take damage equal to or greater than your manifestation level while not in combat or before you've acted in combat.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: Upon receiving this manifestation, you must take both the gift and the stain, even with the useful corruption or vile corruption variants (see page 14).</p>\n<h1>Silver Allergy</h1>\n<p>You're resistant to harm, but can't abide the touch of silver.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 4th, shift form*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: When you are shifted, you gain an amount of damage reduction equal to half your manifestation level. This DR is overcome by silver.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: When you're not in your shifted form and you touch silver, including being struck by a silver weapon, you're sickened for 1 round. Immunities don't prevent this sickened condition, and you can't remove it early. You can try to hide this aversion with a Bluff check opposed by Sense Motive.</p>"}

This bonus increases to +2 at 5th level and +3 at 8th level. At 11th level, a cult hunter who fails a saving throw against a compulsion or poison can expend 1 use of his inspiration to reroll the saving throw (and his inspiration die, if added to the save). He must accept the result of this second roll, even if it is worse.</p><p>This ability replaces poison resistance and poison immunity.</p><p><b>Student of the Beyond (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, a cult hunter gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his class level on Knowledge and Spellcraft checks made to recognize any calling and summoning spells, portals, rifts, and planar travel.</p><p>This ability replaces poison lore.</p><p><b>Ambush Defenses (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, a cult hunter gains a +1 insight bonus during a surprise round triggered by his enemies on Reflex saves and to his AC. This bonus increases by 1 for every 3 investigator levels beyond 3rd.</p><p>This ability replaces trap sense.</p><p><b>Cultic Study (Ex)</b>: A cult hunter can spend 8 hours studying a specific deity or religion to gain a +1 bonus on Bluff, Intimidate, Knowledge, Perception, and Sense Motive checks against followers of that deity or religion and against extraplanar creatures. These bonuses increase by 1 for every 4 investigator levels beyond 4th. If he studies a new deity or religion, the bonuses replace the former bonuses.</p><p>This ability replaces swift alchemy.</p><p><b>Cult Combat (Ex)</b>: A cult hunter's bonuses on attack and damage rolls when using studied combat increase by 1 against followers of the cult he chose with his cultic study ability and decrease by 1 against other targets.</p><p>This ability alters studied combat.</p><p><b>Cult Strike (Ex)</b>: A cult hunter's studied strike uses d8s for the bonus damage against targets that belong to the cult he's studied. Against other targets, his studied strike uses d4s for the bonus damage.</p><p>This ability alters studied strike.</p><p><b>Summoning Sense (Su)</b>: At 7th level, a cult hunter gains the benefits of uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge against summoned creatures.</p><p>This ability replaces the 7th-level investigator talent.</p><p><b>Extraplanar Expulsion (Sp)</b>: At 13th level, a cult hunter can grant himself the ability to use <i>dispel chaos</i>, <i>dispel evil</i>, <i>dispel good</i>, or <i>dispel law </i>as a spell-like ability (using his investigator level as his caster level and his Intelligence to determine the DCs) by sacrificing an unused 5th- or 6th-level extract for the day. He is able to use this ability as many times as he likes, but only so long as he continues to have unused 5th-or 6th-level extract slots to expend.</p><p>This replaces the 13th-level investigator talent.</p><h1>Gravedigger (ARCHETYPE)</h1></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><p>Gravediggers pursue long-buried mysteries, figuratively and literally digging up the truth and finding answers to secrets only moldering corpses and dry bones can tell.</p><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: A gravedigger is proficient with simple weapons and scythes, and can fight with gravediggers' tools such as a shovel or lantern as if she had the Catch Off-Guard feat. A gravedigger is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p><p>This replaces the investigator's weapon and armor proficiencies.</p><p><b>Limited Alchemy</b>: A gravedigger prepares and uses extracts as an investigator but gains no other benefits of the alchemy ability. This also means that a gravedigger can't take the alchemist discovery investigator talent or any discovery that affects or involves alchemy.</p><p>This alters alchemy and investigator talents.</p></text><text type=\"formattedtext\"><p><b>Grave Magic (Sp)</b>: A gravedigger can sacrifice unused extract slots of the level given below or higher to use the following spells as spell-like abilities, using her investigator level as her caster level and her Intelligence to determine DCs: 1st-<i>expeditious excavation</i>(APG); 2nd-<i>calm spirit</i>(OA); 3rd-<i>speak with dead</i>; 4th- <i>rest eternal</i>(APG); 5th-<i>call spirit</i>(OA); 6th-<i>undeath to death.</i></p><p><b>Relic Focus (Su)</b>: A gravedigger can form a psychic bond with a skull or bone that she has personally exhumed or recovered from a burial site, using it as an occultist necromancy implement (<i>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures </i>47) and gaining its base focus power. The gravedigger cannot invest mental focus into the implement and thus doesn't receive any resonant powers. However, once per day she can expend one use of inspiration to use any focus power she knows that has a cost of 1 point of mental focus (<i>Occult Adventures </i>47). She can do this an additional time each day at 3rd level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter. To activate a focus power that costs more than 1 point of mental focus, the gravedigger can expend that number of daily uses of this ability (as well as uses of inspiration) at the same time. In addition, any number of times per day, she can expend 1 use of inspiration to use <i>grave words</i>(OA) as spell-like ability.</p><p>This ability replaces trapfinding and trap sense.</p><p><b>Deny Death (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, a gravedigger gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against death effects and energy drain. This increases to +4 at 5th level, to +6 at 8th level, and to +8 at 11th level.</p><p>This ability replaces the investigator's poison resistance and poison immunity.</p><p><b>Read the Bones (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, a gravedigger can perform object reading as an occultist (<i>Occult Adventures </i>48), but only on corpses, bones, and other physical remains.</p><p>This ability replaces poison lore.</p><p><b>Focus Talent (Su)</b>: A gravedigger can select a focus power for one of her implements as per an occultist of her investigator level in place of an investigator talent.</p><p>This ability alters investigator talents.</p><p><b>Kill the Dead (Ex)</b>: A gravedigger focuses on battling the undead, and her studied combat and studied strike function as if she were 2 levels lower against creatures other than undead (this means she can't use them at all against such creatures until 6th level).</p><p>This ability alters the investigator's studied combat and studied strike.</p><p><b>Grave Lamp (Su)</b>: At 4th level, a gravedigger can form a psychic bond with a lantern, using it as a conjuration implement in much the same way as she uses her relic focus as a necromancy implement. She can expend inspiration to fuel her grave lamp's focus powers the same number of times each day as she can for her relic focus (for example, a 6th-level gravedigger with 6 points of inspiration could expend up to three uses of inspiration as mental focus for her relic focus and up to three uses of inspiration as mental focus for her grave lamp).</p><p>This ability replaces swift alchemy.</p><h1>Profiler (ARCHETYPE)</h1><p>Profilers understand the human psyche to an intense degree, allowing them to predict the criminals they hunt.</p><p><b>Expert Profiler (Ex)</b>: A profiler gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his class level (minimum +1) on Sense Motive checks. At 2nd level, he can use inspiration on any Sense Motive check without expending a use of inspiration, provided he is trained in the skill.</p><p>At 3rd level, he can attempt to predict a creature's movements using his knowledge of the creature's psychology. He can use this ability only on a creature familiar to him (for example, a serial killer whose crimes the profiler has studied will suffice, even if the profiler hasn't yet identified the serial killer's true identity). To do so, he starts from a place where he knows that the creature has been and why (most often the scene of a crime) and attempts a Sense Motive check against a DC equal to 40 or to 20 + the creature's Bluff modifier, whichever is higher, which the GM rolls in secret. On a failure, the profiler's guess about the creatures movements is inaccurate. On a success, the profiler is able to track the creature's general movements as if using Survival to track (though the usual modifiers on Survival checks to track don't apply, and this ability allows her to track a creature using <i>pass without trace </i>or otherwise leaving no trail). After at most 1 hour (or sooner if there are many possible options for the creature to take, at the GM's discretion), if the profiler has not yet found further evidence of the creature's passing (such as footprints, fingerprints, or any other indication that the creature came this way), he loses track of the creature's movements; if he does, he can try to guess where the creature went next by attempting another check.</p><p>This ability replaces trapfinding, poison lore, and trap sense.</p><p><b>Divination Analysis (Su)</b>: At 2nd level, a profiler has analyzed the workings of the mind. His caster level to determine the duration of his divination extracts increases by 1, and he gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against divinations. The increases to caster level and bonus on saving throws increase by 1 at 5th level and by another 1 at 8th level. At 11th level, a profiler can expend one use of inspiration to add 1d6 to the result of a concentration check when using a divination extract or investigator spell-like ability.</p><p>This ability replaces poison resistance and poison immunity.</p><p><b>Blood Sleuth (Sp)</b>: At 4th level, a profiler can expend one use of his inspiration to use <i>discern next of kin</i>(ACG) as a spell-like ability. Alternatively, he can expend two uses of inspiration to use <i>blood biography</i>(APG) as a spell-like ability.</p><p>This ability replaces swift alchemy.</p><p><b>Pack Psychology (Su)</b>: At 7th level, a profiler can understand the way that groups act together, allowing him to exploit the vulnerabilities in their attacks. A profiler can't be flanked by creatures with an Intelligence score and he gains a +1 bonus to his AC against such creatures when they would otherwise flank him, as he plays their movements against each other.</p><p>This ability replaces the investigator talent at 7th level.</p></text>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter2archetypesandclassoptions\">^Archetypes and Class Options</text>\n            <text2 type=\"formattedtext\"><link type=\"windowreference\" class=\"referencemanualpage\" recordname=\"reference.refmanualdata.refpage_chapter3feats\">Feats</text2>\n            <text type=\"formattedtext\"></text>\n            ","_id":"AJtVSHXvMXglY8aI"}

Do not recalculate Hit Dice, BAB, or saves. It gains the augmented subtype.</p>\n<p><strong>Senses</strong>: An apostle kyton gains darkvision 60 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class</strong>: Natural armor bonus increases by 4.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities</strong>: An apostle kyton gains immunity to cold, spell resistance equal to 11 + its total CR, and regeneration equal to 1/2 its Hit Dice that is negated by good weapons, good spells, and silver weapons.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks</strong>: An apostle kyton gains the following special attacks.</p>\n<p><em>Agonizing Prayer (Su)</em>: As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, an apostle kyton can orate a prayer so profane that it causes any non-kyton listening to erupt in bleeding wounds. Any non-kyton listener must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the apostle kyton's Hit Dice + its Charisma modifier) or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per Hit Die of the apostle kyton, take bleed damage as if struck by the apostle kyton's bleeding touch, and become staggered for 1 round. Creatures that succeed on this save halve the nonlethal damage and negate the staggered effect, but they still take the bleed damage. A creature that has taken nonlethal damage greater than or equal to its current hit points is not normally rendered unconscious by this ability, but such a creature is still helpless, rendering it susceptible to the apostle kyton's seductive oration ability. This is a sonic pain(UM) effect.</p>\n<p><em>Bleeding Touch (Su)</em>: An apostle kyton that touches a creature deals 1 point of damage plus 1d6 points of bleed damage for every 10 Hit Dice of the kyton. If an apostle kyton attacks with natural or manufactured weapons, its weapons also deal this bleed damage.</p>\n<p><em>Seductive Oration (Su)</em>: An apostle kyton has a unique perspective due to her transition into her current form. As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, an apostle kyton can speak to the pleasures and wonders it experienced during its transformation. Any creature that listens to this speech for 1 continuous minute must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the apostle kyton's Hit Dice + the apostle kyton's Charisma modifier) or take 1d6 points of Wisdom damage. This Wisdom damage increases by 1d6 for every 8 Hit Dice of the apostle kyton. A creature that succeeds at its save can't be affected by that apostle kyton's seductive oration ability for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>After failing the save to resist the apostle kyton's seductive oration, the target begins to question the definitions of morality, physicality, and life.</p>\n<p>Once per week, as long as the affected creature remains in communication with the apostle kyton, it must attempt a saving throw against seductive oration again or have its alignment shift one step toward lawful evil and take 1d6 additional points of Wisdom damage.</p>\n<p>The save DC increases by 1 per consecutive week of contact with the apostle kyton. A successful save prevents the alignment shift. A creature can't take Wisdom damage from seductive oration more than once per week, even if it encounters multiple apostle kytons.</p>\n<p>When the target's alignment completely shifts to lawful evil (or if the target is lawful evil when first seduced), the target must immediately succeed at a Will save (with the same DC as seductive oration, including any increases from extended contact) or gain a greater madness (see page 182).</p>\n<p>If your campaign uses the sanity system (see page 12), then instead of dealing Wisdom damage, seductive oration deals sanity damage equal to 1/2 the apostle kyton's CR. If the target is turned lawful evil, the greater madness it gains is in addition to any madness it might gain from the sanity damage itself.</p>\n<p>Creatures that are driven insane by an apostle kyton often eventually become broken souls (<em>Bestiary 4 </em>24), but some rare individuals gain the shadowbound corruption (see page 34) or even transform into apostle kytons themselves.</p>\n<p><em>Unnerving Gaze (Su)</em>: An apostle kyton's unnerving gaze (see the kyton subtype) causes those who fail their saving throws to be fascinated by the apostle kyton. The apostle kyton's seductive oration doesn't break this fascination effect, but other attacks break the effect as normal.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell-Like Abilities</strong>: An apostle kyton of 11 Hit Dice or higher can cast <em>shadow walk </em>once per day, with a caster level equal to her Hit Dice. An apostle kyton of 20 Hit Dice or higher can use <em>shadow walk </em>at will.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Qualities</strong>: An apostle kyton gains the following.</p>\n<p><em>Shadow Traveler (Su)</em>: When an apostle kyton uses <em>shadow walk</em>, she moves at 100 miles per hour.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Scores</strong>: Strength +6, Dexterity +4, Constitution +6, Intelligence +2, Wisdom +6, Charisma +6.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills</strong>: An apostle kyton gains a +4 racial bonus on Bluff, Heal, and Intimidate checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong>: An apostle kyton learns Infernal as a bonus language.</p>\n<p>^Bestiary Horrific Inspirations</p>"}

Chapter 1: Horror Characters","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<p>@Compendium[pf-content.horror-adventures.jsEW1pMN3Ds5FXmw]{(Index) Horror Adventures}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.horror-adventures.LvcaVxE3FjZKdLfz]{1.0. Chapter 1: Horror Characters}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Whether it's an actual spirit or an alternate personality, another mind vies with you for control of your body.</p>\n<h1>CATALYST</h1>\n<p>An evil spirit, soul, or personality-hereafter referred to as a spirit-has taken up residence within your body.</p>\n<h1>Progression</h1>\n<p>The corruption progresses when you give up control to use the spirit's power. Like a medium's spirits (<em>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures </em>30), the spirit possessing you can give you more power when you give it influence (this doesn't interact with medium spirits; the influence is separate). Each day at sunrise, the number of points of influence the spirit has over you returns to 1. The spirit gains 1 point of influence whenever you fall asleep (or perform your daily rest) or become confused, dazed, frightened, panicked, or stunned. You lose any immunity to confusion, daze, fear, and stun.</p>\n<p>When the spirit has at least 3 points of influence, you have visible difficulty controlling your body, and you shift back and forth between your own personality and a blend with the spirit. When the spirit has 5 points of influence, you must attempt a Will save (DC = 15 + your manifestation level). If you succeed, influence drops to 4 points; otherwise, the corruption progresses to the next stage. If you must attempt this saving throw again before the next sunrise, the DC increases by 2 for every previous attempt.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 1</strong>: The first time you fail, you move one step closer to the spirit's alignment (GM's choice) and the spirit controls your actions until the next sunrise.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 2</strong>: The second time you fail, your alignment changes to match the spirit's, the spirit controls your actions until the next sunrise, and you have lapses of control and personality regardless of influence.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 3</strong>: The third time you fail the saving throw, the spirit steals full control of your body and you become an NPC under the GM's control. This NPC has the possessed corruption with you as the possessing spirit.</p>\n<h1>Removing the Corruption</h1>\n<p>Ending a possession corruption usually requires you to be targeted with <em>dispel evil </em>or <em>cast out</em>(APG) while you stand inside a <em>magic circle against evil </em>turned inward as a trap. The spirit uses your Will save modifier without any of your penalties, and its effective caster level is equal to your character level + your possessed manifestation level.</p>\n<p>However, since the method of possession varies from case to case, a particular possession might require other means of removal, such as undergoing therapy or fulfilling the spirit's unfinished business.</p>\n<h1>MANIFESTATIONS</h1>\n<p>The following are manifestations of the possessed corruption.</p>\n<h1>Blurred Soul</h1>\n<p>The possessing spirit confounds targeted magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Manifestation level 5th.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Spells that affect a limited number of targets can fail when targeting you unless the caster selects you as two separate targets. Against such spells that target you only once, you have an amount of spell resistance equal to 11 + double your manifestation level. A spellcaster who finishes casting a spell that targets you only once and succeeds at a caster level check against your spell resistance notices the interference and can attempt a DC 25 Spellcraft check to realize she needs to target you twice to circumvent it with future spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You cringe from symbols of benevolent magic. Any ally attempting to cast a touch spell on you must succeed at a touch attack. You can spend a move action steadying yourself to allow allies to touch you without a touch attack for 1 round. If the spirit has 3 or more points of influence over you, you must attempt saving throws against harmless spells cast by allies (but not yourself ), and you no longer count as willing.</p>\n<h1>Contaminated Personality</h1>\n<p>Your mind fractures in the struggle against the spirit.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Manifestation level 4th.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain a +2 bonus to your Charisma score while the possessing spirit has 4 or more points of influence over you.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You adopt the spirit's mannerisms, disturbing others and making it harder to disguise the possession. You take a -4 penalty on Diplomacy and Disguise checks.</p>\n<h1>Hateful Voices</h1>\n<p>Paranoid whispers constantly mingle with your own thoughts.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain a +4 bonus on Perception checks and Sense Motive checks to see through disguises, notice when a creature is under an enchantment, and act on the surprise round.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Whenever a character you consider an ally or friend betrays or disappoints you, even if the disappointment is completely innocent, you unknowingly mutter (Perception DC 15 for others to hear) about how that character was an enemy all along and must be made to pay. As long as the spirit has 3 or more points of influence, you gain no benefit from another creature's aid another attempts.</p>\n<h1>Temporary Clarity</h1>\n<p>You channel all your negative emotions into the spirit.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Once per day, without spending an action, you can sublimate all of your negative thoughts into the spirit to clear your mind in response to gaining one of the following conditions: dazed, frightened, panicked, shaken, staggered, and stunned. You ignore the effects of that particular instance of that condition for a number of minutes equal to your manifestation level (if you suffer from that condition from another source, it applies normally). This time still counts against the condition's duration. Once the duration expires, the possessing spirit gains 1 point of influence over you.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You make the spirit more powerful by feeding it your darkest thoughts. Whenever you fall asleep (or perform your daily rest), the spirit gains 2 points of influence over you rather than 1 point, and at sunrise, the number of points of influence the spirit has over you changes to 2.</p>\n<h1>Traitorous Hand</h1>\n<p>The spirit focuses on one hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: A number of times per day equal to your manifestation level, you can use traitorous hand to make a touch attack that confounds foes with the spirit's influence. The target is nauseated for 1 round per point of influence the spirit has over you (Will negates). Even if the target succeeds, it can't make attacks of opportunity for 1 round. A creature affected by this ability becomes immune for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You take a -2 penalty on attack rolls and Dexterity-based checks involving your hands. Whenever you become dazed or stunned, if the spirit has 3 or more points of influence over you after adding the point, the hand attacks you (or a vulnerable ally, GM's discretion) with a held item or unarmed strike as if proficient, dealing damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier (regardless of the held item).</p>\n<h1>Two Minds</h1>\n<p>The spirit suffers no rivals.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: The extra mind provides a reserve of willpower against mental attacks. You gain a +2 bonus on saves against mind-affecting effects; if you fail, you can give the spirit 1 point of influence over you to reroll the save without using an action. If you do, you must accept the result of the second roll and can't reroll. These benefits don't apply against this corruption.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: A cacophony of thoughts distracts you. Roll twice on initiative checks and take the lower result. You also take a -2 penalty on concentration checks. At manifestation level 3rd, the penalty changes to -4.</p>\n<h1>Unrestrained</h1>\n<p>The spirit resists physical restraint.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain a +2 bonus on Acrobatics, Climb, Fly, and Swim checks. You can give the spirit 1 point of influence as a swift action to gain the benefits of <em>freedom of movement </em>for 1 round. At manifestation level 3rd, the bonuses increase to +4.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Objects you wear and carry slip from your grasp and fall from your pockets, or suddenly pelt creatures that have acted in an unhelpful manner toward you. It takes you a standard action to retrieve a stored item, and whenever you drop or lose hold of an item, it lands 10 feet away in a random direction. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws and to your CMD against attacks and effects that would disarm you or steal from you. At manifestation level 3rd, the penalty changes to -4.</p>\n<h1>Violent Will</h1>\n<p>The spirit uses your body as a conduit to unleash forceful energy.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 5th, unrestrained*, weightlessness*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You can give the possessing spirit 1 point of influence over you to use <em>telekinesis </em>(as per the spell) with a caster level equal to your character level.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Whenever you become confused, dazed, frightened, panicked, or stunned, the possessing spirit blames your allies for failing you. It unleashes a forceful version of <em>telekinesis </em>at your nearest ally, either hurling the largest possible nearby object at her or, if there are no objects to hurl, hurling the ally against a hard surface.</p>\n<h1>Weightlessness</h1>\n<p>The possessing spirit's influence causes you to nearly float.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Unrestrained*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You can use <em>feather fall </em>and <em>jump </em>at will as spell-like abilities. You can give the possessing spirit 1 point of influence over you to use <em>levitate </em>or <em>spider climb </em>as a spell-like ability. In all cases, your caster level is equal to your character level and the spell-like ability can target only you.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You take a -4 penalty on saving throws and to your CMD against attacks and effects that would move or trip you, as well as on all combat maneuver checks except those made to escape a grapple. At manifestation level 3rd, the penalty changes to -6.</p>"}

Chapter 3: Feats","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<p>@Compendium[pf-content.horror-adventures.jsEW1pMN3Ds5FXmw]{(Index) Horror Adventures}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.horror-adventures.xN3E803SapL8JQ6v]{3.0. Chapter 3: Feats}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Though many of the feats presented in this chapter are general and have no special rules governing them, some feats belong to a type or types of feats that share special rules. A feat's types appear in parentheses after the feat's name. This chapter features the following types of feats.</p>\n<h1>Combat Feats</h1>\n<p>Members of some classes can select combat feats as bonus feats. Members of other classes can take combat feats if they meet the prerequisites.</p>\n<h1>Item Creation Feats</h1>\n<p>Item creation feats allow characters to create particular magic items. See pages 548-549 of the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook </em>for more details.</p>\n<h1>Metamagic Feats</h1>\n<p>Metamagic feats allow spellcasters to modify and change their spells, granting the spells new powers and effects. Such spells generally take up a higher-level spell slot than the normal spell. For complete rules on how to apply metamagic feats to spells, see page 112 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>.</p>\n<h1>Monster Feats</h1>\n<p>Monster feats were introduced in <em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em>, though without a separate tag (all feats in <em>Bestiary </em>are monster feats except Craft Construct). Most of these feats apply specifically to monsters and might grant abilities that could be disruptive in the hands of PCs, although with the GM's permission PCs can take one of these feats if they meet the prerequisites.</p>\n<p>Some monster feats allow a creature to apply metamagic feat-like effects to its spell-like abilities. You can select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 the monster's caster level (round down) - 1 or 2, depending on the ability. Table 3-1: Metamagic Spell-Like Abilities summarizes these feats and what spell-like abilities they can affect by caster level.</p>\n<h1>Story Feats</h1>\n<p>Story feats were first introduced in <em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign. </em>A story feat reflects a goal-often an all-consuming one-that shapes your life. Each story feat incorporates a trigger event (which comes from either a campaign occurrence or your background), an immediate benefit, a goal, and a further benefit for achieving that goal.</p>\n<p>Most story feat bonuses are untyped and stack with almost any other bonus. However, if you have multiple story feats, their untyped bonuses do not stack with each other. For example, if two story feats gave you a bonus on saving throws, you would add only the higher bonus.</p>\n<p>Many story feats share similar terminology in their prerequisites and completion conditions. The following terms have special meanings when used in story feats.</p>\n<p><strong>Appropriate Number</strong>: These are either creatures whose individual CRs add up to 20, or creatures whose individual CRs add up to 5 times your character level, whichever is greater. For example, an appropriate number of creatures for a 6th-level character have CRs that total 30. This calculation is based on your current character level, not the level at which you selected the story feat. Easily defeated opponents (those with CRs of 3 or more below your character level) don't count unless circumstances make them much more difficult to handle.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenging Foe</strong>: This is a foe or group of foes with a total CR of 10 or a CR of 3 plus your character level, whichever is higher. If this refers to a distinct individual, the foe's CR is set when the feat is taken, but the foe advances in power as you do. Otherwise, it refers to your current level, not the level at which you selected the story feat. A typical challenging foe advances in CR by 1 for every level you gain.</p>\n<p><strong>Character's Level</strong>: Normally, this is your actual character level. If playing a creature best represented by CR rather than character level (such as most monsters with more than 1 HD), use your calculated CR instead of your character level.</p>\n<p><strong>Decisively Defeat</strong>: You overcome a foe in some way, such as by killing the creature, knocking it unconscious, or causing it to be taken prisoner. You must be a significant participant in the conflict to defeat the opponent, even if another strikes the final blow. Whether or not merely causing the enemy to flee qualifies is up to the GM. Generally, driving off an enemy while causing little permanent harm does not qualify as a decisive defeat.</p>\n<p><strong>Slay</strong>: Slaying a foe includes killing it, destroying it, turning it to stone, banishing it to the Abyss (assuming it can't easily return), or otherwise eliminating it in a fashion reversible only by powerful magic. Unless otherwise noted, you must deal the final blow yourself to slay a creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Thwart</strong>: Distinct from defeating a foe, thwarting a foe involves disrupting its plans in a substantial and essentially permanent fashion. Deposing a lord, bringing down a priest's temple, or disrupting a cultist's one-time-only ritual and exposing her secret cult all qualify as thwarting. You keep any benefits gained by thwarting a foe even if it survives defeat and returns more powerful than before. You must be a significant participant in the events that lead to your foe being thwarted for your actions to count toward fulfilling a story requirement.</p>\n<h1>Style Feats</h1>\n<p>Style feats were first introduced in <em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat</em>. The style feats presented in this chapter are fitting for creatures that delve into the depravities of horror.</p>\n<p>As a swift action, you can enter the stance employed by the fighting style that a style feat embodies. Although you cannot use a style feat before combat begins, the style you are in persists until you take a swift action to switch styles or the end of the combat encounter, whichever occurs first. You can use a feat that has a style feat as a prerequisite only while you are in the stance of the associated style.</p>\n<p>The styles presented in this book are listed below, along with associated combat feats that require the style feat as a prerequisite.</p>\n<p><strong>Brute Style</strong>: Adherents to this style emulate the destructive and overwhelming power of brutish creatures. This forceful style focuses on knocking opponents prone and then crushing them by treading heavily upon them.</p>\n<p><em>Feat Path</em>: Brute Style, Brute Stomp, Brute Assault.</p>\n<p><strong>Deadhand Style</strong>: Adherents to this style call to the restless and malevolent spirits of the dead to sow fear and bolster their own courage. Masters of this style learn to drain the life essence of their enemies, reducing them to desiccated husks.</p>\n<p><em>Feat Path</em>: Deadhand Style, Deadhand Initiate, Deadhand Master.</p>\n<p><strong>Kyton Style</strong>: Adherents to this style model themselves after kytons, and focus pain (and its inherent pleasures) into a strict, orderly discipline through which to channel their ki. They use a spiked chain as an instrument of control and defense.</p>\n<p><em>Feat Path</em>: Kyton Style, Kyton Shield, Kyton Cut.</p>\n<p><strong>Maddening Style</strong>: Adherents to this style channel the sanity-consuming power of the incomprehensible beings that dwell in the dark places between stars, and use these forces to defend against mental attacks and corrupt their opponents' bodies and minds.</p>\n<p><em>Feat Path</em>: Maddening Style, Maddening Strike, Maddening Obliteration.</p>"}

Chapter 2: Archetypes And Class Options}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In a world of horror, vigilantes might be society's secret guardians or the sociopathic monsters civilized folk fear.</p>\n<h1>Experimenter (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Some vigilantes adopt lives of secrecy to hide their strange experiments from public view.</p>\n<p><strong>Class Skills</strong>: An experimenter adds all Knowledge skills to his list of class skills.</p>\n<p>This alters the vigilante's class skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies</strong>: Experimenters aren't proficient with martial weapons, medium armor, or shields.</p>\n<p>This alters the vigilante's weapon and armor proficiencies.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbidden Science (Ex)</strong>: An experimenter gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his vigilante level on Craft (alchemy) checks to create alchemical items and on Knowledge (engineering) checks (minimum +1). He also learns how to craft a mutagen(APG) as if he were an alchemist of his class level. He can take alchemical discoveries in place of vigilante talents, but only discoveries that affect his mutagen (including cognatogen(UM) discoveries).</p>\n<p>When an experimenter is confused, dazed, frightened, panicked, or stunned, he must attempt a Will save (DC = 20 + his vigilante level) each round at the start of his turn. If he fails, he transforms as if he had consumed his mutagen (determine which ability score gets the bonus randomly). This doesn't consume his mutagen, and lasts a number of rounds equal to 3 + his vigilante level, after which the transformation ends and he becomes fatigued. While transformed in this way, he is confused, and he rerolls any result of \"act normally.\" Since the confusion is part of the mutagenic transformation, abilities that prevent or remove confusion don't apply to this effect, though abilities that end the effect of a mutagen work normally. He forgets everything that happened while he was involuntarily transformed.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces vigilante specialization.</p>\n<p><strong>Mutagenic Change (Ex)</strong>: As a full-round action, an experimenter can consume his mutagen (if he has one) and shift from his social identity to his vigilante identity, as if he had the quick change social talent.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces the 1st-level social talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Brew Potion</strong>: At 3rd level, an experimenter gains Brew Potion as a bonus feat. He treats his vigilante level as his caster level and can use Craft (alchemy) instead of Spellcraft to brew potions. He can use another potion of the same spell as a sample to provide the necessary spell without consuming the potion, increasing the DC by 5.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces unshakable.</p>\n<p><strong>Lore Master (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, an experimenter gains the lore master bard class feature.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces startling appearance.</p>\n<p><strong>Craft Construct</strong>: At 11th level, an experimenter gains Craft Construct as a bonus feat. He treats his vigilante level as his caster level and can use Knowledge (engineering) instead of Spellcraft to craft a construct.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces frightening appearance.</p>\n<p><strong>Mutable Mutagen (Su)</strong>: At 17th level, the duration of an experimenter's mutagen increases to 1 hour per level.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces stunning appearance.</p>\n<h1>Hangman (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Wherever the guilty walk free, the hangman brings judgment.</p>\n<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiencies</strong>: A hangman is proficient with nets and whips, but not shields.</p>\n<p>This alters the vigilante's weapon and armor proficiencies.</p>\n<p><strong>Vigilante Specialization</strong>: A hangman must choose the stalker specialization.</p>\n<p>This alters vigilante specialization.</p>\n<p><strong>Hangman's Noose (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a hangman can wield a rope noose as a net or whip, and also can use it to grapple, gaining the benefits of Improved Grapple with it. He takes no penalty on combat maneuver checks with the noose for having the noose in his hand, but he still doesn't add any bonuses he might have with a net or whip (such as weapon enhancement bonuses or benefits from Weapon Focus) on the check. He can spend 1 minute to weave a magical or masterwork net or whip into a noose, thereafter gaining these benefits with it.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces the 2nd-level vigilante talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Bound to Truth (Ex, Sp)</strong>: At 3rd level, a hangman adds half his vigilante level to his Sense Motive checks to notice lies told by a creature entangled or grappled by his noose, by feeling the creature's throat clench or changes in its breathing. In addition, he can prevent a creature entangled or grappled in his noose from lying by tightening the noose, as per a single-target <em>zone of truth </em>(the caster level equals his vigilante level; the save DC is Charisma-based). He can use the latter ability a number of rounds per day equal to half his vigilante level. These rounds don't need to be consecutive.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces unshakable.</p>\n<p><strong>Twisted Rope (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, a hangman can spend 1 hour preparing his noose, granting it temporary hit points equal to his vigilante level, giving it a hardness equal to 1/2 his vigilante level plus double the weapon's enhancement bonus (or its current hardness, whichever is better), and changing its break DC to 23 + 1/2 his vigilante level (or its current break DC, whichever is better). These benefits last for 8 hours, but end immediately if the hangman prepares another noose. This ability replaces the 4th-level vigilante talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Chokehold</strong>: At 5th level, a hangman gains Chokehold(UC) as a bonus feat.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces startling appearance.</p>\n<p><strong>Tighten the Noose (Ex)</strong>: At 11th level, while a hangman is grappling a target with his noose, as a swift action he can deal increased hidden strike damage to the target.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces frightening appearance.</p>\n<p><strong>Suffocation (Ex)</strong>: At 17th level, the first time the hangman succeeds at a check to maintain a grapple (on his next turn after establishing the grapple), in place of the other options, he can suffocate the target and cause her to fall unconscious. A successful Fortitude save (DC = 15 + the hangman's Strength bonus) negates the suffocation. On subsequent rounds, the hangman can maintain the grapple to suffocate the target again. On the next failed save, the target drops to -1 hit points and starts dying. On the third failed save, she dies. Even if the hangman has the ability to maintain a grapple with less than a standard action, he can attempt to maintain a grapple to suffocate only once per round.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces stunning appearance.</p>\n<h1>Serial Killer (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Some vigilantes adopt an innocent guise to cloak their acts of brutal murder.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: A serial killer's vigilante identity must be evil. A serial killer whose vigilante identity becomes nonevil cannot gain new levels as a vigilante but retains all of her class abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Vigilante Specialization</strong>: A serial killer must choose the stalker specialization. Her hidden strike is considered equivalent to a sneak attack with the same number of dice for the purpose of meeting prerequisites or using abilities that depend on sneak attack.</p>\n<p>This alters vigilante specialization.</p>\n<p><strong>Thwart Pursuit (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a serial killer adds 1/2 her vigilante level as a bonus on all checks in a chase (<em>Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide </em>232) and to the DCs of Diplomacy checks to gather information about her and checks to track her or notice her tracks (though not to the DC of the profiler's expert profiler ability; see page 55).</p>\n<p>This ability replaces unshakable.</p>\n<p><strong>Studied Target (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, a serial killer gains the studied target(ACG) ability of a slayer 3 levels lower, including the ability to study multiple targets simultaneously at the appropriate levels. The serial killer does not provoke attacks of opportunity when attempting a coup de grace against a studied target.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces the 4th- and 14th-level vigilante talents and the 9th- and 19th-level social talents.</p>\n<p><strong>Charming (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a serial killer gains the charm(APG) hex as if she were a witch of her vigilante level, but she can't affect animals. The DC is based on her Charisma, and the ability is nonmagical.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces startling appearance.</p>\n<p><strong>Death Attack (Ex)</strong>: At 6th level, a serial killer gains the ability to make a death attack as if she were an assassin (DC = 10 + 1/2 her vigilante level + her Charisma modifier).</p>\n<p>This ability replaces the 6th-level vigilante talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Calling Card (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level, when a serial killer slays a humanoid with a coup de grace or death attack, she can leave a telltale token or clue behind identifying this death as her work. The serial killer chooses her calling card when she gains this ability, and the first time she uses it in an area where she has renown (as per the renown social talent), it becomes associated with her killings. After that, once citizens of a new settlement find this calling card, the serial killer immediately establishes the settlement as an area of renown for her vigilante identity without spending additional time to spread tales, and the Intimidate bonus from renown increases by 2. She still must spend time to establish her social identity's renown.</p>\n<p>This replaces the 7th-level social talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Grisly Murder (Ex)</strong>: At 11th level, a serial killer gains Dreadful Carnage(APG) as a bonus feat, and if she leaves a calling card, the murder is so horrifying that creatures examining the corpse are affected as per <em>nightmare </em>that night (DC = 10 + 1/2 the serial killer's vigilante level + her Charisma modifier). The nightmare affects a number of creatures equal to the serial killer's Charisma modifier, starting with the first creature to examine the corpse.</p>\n<p>This replaces frightening appearance.</p>\n<p><strong>Quiet Death (Ex)</strong>: At 12th level, a serial killer gains the quiet death class feature as if she were an assassin.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces the 12th-level vigilante talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Swift Death (Ex)</strong>: At 17th level, a serial killer gains the swift death class feature as an assassin.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces the vigilante's stunning appearance.</p>\n<p>^Archetypes and Class Options Feats</p>"}

Chapter 5: Horror Rules}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Fractures, cuts, and abrasions wound the body, but madness undermines the mind, spirit, and personality. Suffering from madness can be terrifying, causing those afflicted to act contrary to their desires or reason.</p>\n<p>Madnesses are afflictions, similar in structure to poisons, diseases, and curses. They are used as part of the sanity system (see page 12) as an outcome of severe assaults on a character's sanity, but GMs can use madness in other cases as well. Because madnesses are presented as afflictions, they can be used with the sanity and madness system found on pages 250-251 of the <em>Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide</em>.</p>\n<p>If you're using the rules for sanity and madness in the <em>GameMastery Guide</em>, when those rules call for a character to gain an insanity, roll d%. The character gains a lesser madness on a roll of 1-70%, and a greater madness on a 71-100%. Once the potency of the madness is determined, roll on the appropriate table (Table 5-1 for a lesser madness and Table 5-2 for a greater madness) to determine the kind of madness the character gains, or select an appropriate madness that fits the situation.</p>\n<p>The madnesses in this section are works of fantasy. None are statements about or descriptions of existing maladies.</p>\n<h1>READING A MADNESS STAT BLOCK</h1>\n<p>Madnesses are formatted in the same way as other afflictions (<em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook </em>555), with the following changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Save</strong>: Unless the character has gained the madness via the sanity system (see page 12), this is the save necessary to avoid contracting the madness. It is also the base saving throw needed to cure the madness (see Curing Madness below) and the saving throw the effects of the madness require. If, during the course of treating a madness, the affliction's DC decreases, that new reduced saving throw also becomes the DC the afflicted character must succeed at to avoid any of the madness's effects. It's possible to suffer from multiple forms of the same madness. If a character becomes afflicted with a form of madness from which he is already suffering (even if it takes a slightly different form, such as phobias of different objects), the current DC of that madness increases by 5. All madnesses are mind-affecting effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Onset</strong>: When a character suffers madness from the sanity system (due to a sanity attack that deals sanity damage greater than or equal to his sanity edge), this onset time does not apply. Use this entry only when the character contracts the madness in other ways. During the onset time, the character gradually gains the madness effect, rather then suddenly experiencing the full effect after a number of days.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong>: This is the effect of the madness. An afflicted character typically suffers this effect at all times, but some madnesses manifest only during certain situations. For complex effects or effects that rely on roleplaying, the description section of the madness contains a more detailed description of the effect. If you're using the sanity system, this effect manifests as long as the madness is not dormant.</p>\n<p><strong>Dormancy Effect</strong>: If you're using the sanity system, the afflicted character suffers this effect while the madness is dormant. Otherwise, ignore this entry.</p>\n<h1>Table 6-1: Lesser Madness</h1>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><strong>d%</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Madness</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">1-10</td>\n<td colspan=\"6\">Delirium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">11-22</td>\n<td colspan=\"6\">Delusion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">23-32</td>\n<td colspan=\"6\">Fugue</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">33-42</td>\n<td colspan=\"6\">Hallucination</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">43-54</td>\n<td colspan=\"6\">Mania</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">55-66</td>\n<td colspan=\"6\">Melancholia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">67-76</td>\n<td colspan=\"6\">Night terrors</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">77-86</td>\n<td colspan=\"6\">Paranoia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">87-100</td>\n<td colspan=\"6\">Phobia</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-tables.066IdZWDHmtOeHbB]{Horror Adventures: Lesser Madness}</p>\n<h1>Table 6-2: Greater Madness</h1>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>d%</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Madness</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1-18</td>\n<td>Amnesia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19-30</td>\n<td>Catatonia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>31-48</td>\n<td>Cognitive block</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>49-66</td>\n<td>Disassociated identity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>67-78</td>\n<td>Psychopathy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>79-85</td>\n<td>Psychosomatic loss</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>86-100</td>\n<td>Schizophrenia</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-tables.h2xqOd1UeqKjZtsz]{Horror Adventures: Greater Madness}</p>\n<h1>CURING MADNESS</h1>\n<p>Each madness has a DC representing its strength. Among other things, that DC specifies the saving throw the afflicted character must succeed at to recover from the madness. Recovering from a madness without magical aid is a lengthy process requiring significant rest. After 7 consecutive days of uninterrupted rest, the afflicted character can attempt a Will save against the madness's current DC. If she succeeds, the DC is reduced by a number of points equal to 1/2 the character's Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Instead of relying on her own strength of personality to reduce the effects of madness, a character can also seek out a single confidante, priest, or other advisor. The recovering character must meet with that person regularly (at least 8 hours each day) and gain guidance during the 7 days of rest. At the end of the rest period, the ally can attempt a Wisdom or Intelligence check (whichever is higher) with a DC of 15 for a lesser madness or a DC of 20 for a greater madness. On a success, the recovering character can reduce the madness's DC by 1/2 the ally's Wisdom or Intelligence modifier (whichever is higher, minimum 1) in addition to the decrease for resting. The character suffers the madness's effect until the DC is reduced to 0.</p>\n<p>Certain spells can also aid in recovery from madnesses or cure them outright. <em>Lesser restoration </em>has no effect on greater madnesses, but reduces the current DC of one lesser madness afflicting the target by 2, up to once per day. <em>Restoration </em>and <em>heal </em>reduce the current DC of one lesser madness afflicting the target by 5 or of one greater madness afflicting the target by 2, up to once per day each. <em>Greater restoration</em>, <em>limited wish</em>, and <em>psychic surgery(OA) </em>all either cure the target of all lesser madnesses or reduce the DC of one greater madness by the spell's caster level (caster's choice), while <em>miracle </em>or <em>wish </em>immediately cure a target of all lesser and greater madnesses.</p>\n<h1>LESSER MADNESSES</h1>\n<p>Lesser madnesses tend to have less debilitating effects.</p>\n<h1>DELIRIUM</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>lesser madness; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 16</p>\n<p><strong>Onset </strong>1d4 days</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>-2 penalty on Wisdom- and Intelligence-based checks; cannot take 10 or 20 on any check</p>\n<p><strong>Dormancy Effect </strong>None</p>\n<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>\n<p>A character suffering from delirium experiences decreased cognition and attention. Often she has no real sense of this decline, or feels extremely frustrated when she does realize her concentration is impaired. Physical diseases, poisons, and ailments can also cause delirium.</p>\n<h1>DELUSION</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>lesser madness; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 16</p>\n<p><strong>Onset </strong>2d6 days</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The afflicted character believes something that is not true, and no amount of evidence can dissuade him of the belief.</p>\n<p><strong>Dormancy Effect </strong>none</p>\n<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>\n<p>A delusion is the persistence of a belief that no amount of evidence to the contrary can dissuade the afflicted character from having. The belief is often that another specific person either loves or wants to harm the afflicted character, or the afflicted character may have an inflated view of his own abilities or importance. Sometimes the deluded character believes he suffers from an affliction or persecution that does not exist.</p>\n<p>The exact nature of the delusion is decided by the GM. Delusions are typically roleplayed, though a GM might apply penalties to skill and ability checks having to do with the delusion, or decide that such checks fail outright because of the character's delusion. In some circumstances, delusions can be debilitating, while in others they are merely quirky or annoying to those around the character.</p>\n<h1>FUGUE</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>lesser madness; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 18</p>\n<p><strong>Onset </strong>1d4 days</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>-2 penalty on Will saving throws and skill checks, and some memory loss (see below)</p>\n<p><strong>Dormancy Effect </strong>-2 penalty on Will saving throws</p>\n<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>\n<p>A character suffering from a fugue cannot remember things; her name and her past are all equal mysteries. While the character can build new memories, she has trouble accessing those gained before she was inflicted with this madness. While a character in a fugue state can still speak and read any languages she knows and does not lose any of her skills, feats, or skill ranks, she does not remember how she learned such things, and is often surprised when using complex abilities.</p>\n<h1>HALLUCINATION</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>lesser madness; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 14</p>\n<p><strong>Onset </strong>2d6 days</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>-4 penalty on any Will saving throw against or to disbelieve illusions, and illusions of things that are not there (see below)</p>\n<p><strong>Dormancy Effect </strong>The afflicted character takes a -2 penalty on Will saving throws against or to disbelieve illusions.</p>\n<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>\n<p>Hallucinations can affect all of the senses, but some of the most potentially debilitating are auditory hallucinations, where the afflicted character hears voices talking in his head, and visual hallucinations, where the afflicted character sees things that aren't there. Most hallucinations are intermittent and produce a muddling of reality.</p>\n<h1>MANIA</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>lesser madness (compulsion); <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 14</p>\n<p><strong>Onset </strong>1 day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>Each round when an afflicted character is within 30 feet and can see the object of her mania, she must succeed at a Will saving throw or rush to interact with that object. If the afflicted character succeeds at the saving throw by 5 or more, she can keep away from the object of the mania or resist the manic activity for 1 minute before having to attempt the saving throw again. After failing a saving throw and fully performing the mania's compulsion, the afflicted character need not attempt another saving throw for 1 minute, as she has temporarily satisfied her obsession.</p>\n<p><strong>Dormancy Effect </strong>Each round when an afflicted character is within 30 feet and can see the object of her mania, she must attempt a Will saving throw. If she fails, she can choose to either interact with the object of her mania (as above) or become fascinated by the object while abstaining from the activity for 1 round. If the afflicted character succeeds at this saving throw by 5 or more, she can't be fascinated by that particular stimulus for 24 hours before having to attempt the saving throw again (for instance, if a character obsessed with swords succeeded at her save against a particular sword by 5 or more, she wouldn't be fascinated by that sword for 24 hours, but she might be fascinated by other swords).</p>\n<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>\n<p>A mania is an irrational and unhealthy obsession with an object or activity. Nearly any object or activity can become the object of a mania, but often the object is either dangerous (like fire or deadly magic) or somewhat taboo (like the need to commit small thefts or engage in risky sexual behavior). The GM determines the exact nature of the mania, but it should have some connection to the madness's impetus and be respectful to the narrative sensibilities and maturity of the player and the group.</p>\n<h1>MELANCHOLIA</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>lesser madness; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 14</p>\n<p><strong>Onset </strong>1d4 days</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>-2 penalty on initiative checks, and morale bonuses are halved (minimum +0)</p>\n<p><strong>Dormancy Effect </strong>None</p>\n<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>\n<p>A character suffering from melancholia struggles with severe pessimism and can often be slow to respond to threats and events going on around him. He can seem quiet and withdrawn, and his sense of enthusiasm is dulled. In extreme cases, a character suffering from melancholia becomes entirely introverted and utterly withdrawn, even to the point of near catatonia.</p>\n<h1>NIGHT TERRORS</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>lesser madness; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 16</p>\n<p><strong>Onset </strong>1 day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>Each night when the afflicted character sleeps, she must succeed at a saving throw or wake up fatigued (see below).</p>\n<p><strong>Dormancy Effect </strong>None</p>\n<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>\n<p>A character suffering from night terrors is plagued by persistent terrifying dreams, worry, or terror that impedes her from getting restful sleep. Each night the afflicted character must succeed at a saving throw or wake up fatigued, though multiple nights of night terrors do not increase the condition to exhausted, and an exhausted character with night terrors wakes up after 8 hours of sleep either rested or fatigued based on the success or failure of the saving throw for this affliction. Often a character suffering from night terrors will bolt upright during sleep, eyes open, and scream, though less-dramatic symptoms are also possible. A character who awakens fatigued from night terrors doesn't count as having had a good night's rest for the purpose of preparing new spells, and she can't remove the fatigue until she gets a good night's rest by succeeding at the Will save against night terrors.</p>\n<h1>PARANOIA</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>lesser madness; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 17</p>\n<p><strong>Onset </strong>2d6 days</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The afflicted character gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against charm effects, but takes a -2 penalty on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive checks. When the afflicted character attempts a Sense Motive check, the GM rolls the check in secret, and failure gives the afflicted character the impression that those whose motives he is trying to sense are plotting against him in some way. Lastly, any time the afflicted character tries to use or gain a benefit from the aid another action, or is the target of a beneficial spell or effect from an ally, he must succeed at a Will saving throw in order to take the aid another action or gain the benefit from the action, spell, or effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Dormancy Effect </strong>The afflicted character gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against charm effects, but takes a -2 penalty on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive checks.</p>\n<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>\n<p>A paranoid character is convinced that the world and society are conspiring toward his ruin. Typically those afflicted with paranoia are fidgety, argumentative, sullen, or extremely introverted.</p>\n<h1>PHOBIA</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>lesser madness (fear); <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 14</p>\n<p><strong>Onset </strong>1 day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>Each round an afflicted character is within 30 feet and can see the object of her phobia, she must succeed at a Will saving throw or become shaken. The next round, the afflicted character can choose to attempt another saving throw to end the effect, but if she fails, she becomes scared (see page 10) instead. A scared character can choose to attempt another saving throw to become shaken again, but if she fails, she becomes frightened for 1d6 rounds instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Dormancy Effect </strong>Each round an afflicted character is within 30 feet and can see the object of her phobia, she must succeed at a Will saving throw or become shaken for 1 round. If the afflicted character succeeds at this saving throw by 5 or more, that particular stimulus can't cause her to become shaken for 24 hours before having to attempt the saving throw again (for instance, if a character has a phobia of spiders and succeeds at her saving throw by 5 or more after seeing the wizard's spider familiar, she doesn't need to attempt another saving throw against the familiar for 24 hours, but she would still need to attempt a saving throw if she saw a different spider).</p>\n<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>\n<p>A phobia is an irrational fear of an object or activity. Nearly any object or activity can become the focus of a phobia, but often the object is either very specific (like all spiders, no matter how big or small, or clowns) or something that could be hazardous in some situations (like heights or water) but could be made relativity safe with magical or mundane precautions. The GM determines the exact nature of the phobia, but it should have some connection to the madness's impetus and be respectful to the narrative sensibilities and maturity of the player and the group.</p>\n<h1>Horrific Madnesses</h1>\n<p>In both the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook </em>and <em>GameMastery Guide</em>, <em>lesser restoration </em>has no effect on insanity, but under these rules it can be used to treat lesser madnesses. Conversely, <em>greater restoration</em>, <em>heal</em>, and <em>psychic surgery</em>(OA) have reduced effects against greater madnesses in this system compared to in the previous books. This allows madnesses to play a larger part at both higher and lower levels in horror games, or any other game featuring psychological threats. If you want to feature the madnesses as afflictions that are simple to remove for high-level spellcasters while outside the reach of anyone else-as per the more baseline Pathfinder RPG experience-assume lesser madnesses are not affected by <em>lesser restoration</em>, and <em>greater restoration</em>, <em>heal</em>, and <em>psychic surgery </em>remove all madnesses, whether lesser or greater.</p>\n<h1>GREATER MADNESS</h1>\n<p>Greater madnesses can be extremely debilitating.</p>\n<h1>AMNESIA</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>greater madness; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 22</p>\n<p><strong>Onset </strong>immediate</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>-4 penalty on Will saving throws and skill checks, and loss of memory (see below)</p>\n<p><strong>Dormancy Effect </strong>Unlike other madnesses, the normal effect and the dormancy effect of amnesia are the same.</p>\n<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>\n<p>A character suffering from amnesia cannot remember things; his name, skills, and past are all equal mysteries. While the character can build new memories, he has trouble accessing those gained before he contracted amnesia. While a character with amnesia can still speak and read any languages he knows, and doesn't lose the most basic of skills needed to care for himself and interact within society, he cannot remember anything substantial about his past.</p>\n<p>A character with this affliction loses all class abilities, feats, and skill ranks gained before contracting amnesia. He retains his base attack bonus, saving throws bonuses (though he takes a -4 penalty on Will saves), CMB, CMD, total XP, Hit Dice, and hit points. If a character gains a character level while suffering from amnesia, he can use any abilities gained via that class level normally. If the class level he gained was of a class in which he already had levels, he initially gains the abilities of a 1st-level character of that class, even though he is technically of a higher level in that class, and then progresses from there. When the amnesia is cured, the character regains the full abilities of the class; recalculate his level based on his total XP.</p>\n<h1>CATATONIA</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>greater madness; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 24</p>\n<p><strong>Onset </strong>immediate</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The afflicted character acts as if she were cowering, but this is not a fear effect, unlike other forms of cowering.</p>\n<p><strong>Dormancy Effect </strong>The afflicted character is staggered.</p>\n<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>\n<p>A character suffering from catatonia mentally shuts down</p>\n<p>completely, or nearly so, greatly limiting her physical capabilities as well. While a catatonic character still breathes, she can eat or drink without assistance only if the catatonia is dormant. If a catatonic character is faced with a dangerous situation, she must attempt a saving throw. If she succeeds, she acts as if panicked (though this is not a fear effect) until she is out of line of sight of the danger or is cornered. If she is cornered, she cowers again.</p>\n<h1>COGNITIVE BLOCK</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>greater madness; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 20</p>\n<p><strong>Onset </strong>immediate</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The afflicted character can no longer speak or write and has difficulty concentrating. He can no longer use command word items, spell-trigger items, or spell-completion items. He takes a -10 penalty on concentration checks. He cannot cast spells with a verbal or thought (<em>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures </em>144) component, and cannot prepare spells from a spellbook.</p>\n<p><strong>Dormancy Effect </strong>The afflicted character takes a -4 penalty on concentration checks.</p>\n<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>\n<p>This affliction deprives a character of his concentration and his ability to speak, read, and write, though he can understand words he hears and can react to requests and commands as normal.</p>\n<h1>DISSOCIATED IDENTITY</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>greater madness; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 20</p>\n<p><strong>Onset </strong>2d6 days</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>-6 penalty on Will saving throws and Wisdom-based checks, and disassociated identities (see below)</p>\n<p><strong>Dormancy Effect </strong>-2 penalty on Will saving throws and Wisdom-based checks</p>\n<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>\n<p>This is a complicated affliction that manifests as two or more distinct and different personalities in the same mind. The number of personalities is up to the GM, as is the nature of the personalities. Should the affliction worsen in some way (such as by gaining dissociated identity again), the number of additional personalities might increase as well.</p>\n<p>Each morning upon waking and each time the afflicted character is revived from unconsciousness, she must succeed at a Will save, or one of the character's other personalities takes hold. If the afflicted character has more than one personality because of this madness, the manifested personality is either randomly chosen or chosen by the GM. If the afflicted character succeeds at all her saving throws against manifesting alternate personalities for 3 consecutive days, there is a 10% cumulative chance each night thereafter that another personality takes control during the character's sleep, returning to bed afterwards and leaving the character with less sleep than expected; if the afflicted character fails a saving throw, the cumulative chance resets. The afflicted character's memories, skills, and other abilities are unaffected by the personality shift, but typically the various personalities have no knowledge of each other and will deny, often violently, that the other personalities exist.</p>\n<h1>MORAL INSANITY</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>greater madness; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 22</p>\n<p><strong>Onset </strong>3d6 days</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The afflicted character's alignment shifts to evil, and he gains a +10 competence bonus on Bluff checks to hide this madness. Once per day, the afflicted character can attempt a Will saving throw to suppress this effect for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Dormancy Effect </strong>none</p>\n<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>\n<p>This complex madness fills the afflicted character with hatred for the world and a detached feeling about others, as if they were nothing more than pawns for the afflicted character's own uses. A character afflicted by moral insanity might plot the demise of friends and enemies alike, but always with the goal of avoiding blame or consequences and enabling him to continue to feed his dark desires. The impact of moral insanity must be roleplayed, although not all players may find it fun or interesting to play such a character. In such cases, the GM should assume control of the character whenever the madness is dominant. Evil characters can't gain this madness.</p>\n<h1>PSYCHOSOMATIC LOSS</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>greater madness; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 20</p>\n<p><strong>Onset </strong>immediate</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The afflicted character becomes blinded or deafened, loses another special sense (like scent or blindsense), loses the use of limbs, or loses a special movement speed (like a fly or swim speed). The GM chooses how the psychosomatic loss manifests.</p>\n<p><strong>Dormancy Effect </strong>none</p>\n<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>\n<p>While there is nothing physically wrong with the afflicted character, some kind of mental trauma has forced her brain to shut down sensory or motor systems. Furthermore, magical effects that typically remove these conditions (such as <em>remove blindness/ deafness</em>) have no effect on this madness; the madness must be cured in order to regain the senses or motor skills.</p>\n<h1>SCHIZOPHRENIA</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>greater madness; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 22</p>\n<p><strong>Onset </strong>1d6 days</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>-4 penalty on Wisdom- and Charisma-based checks; cannot take 10 or take 20 on any check; chance of becoming confused (see below)</p>\n<p><strong>Dormancy Effect </strong>cannot take 10 or take 20 on any check</p>\n<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>\n<p>A character afflicted with schizophrenia can no longer function as he once did, dealing with sudden deficits in social skills and cognition, and an influx of new, strange behaviors. The character becomes erratic, chaotic, and unpredictable as his affliction and symptoms continue, often hitting a peak of symptoms including hallucinations and delusions. Each time a character afflicted with this madness finds himself in a stressful situation (such as combat), he must succeed at a Will saving throw or become confused for 1d6 rounds.</p>\n<p>^Horror Rules Running Horror Adventures</p>"}

Chapter 6: Running Horror Adventures}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Especially if a GM has run frightening adventures using other roleplaying games, she should understand that the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is not designed with horror in mind. The Pathfinder RPG is a game of heroic adventure where the characters gradually become more powerful than they were at the game's outset-by accumulating special abilities, treasure, and so on. In most games designed to tell frightening tales, however, the characters instead begin play on a downward trajectory toward corruption, insanity, or death. Yet using this chapter's techniques doesn't mean transforming the Pathfinder RPG into an entirely different game. Nor does a horror-themed Pathfinder game suggest that the PCs become less heroic or that they are suddenly destined for a grim fate. It might change what plots, monsters, and locations are included and what sorts of characters players make, but the assumption remains that the PCs will undertake adventures, win treasure, gain power, and ultimately accomplish their quests. The GM might mask these assumptions a bit more than usual-there's no sense of threat if success seems like a foregone conclusion. In the end, though, it gives the GM the opportunity to pit the PCs against escalating horrors and levels of terror.</p>\n<h1>HORROR GAMES AND CONSENT</h1>\n<p>If the story's objective is to unsettle the players rather than their characters, the GM needs something before even starting to seriously think about running such an adventure: the players' consent. Players should understand what it might mean to participate in a horror adventure. Knowing that the game is intended to be creepy is not enough-in the same way that some filmgoers might be on board to see a horror movie aimed at teenage audiences but not one exclusively for adults.</p>\n<p>Anyone planning on participating in a horror adventure should read the following section-GMs and players alike. Of all the content in this book, this section is the most serious because it doesn't deal with fictional characters, but with real people and reactions.</p>\n<h1>For Game Masters</h1>\n<p>The Pathfinder RPG styles itself as a fantasy RPG, not as a horror RPG. Horror adventures often feature unsettling content, and while many players enjoy exploring macabre places, that is not universally true. It is part of your responsibility to make sure your players know that the game will feature frightening elements and give them a sense of what themes to expect. If players express discomfort or concern, change or remove the objectionable aspects or, if necessary, invite the player to participate in a different game.</p>\n<p>You might worry that revealing your story's themes might spoil it. Don't. This preliminary description can act more as a film's trailer, providing the players with glimpses necessary to make informed decisions about whether they'll enjoy the experience. Veiling a game's content is not worth making players feel endangered or like they've been tricked into publicly visiting dark personal places. You can't simply assume that you know what your players will be okay with. No matter how long you might have been playing with someone, nobody broadcasts his every phobia, secret fear, or private experience. So, for the comfort of everyone, make sure your players know what they're getting into.</p>\n<p>Additionally, despite the fact that horror games include more ominous themes than other adventures, just calling something a horror game does not provide an excuse to vent your darkest thoughts without further warning. While many frightening games feature gore, menace, and tragedy, the inclusion of such elements doesn't in itself indicate to your players that scenes of torture, sexual violence, child endangerment, or other brutalities are on the table. \"Grittiness\" and \"realism\" are not excuses to surprise players with this content midgame. If a game might feature such elements, you remain responsible for making your players aware of that beforehand and letting them decide whether they want to play.</p>\n<p>Finally, sometimes opinions and expectations simply change. Let players know that if they become uncomfortable with any part of your game, it's perfectly fine for them to leave the game space. Make yourself available to discuss your game's content if a player so desires-but understand you are not owed any insight into your players' reactions. If a player expresses concerns about a game's content, he doesn't need to explain himself; either remove the sensitive element, run a different game, or ask the player to participate in a different game.</p>\n<p>If you keep these considerations in mind and prioritize your players' enjoyment, you'll be on your way to running an adventure your group remembers for its creepiness, not its unintended negative consequences.</p>\n<h1>For Players</h1>\n<p>The Pathfinder RPG is a storytelling game, and as with stories in any medium, sometimes the tale ventures into dark places. If you are a participant in a game that makes you feel uncomfortable or threatened, you can stop playing at any time. You don't have to endure a game that unsettles you in a way you don't enjoy. If that occurs, it's entirely acceptable to leave the game and remove yourself to a safe space.</p>\n<p>If you want to tell the group that you need a break or have a private discussion with the GM, you may, but don't feel obligated to. Sometimes GMs seek to include disturbing content in their games to be shocking, to be gritty, or to mimic content from television or film. Unfortunately, such elements often overlap with real-world truths and traumas that are anything but entertaining. Just as you might avoid that content in other media, you have every right to avoid it in gaming.</p>\n<p>A good way to avoid a game that focuses on content that you're not comfortable with is to talk with your GM before the game starts and find out what sort of adventure she intends to run. Ask whether the GM expects any extreme or R-rated content. As discussed above, it is part of every GM's responsibility to assure that her players have a good time, but (unfortunately) you can't trust every GM to act on this. If a GM proves reticent to reveal a game's themes or implies that there will be disturbing or adult content without elaborating on what, strongly consider not attending that game.</p>\n<p>Just as you would want the GM and other players to respect your boundaries, make sure to respect theirs. Unless the other players and the GM have already agreed to a truly dark game, don't contribute to making a game uncomfortable by playing a depraved character or by going into explicit detail about your character's horrid deeds. And if other players feel they need to leave the game, either help change the game to something everyone enjoys or support their decision to leave.</p>\n<p>Everyone should be working together to create a game that's fun for the entire group, so know that it's literally in the Pathfinder game's rules (on page 9 of the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em>) that playing the Pathfinder RPG is supposed to be rewarding for everyone involved.</p>"}

Chapter 2: Archetypes and Class Options","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<p>@Compendium[pf-content.horror-adventures.jsEW1pMN3Ds5FXmw]{(Index) Horror Adventures}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.horror-adventures.qet8A89j9mn1czfm]{2.0. Chapter 2: Archetypes And Class Options}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Barbarians give themselves over to an extraordinary anger, which can provide the tools needed to perform deeds of heroism but also has the potential to create rage-fueled nightmares driven to uncontrolled slaughter. Whether she's a remorseless killing machine, a merciless thrall, or an unusual type of infected lycanthrope, the sheer violence within a barbarian's heart makes her an intriguing tragic villain or troubled hero.</p>\n<h1>RAGE POWERS</h1>\n<p>Any barbarian (or other character that gains rage powers) who meets the prerequisites can take the following new rage powers. A character can select from only one group of totem rage powers.</p>\n<p><strong>Cult Totem (Ex)</strong>: The barbarian can make an attack of opportunity against a creature within her reach who damages an ally of the barbarian with a melee attack. Only the enemy, not the barbarian's ally, needs to be within the barbarian's melee reach in order for the barbarian to make this attack of opportunity. Once the barbarian makes an attack of opportunity against a creature with this ability, she can't use this ability to make an attack of opportunity against the same creature for 24 hours. A barbarian must be at least 6th level and have the lesser cult totem rage power to select this rage power.</p>\n<p><strong>Cult Totem, Greater (Su)</strong>: While the barbarian is raging, when she takes hit point damage that would render her dying or dead, she remains conscious and raging until the end of her next turn after taking that damage, though she is disabled during that turn. She becomes dying or dead at the end of her next turn as normal for her current hit point total. This ability has no effect if the barbarian dies from a cause other than hit point damage, such as from a death effect or if her Constitution damage exceeds her Constitution score. A barbarian must be at least 10th level and have the lesser cult totem and cult totem rage powers to select this rage power.</p>\n<p><strong>Cult Totem, Lesser (Ex)</strong>: While the barbarian is raging, any morale bonuses or bonuses for flanking she gains on attacks rolls are added to her damage rolls instead of her attack rolls. They are still morale bonuses, and they don't stack with other morale bonuses on damage rolls.</p>\n<p><strong>Daemon Totem (Su)</strong>: While the barbarian is raging, her melee attacks impose a temporary negative level on her opponent on a successful critical hit. After 1 hour, these temporary negative levels disappear automatically (without a saving throw). A barbarian must be at least 6th level and have the lesser daemon totem rage power to select this rage power.</p>\n<p><strong>Daemon Totem, Greater (Su)</strong>: If the barbarian kills an intelligent creature with a CR equal to at least half her character level while raging, she heals 5 hit points. If she is already at her maximum number of hit points, she instead gains 5 temporary hit points, which don't stack if she kills multiple creatures. A barbarian must be at least 10th level and have the lesser daemon totem and daemon totem rage powers to select this rage power.</p>\n<p><strong>Daemon Totem, Lesser (Su)</strong>: While raging, the barbarian gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against acid damage, death effects, disease, and poison. This bonus increases by 1 for each daemon totem rage power the barbarian has, excluding this one.</p>\n<p><strong>Fight Response (Ex)</strong>: When a barbarian with this rage power attempts a saving throw against a fear effect, she can enter a rage as an immediate action (as long as she would normally be able to enter rage). This consumes 3 rounds of the barbarian's daily allotment of rage rounds, but the barbarian can maintain the rage each round on her turn normally. Any benefits from the barbarian's rage apply immediately, so she gains her bonus on Will saves against the effect that required the initial saving throw. Unlike most rage powers, this rage power's effects are useful only when the barbarian is not raging, so a skald can't grant this rage power to allies with raging song.</p>\n<h1>Dreadnought (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Unstoppable and fearless, the dreadnought turns the terror of her enemies into violent physical power.</p>\n<p><strong>Dead Calm (Ex)</strong>: A dreadnought can enter a dispassionate killing spree as a free action, granting her additional combat prowess. The dreadnought gains only half the usual bonuses from her rage but takes no penalty to her AC, can use all her normal skills and effects that require concentration, and is not fatigued when her rage ends. The dreadnought cannot enter a rage for 1 minute after she ends her rage, and she cannot charge or run while under the effects of her rage.</p>\n<p>This ability alters rage.</p>\n<p><strong>Steady Gait (Ex)</strong>: A dreadnought advances steadily, shrugging off attempts to slow her advance. The dreadnought gains a +1 bonus on saving throws and to her CMD against effects that would slow or immobilize her. This bonus increases to +2 when she gains greater rage and +3 when she gains mighty rage.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces fast movement.</p>\n<p><strong>Fearless Killer (Su)</strong>: Starting at 14th level, a dreadnought becomes implacable in her pursuit of slaughter. While in rage, she is immune to fear effects.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces indomitable will.</p>\n<p><strong>Instant Dispassion (Ex)</strong>: At 17th level, a dreadnought can quickly turn her compassion on and off. She can enter a rage as soon as she wants after ending a previous rage.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces tireless rage.</p>\n<h1>Fearsome Defender (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Dark overlords frequently recruit their most bloodthirsty followers to serve as brutal bodyguards. These savage slaves feel little pain and exist only to rain terror down on the enemies of their pitiless masters.</p>\n<p><strong>Intractable (Ex)</strong>: A combination of brainwashing and loyalty helps a fearsome defender resist pain and torture, enduring grueling combat or questioning without betraying her dark lord. A fearsome defender gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against pain(UM) effects, and the DCs of checks to coerce her or demoralize her with Diplomacy or Intimidate increase by 2. Both the bonus and the increase to DCs increase by 2 when she gains greater rage and again by 2 when she gains mighty rage.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces fast movement.</p>\n<p><strong>Off the Leash (Ex)</strong>: Beginning at 2nd level, a fearsome defender simmers on the edge of bloody combat. Whenever she begins a rage, she can also draw an unconcealed weapon as part of the free action to begin raging.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces uncanny dodge.</p>\n<p><strong>Silent Threat (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a fearsome defender exudes hostility, creating a threatening atmosphere in her presence. The fearsome defender gains a +1 bonus on Intimidate checks, and the DCs of Intimidate checks to demoralize her allies within 30 feet increase by 1. Both the bonus and the increase to DCs increase by 1 at 6th level and every 3 barbarian levels thereafter.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces trap sense.</p>\n<p><strong>Bloodlust (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a fearsome defender's eagerness for bloodshed makes her quicker to act in a fight. She adds her Charisma modifier to initiative checks and always acts during the surprise round. If the fearsome defender is surprised during the surprise round, she acts last in that round and then determines initiative order normally for the remainder of combat.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>\n<h1>Mooncursed (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Some barbarians exhibit an unusual form of lycanthropy powered by their fury. Such a character transforms willfully but can maintain her animal or hybrid forms only while raging.</p>\n<p><strong>Race</strong>: A mooncursed must either be a humanoid or monstrous humanoid.</p>\n<p><strong>Shifting Rage (Su)</strong>: A mooncursed can call upon an animal totem or inner curse, transforming her into a savage beast. Starting at 1st level, she chooses bear, boar, crocodile, shark, tiger, or wolf. Once chosen, this animal can't be changed. When using rounds of her shifting rage, instead of the usual bonuses and penalties from rage, the mooncursed transforms into a Medium version of this animal's form as if under the influence of <em>beast shape I</em>, treating her class level as her caster level whenever relevant. Other aspects of rage aside from the bonuses and penalties, such as the skill restrictions on skills and effects that require concentration, still apply during a shifting rage.</p>\n<p>This ability alters rage.</p>\n<p><strong>Hybrid Rage (Su)</strong>: Beginning at 5th level, a mooncursed can choose to assume a hybrid of her base type and alternate form instead of her usual alternate form during her shifting rage. If she does, the animal's forelimbs (or pectoral fins for the shark) remain hands able to manipulate objects and wield weapons as well as human hands do, she can walk on two legs (the shark's tail fins remain legs), and she can talk.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>\n<p><strong>Greater Shifting Rage (Su)</strong>: At 11th level, a mooncursed can assume larger alternate and hybrid forms. This functions like <em>beast shape II</em>, and it allows the mooncursed to take on a Medium or Large version of her animal's form.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces greater rage.</p>\n<p><strong>Mighty Shifting Rage (Su)</strong>: At 20th level, a mooncursed can assume even larger alternate and hybrid forms. This functions like <em>beast shape III</em>, and it allows the mooncursed to take on a Medium, Large, or Huge version of her animal's form.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces mighty rage.</p>\n<p>^Archetypes and Class Options Feats</p>"}

Chapter 4: Spells And Rituals}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Magic has the capability of twisting reality into any number of horrific forms. Vile spellcasters create vicious and disgusting spells so they can spread their cruelty. Warping bodies, contacting mad creatures from the beyond, and paving a path to power by sacrificing living creatures all become possible to those who divest themselves from compassion. Many horror spells revolve around the theme of corruption, from those that deal with the monstrous corruptions detailed in Chapter 1 to the corruption of the caster's sanity by spells that touch on unknowable things. In fact, many spells include optional effects that tie into the sanity system (see page 12), though they still function in a campaign that doesn't use it.</p>\n<p>But the forces of good possess their own magic to struggle back against the darkness. They arm themselves with holy weapons and employ restorative magic to undo the harm to the soul and sanity of those subjected to horrors they had never imagined.</p>\n<h1>HORROR SPELLS IN OTHER SOURCES</h1>\n<p>Many spells from previous books can be used to great effect in horror games.

Chapter 1: Horror Characters}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The pit of Hell waits for your damned soul.</p>\n<h1>CATALYST</h1>\n<p>The hellbound corruption typically takes hold as the result of an infernal contract with a diabolic patron or your fiendish blood. Your soul goes to Hell when you die, though you can be raised from the dead normally.</p>\n<h1>Progression</h1>\n<p>Your diabolic patron's portfolio determines what makes your corruption progress. When an opportunity to carry out a significant action that matches the devil's portfolio comes up, you are tempted to take it. The action might include oppressing people using your authority or tempting someone closer to lawful evil. You must succeed at a Will save (DC = 15 + your manifestation level) or succumb to temptation and perform the action. What counts as significant is up to the GM. Usually, an act that wouldn't harm anyone doesn't count. If something prevents you from performing this act, the GM chooses a time over the next week when you're compelled to further the cause of lawful evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 1</strong>: The first time you perform a significant act that matches the devil's portfolio (either willingly or because you failed your save),</p>\n<p>your alignment shifts one step toward lawful evil (toward evil first, if you aren't yet evil). Any attempt to raise you from the dead requires a successful caster level check (DC = 15 + double your manifestation level).</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 2</strong>: The second time you perform such an act, your alignment shifts to lawful evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 3</strong>: The third time you perform such an act, your contract comes due or you become a thrall to Hell-a living devil under the GM's control.</p>\n<h1>Removing the Corruption</h1>\n<p>Gaining release requires destroying your patron, retrieving the payment, and atoning.</p>\n<h1>MANIFESTATIONS</h1>\n<p>The following are manifestations of the hellbound corruption.</p>\n<h1>Darkest Desires</h1>\n<p>Your dark patron offers to grant you wishes to tempt you.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Manifestation level 9th.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You can use <em>limited wish </em>once per day as a spell-like ability. It can't duplicate a spell requiring a material component costing more than 1,000 gp. Each time you get more or less what you wished for (GM's discretion), you must succeed at a Will save or your corruption progresses to the next stage.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Wishes you make from this manifestation's gift or your own spells are granted by your patron and interpreted from a devil's perspective. The patron always tries to twist your wish away from your intent and to its own dark ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: Upon receiving this manifestation, you must take both the gift and the stain, even with the useful corruption or vile corruption variants.</p>\n<h1>Devil's Horns</h1>\n<p>Horns grow upon your brow.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain a gore attack that deals 1d4 points of damage if your size is Medium (1d3 if Small). These horns appear in any form you take, so you still retain this gore attack in any form you assume with a polymorph effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You gain horns that can't be hidden by magic, but can be hidden by mundane means. Anyone who sees the horns recognizes them as unnatural. If someone leaves a loophole in an agreement with you that would allow you to gain an advantage, you must exploit it. This typically counts as an act that might progress your corruption.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: Upon receiving this manifestation, you must take both the gift and the stain, even with the useful corruption or vile corruption variants.</p>\n<h1>Devil's Mark</h1>\n<p>You have the mark of a fiend on your body.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain a 1st-level sorcerer/wizard or witch spell of your choice as a spell-like ability usable a number of times per day equal to your manifestation level. It must not have a casting time longer than 1 standard action or a material or focus component costing more than 1 gp.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Your devil's mark manifests on your body. It can't be hidden by magic, but can be hidden by clothing or other mundane means. Anyone who sees the mark automatically recognizes it as unnatural.</p>\n<h1>Diabolical Servitor</h1>\n<p>You fraternize with devils who answer your call for aid.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Manifestation level 2nd.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Once per day as a spell-like ability, you can summon a lawful evil outsider, as <em>summon monster II </em>with a duration of 1 minute per manifestation level. At manifestation level 4th, you can use <em>summon monster III</em>, but summon an accuser devil (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 </em>84). At manifestation level 6th, you can use <em>summon monster IV </em>this way. At manifestation level 8th, you can use <em>summon monster V </em>this way.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You see lies and pain behind every exchange, even when it isn't there. You take a -4 penalty on Perception and Sense Motive checks except for those made against devils.</p>\n<h1>Fiendish Tutelage</h1>\n<p>You learn secrets best kept from mortal minds.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain Infernal as a bonus language and a +2 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks to interact with devils. When you acquire this gift, choose two Knowledge skills. You can attempt checks with them untrained. At manifestation level 3rd, the bonuses double.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Effects that vary based on your alignment treat you as lawful evil or your true alignment, whichever is worse.</p>\n<h1>Murky Futures</h1>\n<p>You can call upon Hell for clues about how to avoid your fate.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Once per day, you can call upon the knowledge of Hell with 10 minutes of meditation. You gain the benefit of <em>guidance</em>, with a duration of 24 hours or until discharged. At higher manifestation levels, you can choose to gain the benefit of a different divination spell at the end of your meditation instead: <em>augury </em>at manifestation level 2nd, <em>divination </em>at manifestation level 4th, or <em>contact other plane </em>at manifestation level 6th (to consult Asmodeus or an intermediate deity).</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Increase the DCs of Constitution checks you attempt to stabilize while dying, Heal checks targeting you, and caster level checks required for conjuration (healing) spells to benefit you by 2 (the DC increase applies on the caster level check required to raise you from the dead at corruption stage 1). At manifestation level 3rd, the DCs increase by 4 instead. Your soul flees immediately on death, so you can't be revived by <em>breath of life</em>, the gift of life domain power, or any similar ability.</p>\n<h1>Passage through the Pit</h1>\n<p>The maw of Hell yawns wide to welcome you.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Manifestation level 3rd.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You can step through Hell to reach other places once per hour. As a full-round action, you can choose a direction, then teleport 2d10 x 5 feet away in that direction (or the nearest safe, unoccupied location). You can use this ability once per minute at manifestation level 6th, and at will at manifestation level 8th.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You register as lawful evil as well as your own alignment to effects that reveal alignments. This alignment aura is strong, as if you were a lawful evil cleric. You are treated as an extraplanar lawful evil outsider with the devil subtype by abjurations that protect against such creatures.</p>\n<h1>Serpent's Tongue</h1>\n<p>You gain the persuasive power of a master deceiver.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 3rd, fiendish tutelage*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain a +2 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks. Once per day when you succeed at a Bluff or Diplomacy check against a creature, you can attempt to influence it as if using <em>suggestion </em>with a caster level equal to your character level and a duration of 1 minute per level. At manifestation level 6th, the bonuses increase to +4.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Your tongue takes on a serpentlike fork that can't be hidden by magic, though you can attempt a Disguise check to conceal it. Attempt one Disguise check per interaction, opposed by your opponent's Perception. Your devil tongue rebels when you work against infernal interests. When you attempt to cast a spell for a chaotic or good cause (as determined by the GM), you have a 20% spell failure chance if it has a verbal components and a -5 penalty on concentration checks if it has a thought component (<em>Occult Adventures </em>144) .</p>\n<h1>Tenuous Soul</h1>\n<p>Your soul feels the constant and increasing pull of Hell.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against emotion (<em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic </em>137) and fear spells and effects. You are immune to spells and effects that would trap or destroy your soul except those employed by a devil. At manifestation level 3rd, the bonuses increase to +4.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You take a -2 penalty on saving throws against spells and effects that would possess you or control your actions. At manifestation level 3rd, the penalty changes to -4.</p>"}

Chapter 1: Horror Characters","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<p>@Compendium[pf-content.horror-adventures.jsEW1pMN3Ds5FXmw]{(Index) Horror Adventures}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.horror-adventures.LvcaVxE3FjZKdLfz]{1.0. Chapter 1: Horror Characters}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Even the most pure creature can succumb to tides of darkness. What begins as a minor malady or errant idea can grow into something malignant-a spreading corruption that can obscure your morals, cloud your judgment, and ultimately devour your soul. There are a number of different types of corruptions, from the hunger of vampirism to the horrifying transformation of the promethean. Living with a corruption is often a terrifying experience, but also offers the temptation of dark gifts. Hosts sometimes choose not to fight the corruption, but rather accept it and allow it to progress. These unfortunate folk either succumb to lust for the corruption's power or attempt to control the stain of corruption and use its gifts for some greater good.</p>\n<p>Each corruption detailed on the pages that follow features a general description, followed by its catalysts and manifestations. The catalyst section explains how a creature might contract the corruption, how it progresses, and how it can be cured. When a creature first contracts a corruption and its manifestation level increases, the corrupted creature gains manifestations. Manifestations carry both beneficial gifts and detrimental stains. Also, as the manifestation level increases, the stains and gifts of previous manifestations might grow more powerful. Lastly, as a creature's manifestation level increases, so does the possibility of the corruption taking hold entirely, defiling its host forever.</p>\n<h1>Glossary</h1>\n<p>A short list of terms related to corruptions follows.</p>\n<p><strong>Catalyst</strong>: The inciting incident that corrupted you in the game's story, combined with ways you can progress toward total corruption.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption</strong>: A dark manifestation of evil or alien influence that changes you over time.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage</strong>: A measure of how close you are to falling to your corruption. Think of your corruption stage as how much your soul has been altered by your corruption. At corruption stage 3, you succumb and are no longer a PC.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: A benefit granted by a manifestation of your corruption.</p>\n<p><strong>Manifestation</strong>: A manifestation is a way in which your corruption becomes more prominent. You gain manifestations roughly every 2 character levels you live with your corruption. Each manifestation has both a gift and a stain, although you might not get both.</p>\n<p><strong>Manifestation Level</strong>: This is a measure of how much your corruption has changed your body and mind. Your manifestation level equals the number of manifestations you have.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: A negative effect granted by a manifestation of your corruption.</p>\n<h1>Contracting a Corruption</h1>\n<p>The catalyst section of each corruption offers a number of possible methods for contracting that corruption. Once you contract a corruption, you immediately gain a manifestation. Your manifestation level becomes 1, and your number of manifestations and your manifestation level can increase as described in Manifestation Level on page 15. You also draw closer to losing your soul, as represented by your corruption stage. This is described under The Corruption's Progress.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple Corruptions</strong>: Typically, you can have only one corruption. If some exceedingly rare condition arises that would cause you to be affected by more than one, you typically gain stains from both corruptions' manifestations but gifts from only the first one you contracted, and the secondary corruption also grants manifestations at a slower rate. When the text refers to your manifestation level, use only your manifestation level for the second corruption, not the sum of all your manifestation levels.</p>\n<h1>Manifestations</h1>\n<p>You gain a manifestation of your curse when you first contract a corruption, and gain more at later levels. Each manifestation includes both a gift and a stain (though campaign variants can change how you acquire these gifts and stains as described in the Variants section below). Many manifestations have prerequisites that limit them to characters farther along in their corruptions. A prerequisite marked with an asterisk (*) is another manifestation in the same section.</p>\n<p>Unless stated otherwise, the DC for gifts that allow a saving throw is equal to 10 + 1/2 your level + your manifestation level (see below). You can have a maximum of nine manifestations.</p>\n<h1>Variants</h1>\n<p>A corruption's gift and stain don't have to manifest together. Your GM can use the following variants to alter how gifts and stains are gained.</p>\n<p><strong>Useful Corruption</strong>: In this form of campaign, your corruption's gifts allow you to fight sinister forces. You select which manifestation to take when you gain the corruption and with each increase to your manifestation level. You receive the gift, but you don't have to take the stain. If you refuse the stain, that manifestation doesn't increase your manifestation level, which could prevent you from qualifying for additional manifestations. You can accept the stain of your manifestations at any time, immediately increasing your manifestation level.</p>\n<p><strong>Vile Corruption</strong>: In this form of campaign, corruptions are terrible burdens to be purged as soon as possible. When you contract a corruption or your manifestation level increases, the GM decides which manifestation you gain. You always acquire the stain, but you can choose not to take the gift. If you refuse the gift, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on saving throws related to the corruption progressing. For each additional gift you refuse, this bonus increases by 1. You can accept the gifts of your manifestations at any time, but once you do, you immediately lose the corresponding bonus on saving throws.</p>\n<h1>Manifestation Levels</h1>\n<p>Each creature with a corruption has a manifestation level, which is normally equal to the number of manifestations the corrupted creature has (see Variants for exceptions). Sometimes gifts and stains become more extreme as a creature's manifestation level increases.</p>\n<p>You gain a new manifestation roughly every 2 levels. GMs can introduce corruptions as early as your 1st character level. A standard rate of corruption starts with a PC gaining the first stain at 1st level, the second at 3rd level, and another at 5th, 7th, 9th, and so on. Because you are limited to nine manifestations, your manifestation level can't exceed 9th.</p>\n<p>This standard rate of acquisition is a guideline rather than a strict rule. Many corruptions feature story considerations that could speed up or slow down the process, and individual GMs can alter the speed to serve the campaign's narrative. When introducing a corruption at higher levels, a GM could accelerate the rate at which the first manifestations are acquired or grant multiple manifestations at once. In any case, the GM decides when a corruption progresses, not you (though variants can alter this, as described in Variants).</p>\n<h1>The Corruption's Progress</h1>\n<p>Every corruption has an associated saving throw. Each time you fail it, your corruption progresses to the next corruption stage. Each stage causes a more significant change within you, until you become completely irredeemable at corruption stage 3. When you gain a corruption, you begin at what is effectively stage 0, with no direct penalties. You must attempt a saving throw when you are being pulled toward darkness, and these saves are usually spread over a long period of time (often weeks or months). As such, abilities that allow or force rerolls (or rolling twice and taking the higher or lower result) can never be used on these saving throws, and temporary bonuses don't apply on the progression saving throw, even if they are long-lasting.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}
{"_id":"I9rP5LnqMT4hqj6m","name":"2.09. Mesmerist","permission":{"default":0,"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR":3},"folder":"","flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_vh83dbmaz5j","path":"Horror Adventures#/CF_SEP/2.

Chapter 2: Archetypes And Class Options}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Mesmerists delight in bending others' minds to their whims.</p>\n<h1>Dreamstalker (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Many mesmerists concentrate their studies on conscious, rational thought, but dreamstalkers instead delve into the unleashed unconscious mind that wanders free in dreams.</p>\n<p><strong>Dreams of Pain</strong>: A dreamstalker's painful stare deals nonlethal damage.</p>\n<p>This ability alters painful stare.</p>\n<p><strong>Somnomancer</strong>: At 1st level, a dreamstalker gains the slumber(APG) hex. The dreamstalker's effective witch level is equal to her mesmerist level, and she can activate them only by expending two daily uses of mesmerist tricks. The save DCs for her hexes are Charisma-based. She can take certain additional hexes in place of mesmerist tricks, selecting nightmares(APG) or vision(APG) at 10th level and higher, or eternal slumber(APG) at 18th level and higher.</p>\n<p>When she would normally gain a new mesmerist trick, she can learn additional spells instead. Each time she does so, she adds two of the following spells of a level she can currently cast to her list of spells known: 1st-<em>oneiric horror</em>(OA),<em> sleep</em>; 2nd-<em>detect mindscape</em>(OA),<em> greater oneiric horror</em>(OA),<em> instigate psychic duel</em>(OA); 3rd-<em>deep slumber</em>, <em>minor dream</em>(OA); 4th-<em>create mindscape</em>(OA),<em> dream, forgetful slumber</em>(ARG), <em>mindscape door</em>(OA),<em> sleepwalk</em>(ARG), <em>sleepwalking suggestion </em>(see page 127); 5th-<em>cloak of dreams, dream council</em>(OA),<em> dream scan</em>(OA),<em> symbol of sleep, waves of fatigue</em>; 6th-<em>dream travel</em>(OA), <em>greater create mindscape</em>(OA),<em> waves of exhaustion. </em></p>\n<p>This alters mesmerist tricks and replaces the 1st-level mesmerist trick.</p>\n<p><strong>Sleepless (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a dreamstalker gains immunity to sleep effects and a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus on saving throws against fatigue and exhaustion. She loses both benefits when under an effect that would prevent her from providing an emotion component (<em>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures </em>144).</p>\n<p>This replaces towering ego.</p>\n<p><strong>Touch of Night (Su)</strong>: A dreamstalker can't remove shaken, frightened, sickened, cowering, nauseated, or panicked conditions using her touch treatment. However, she can remove fatigue or magical sleep (other than hard-to-remove magical sleep such as the eternal slumber(APG) hex) as a minor condition, staggered as a moderate condition, and exhausted as a greater condition. As normal, removing fatigue or exhaustion only removes the condition, not the underlying cause, such as lack of sleep.</p>\n<p>This ability alters touch treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>Dreamwalker (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, a dreamstalker treats dreamscapes as a favored terrain, as per the ranger ability, gaining a +2 bonus that increases by 2 every 4 mesmerist levels after 5th. While in a dreamscape, she also treats any creature from the Dimension of Dreams (including dreamed figments) as her favored enemy, with a bonus equal to 1/2 her favored terrain bonus.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces manifold tricks.</p>\n<p><strong>Traumatic Spell</strong>: At 11th level, a dreamstalker gains Traumatic Spell(OA) as a bonus feat.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces glib lie.</p>\n<h1>Gaslighter (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>A gaslighter takes joy in others' suffering, delighting in driving them to madness.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: A gaslighter must be of an evil alignment. A gaslighter who becomes nonevil cannot gain new levels as a mesmerist but retains all his class abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Consummate Cruelty</strong>: A gaslighter gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) on Intimidate checks. A gaslighter can take Improved Dirty Trick(APG) and Greater Dirty Trick(APG) without having Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of 13. He can also ignore those two prerequisites for other feats that have Improved Dirty Trick or Greater Dirty Trick as a prerequisite.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces consummate liar.</p>\n<p><strong>Horrid Mask (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, as a standard action, a gaslighter can implant a maddening phantasm in the mind of the target of his hypnotic stare, causing the target to perceive its own reflection as corrupted in some disturbing way. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and there is no saving throw. The target is simultaneously captivated and horrified by the sight of its own reflection, and in any round in which the target can see itself in a mirror within 30 feet, the gaslighter can trigger his painful stare against the target without dealing damage. This is a gaze attack, and the creature can avert its eyes to attempt to avoid it. Any creature holding a visible mirror that attempts to demoralize the target can choose to add the gaslighter's Charisma modifier to its Intimidate check instead of its own. Horrid mask lasts until that particular hypnotic stare ends (often when the target moves away from a mirror). The gaslighter can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces touch treatment (minor) and alters painful stare.</p>\n<p><strong>Phantasmal Force (Su)</strong>: At 6th level, a gaslighter can force the target of his horrid mask ability to recoil from its reflection. Whenever the gaslighter uses horrid mask, if an affected target begins its turn adjacent to a mirror, it must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the gaslighter's mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier) or be compelled to either flee from the mirror (or the creature holding it) to beyond 30 feet or attempt to destroy the mirror (or the creature holding it). This is a gaze attack, and the target can attempt to avert its eyes.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces touch treatment (moderate).</p>\n<p><strong>Phantasmal Foes (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a gaslighter can spend one use of his horrid mask ability as a standard action to convince the target of his hypnotic stare that it is surrounded by foes only it can see. The target is treated as flanked for any melee attacks against it until the hypnotic stare ends. The gaslighter can use either this ability or horrid mask during a particular hypnotic stare, but not both at once. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces touch treatment (greater).</p>\n<p><strong>Corrosion of Sanity (Su)</strong>: At 14th level, whenever a creature fails its initial saving throw against a gaslighter's single-target mind-affecting effect, the target also takes 1 point of Wisdom damage. This has no effect on abilities that don't allow a saving throw or affect multiple targets or an area. If using the sanity system (see page 12), the target takes 2 points of sanity damage instead.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces touch treatment (<em>break enchantment</em>).</p>\n<h1>Hate-Monger (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Hate-mongers are xenophobic and judgmental rabble-rousers who whip up mobs against enemies real or imagined.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: A hate-monger must be of a nongood alignment. A hate-monger who becomes good cannot gain new levels as a mesmerist but retains all his class abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Mental Manipulator (Ex)</strong>: A hate-monger masters a broad repertoire of emotional corruption. At 1st level, he adds one spell from the 1st-level spells below to his spells known. When he would gain a new mesmerist trick, he can learn additional spells instead, adding two of the following spells of a level he can currently cast to his spells known: 1st-<em>cause fear, compel hostility</em>(UC), <em>delusional pride</em>(UM), <em>demand offering</em>(OA), <em>forbid action</em>(UM), <em>lesser confusion</em>, <em>murderous command</em>(UM), <em>scare, sow thought</em>(ARG); 2nd-<em>aversion</em>(OA), <em>paranoia</em>(OA), <em>rage</em>, <em>unadulterated loathing</em>(UM); 3rd- <em>confusion, crushing despair, curse of disgust</em>(UM), <em>fear, instant enemy</em>(APG), <em>malicious spite</em>(UM), <em>smug narcissism</em>(UM), <em>spite</em>(APG); 4th-<em>envious urge</em>(UM), <em>feast on fear</em>(ARG), <em>greater forbid action</em>(UM), <em>modify memory</em>, <em>utter contempt</em>(UM); 5th-<em>foe to friend</em>(APG), <em>foster hatred</em>(OA), <em>song of discord, repress memory</em>(OA), <em>unwilling shield</em>(APG), <em>vengeful outrage</em>(UM); 6th- <em>eyebite</em>, <em>insanity</em>, <em>overwhelming presence</em>(UM), <em>symbol of persuasion</em>.</p>\n<p>When he casts a spell he learns in this way, he increases the duration as if his caster level were 1 higher. Starting at 5th level, the save DC is increased by 1 for creatures of his favored enemy type.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces consummate liar and alters mesmerist tricks.</p>\n<p><strong>Insidious Hatred (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a hate-monger can sow hatred and strife under the pretense of assisting others. He can use his touch treatment only on others, but as part of the action of using touch treatment, he can cast any targeted spell from the mental manipulator list that does not have a range of \"personal\" and has a casting time of 1 standard action or less, targeting only the creature that receives his touch treatment. That creature doesn't realize the hate-monger has cast a spell, and considers any manifestations to be part of the touch treatment. Other creatures notice as normal. The target creature takes a -2 penalty on its saving throw and to its spell resistance against the spell.</p>\n<p>This ability alters touch treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>Xenophobe (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a hate-monger can choose one favored enemy, as per the ranger class feature. His favored enemy bonus begins at +2 and increases by 2 for every 4 mesmerist levels after 5th, but he does not gain additional favored enemies. His favored enemy bonus also applies on Intimidate checks against his favored enemy.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces mental potency and manifold tricks.</p>\n<p><strong>Out for Blood (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level, when a creature takes extra damage from the hate-monger's painful stare, it also takes 1 point of bleed damage (or 1 point of bleed damage per 1d6 points of damage dealt by the painful stare if the hate-monger damages the target himself ). This bleed damage does not stack with itself or other sources of bleed damage.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces the 7th-level bold stare.</p>\n<p><strong>Insidious Emotions (Su)</strong>: At 11th level, the power of a hate-monger's psychic hold becomes more difficult to detect or to break. The DC of Sense Motive checks to notice if a creature is under the effects of his enchantments with the emotion(UM) descriptor increases by 5 (if he also has the Subtle Enchantment(UI) feat, the effects stack), as does the DC to identify his emotion spells. Magical divinations can detect his emotion effects only if the caster succeeds at a caster level check (DC = 11 + the hate-monger's mesmerist level) as if the affected creatures were the subject of <em>nondetection. </em></p>\n<p>This ability replaces glib lie.</p>\n<p>^Archetypes and Class Options Feats</p>"}

Chapter 3: Feats}</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Absorb Spirit</h1>\n<p>You absorb restless spirits into your body at the cost of your own life force and sanity.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Con 13, must have died at least once or been possessed by an undead creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When an incorporeal undead with the rejuvenation special ability or a haunt is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points within 30 feet of you, you can attempt to absorb its spirit into your body as an immediate action. You must attempt a Will save with a DC equal to 5 + twice the CR of the undead creature or haunt. If you are a medium with the haunt channeler(OA) class feature, you receive a +2 bonus on this saving throw. If you succeed, you harbor the undead or haunt's essence, and it cannot continue to rejuvenate or manifest until you release it.</p>\n<p>For every 24 hours that you harbor the entity, you must attempt a Constitution check (DC = 10 + the CR of the undead or haunt). If you are a medium with the haunt channeler class feature, you receive a +2 bonus on this check. If you fail the check, you take 1d4 points of Constitution and Wisdom damage. If you succeed, you take 1 point of Constitution and Wisdom damage. No effect can prevent or reduce this ability damage, nor can the ability damage be healed or suppressed by any means until you release the spirit. You can release the spirit at any time as a standard action, at which point the spirit returns to its former location and begins rejuvenating or manifesting again as normal. If you die from the Constitution damage, the spirit is released, and if you become comatose from the Wisdom damage, the spirit gains control of your body (and can release itself whenever it desires).</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: If you are using the sanity system (page 12) and fail your Constitution check while harboring the spirit, you take sanity damage equal to 1/2 the spirit's CR (minimum 1) instead of 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. If you succeed at the Constitution check, you take sanity damage equal to 1/4 the spirit's CR instead of 1 point of Wisdom damage. Either way, you still take the normal amount of Constitution damage. No effect can prevent or reduce the damage, nor can it be healed or suppressed by any means until you release the spirit.</p>\n<h1>Aura Flare</h1>\n<p>You are able to flare your alignment aura to debilitate your foes.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Cha 13; aura, aura of good, or aura of evil class feature; channel energy 4d6; strong or overwhelming good or evil aura.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Once per day, when you channel energy, you are also able to cause your divine aura to flare in a display of overwhelming force, affecting all good creatures within the aura (if you channel negative energy) or all evil creatures in the aura (if you channel positive energy). This effect is in addition to the normal effects of channeling energy.</p>\n<p>When you flare your aura, select from one of the following options based on the strength of your alignment aura. You can select a lower-strength effect.</p>\n<p><em>Strong</em>: Affected creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your class level in the class granting you the channel energy ability + your Charisma bonus) or be fatigued for 1d4 rounds.</p>\n<p><em>Overwhelming</em>: Affected creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your class level in the class granting you the channel energy ability + your Charisma bonus) or be staggered for 1d4 rounds.</p>\n<h1>Blood Feast (Combat, Monster)</h1>\n<p>You become more aggressive and vicious when you taste living flesh and blood.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Bite attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you damage a living creature with your bite attack, you gain a +1 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls with your bite attack until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<h1>Blood Spurt (Combat)</h1>\n<p>When cut in combat, you spray your blood into the faces of your foes.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Base attack bonus +2, susceptibility to bleed damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Whenever a creature adjacent to you hits you with a melee attack that deals bleed damage, that creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Constitution modifier) or become blinded for 1d4 rounds as your blood sprays it in the face. Additionally, if you have a special ability that deals bleed damage (such as a rogue's bleeding strike rogue talent), as a standard action, you can deal 1 point of bleed damage to yourself to spray blood in the face of an adjacent creature of your choice, causing the same effect. The creature only needs to attempt the saving throw for the first of its attacks that deals bleed damage.</p>\n<h1>Bouncing Spell-Like Ability (Monster)</h1>\n<p>You can retarget one of your spell-like abilities when it fails to affect its original target.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Spell-like ability at caster level 4th or higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose one of your spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a bouncing spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).</p>\n<p>Whenever you use a bouncing spell-like ability against a single target and the ability has no effect on it (whether due to spell resistance or a successful saving throw), as a swift action, you can redirect the spell-like ability to target another eligible creature within range. The redirected spell-like ability behaves as if its new target were the original target for the spell-like ability. Spell-like abilities that affect a target in any way (including a lesser effect from a successful saving throw) can't be redirected in this manner.</p>\n<p>You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 1. For a summary, see Table 3-1.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.</p>\n<h1>Brutal Coup de Grace (Combat)</h1>\n<p>Your killing blows are so brutal that they scare other foes.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Dazzling Display, Weapon Focus, base attack bonus +5, proficiency with the selected weapon.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you deliver a coup de grace with the selected weapon and kill the target, enemies within 30 feet of you who can see or hear you must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma bonus) or become shaken. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>\n<h1>Brute Assault (Combat)</h1>\n<p>With brute force, you can bowl over and cripple opponents by treading on them.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Str 23, Int 13, Brute StompX, Brute StyleX, Combat Reflexes, Improved Overrun, Improved Trip, Improved Unarmed Strike, Vicious Stomp(UC), base attack bonus +10.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: While using Brute Style, when you successfully perform an overrun or trip combat maneuver against an opponent that causes that opponent to fall prone, your opponent takes 1d6 points of Strength damage, and its base speed is halved until the Strength damage is healed. A successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + your base attack bonus) reduces the Strength damage to 1 point and negates the movement speed reduction.</p>\n<h1>Brute Stomp (Combat)</h1>\n<p>Few can avoid the brutal violence of your bone-crushing kicks and stomps.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Str 19, Int 13, Brute StyleX, Combat Reflexes, Improved Overrun, Improved Trip, Improved Unarmed Strike, Vicious Stomp(UC), base attack bonus +8.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: While using Brute Style, when you make a full attack with a prone opponent adjacent to you that includes at least one unarmed strike, you can make an additional unarmed strike at your highest base attack bonus against that prone creature. These additional attacks don't stack with those granted by Medusa's Wrath, and this does not allow you to make an additional attack against a creature you tripped during your full attack. Additionally, you can use your Vicious Stomp feat against any opponent within your natural reach regardless of whether it falls prone adjacent to you.</p>\n<h1>Brute Style (Combat, Style)</h1>\n<p>Through strength, study, and intense inner reflection, you have become an expert at battering fallen opponents.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Str 15, Int 13, Combat Reflexes, Improved Overrun, Improved Trip, Improved Unarmed Strike, Vicious Stomp(UC), base attack bonus +6.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: While using this style, you can use your Vicious Stomp feat against any opponent within 10 feet of you, as long as it is within your natural reach. If you don't have the Vicious Stomp feat, you gain no benefit from this feat.</p>\n<p><strong>Normal</strong>: The Vicious Stomp feat only works against an opponent that falls prone adjacent to you.</p>\n<h1>Bully Breed</h1>\n<p>Your animal companion can terrify as well as fight.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Handle Animal 4 ranks, Intimidate 4 ranks, animal companion or mount class feature.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your animal companion or mount gains Intimidate as a class skill. It can attempt to demoralize an opponent using the Intimidate skill as a move action on the same round that it damages an opponent with a natural attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: Your animal companion can select the Dazzling Display and Shatter Defenses feats if it meets the prerequisites. This feat does not allow your animal companion to use Intimidate to make a target friendly or gain their assistance.</p>\n<p><strong>Normal</strong>: Animal companions and mounts with an Intelligence score of 2 or less must select feats from a limited list.</p>\n<h1>Clarity of Pain</h1>\n<p>You can inflict pain upon yourself to sharpen your focus.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Con 13, Improved Iron Will, Iron Will.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Three times per day, as an immediate action when you fail a saving throw against a charm or compulsion effect, you can inflict 1d6 points of slashing, piercing, or bludgeoning damage to yourself in order to reroll that saving throw. You can't reroll the saving throw if you negate the damage, such as by having damage reduction greater than or equal to the damage you dealt to yourself; instead, you spend the immediate action and daily use of this feat but gain no benefit. You must take the result of the second roll, even if it is worse.</p>\n<h1>Consume Essence (Combat, Monster)</h1>\n<p>Creatures that you swallow are quickly absorbed and soon utterly annihilated.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Base attack bonus +6; evil alignment; swallow whole universal monster ability; must be of the magical beast, outsider, or undead type.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you start your turn having swallowed at least one creature, each swallowed creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or gain a temporary negative level. Swallowed creatures that die from these negative levels are consumed as per <em>disintegrate</em>. This is a death effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: If you are of the undead type, each time a swallowed creature gains a temporary negative level from this ability, you add 5 temporary hit points to the number of hit points that swallowed creatures must deal to escape, up to a maximum of 15 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for 10 minutes.</p>\n<h1>Contagious Spell (Metamagic)</h1>\n<p>Your spells are dangerous to dispel and likely to backfire upon those who try.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: A caster level check to dispel or remove a contagious spell that fails by 5 or more causes it to spread from the original target to the creature that attempted to remove it. The spell spreads to the new target regardless of its normal range or any special targeting requirement like a melee or ranged touch attack. The spell is treated as if you had just cast it on the new target. The new target receives a saving throw or the benefit of spell resistance (if applicable) if the spell normally allows it.</p>\n<p>You can apply Contagious Spell only to targeted spells that are harmful to their target and don't have a range of personal; a contagious spell never spreads to someone who would benefit from being the target of the spell. A contagious spell uses up a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell's actual level.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: A contagious spell can be identified normally as it is being cast with a successful Spellcraft check. Identifying whether a spell is contagious by its effect, however, requires the use of the <em>analyze dweomer </em>spell or a similar effect.</p>\n<h1>Deadhand Initiate (Combat)</h1>\n<p>Your adulation of death not only shields you from your fears, it allows you to feed on them.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Wis 19, Deadhand StyleX, Improved Unarmed Strike, Knowledge (religion) 6 ranks, ki pool class feature, nongood alignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: While using Deadhand Style, as long as you have at least 1 point in your ki pool, your bonus on saving throws against fear effects increases to +4, and the DC of Intimidate checks attempted against you increases by 8. Additionally, if an enemy targets you with a fear effect, you can spend 1 point from your ki pool as an immediate action to gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice your Hit Dice.</p>\n<h1>Deadhand Master (Combat)</h1>\n<p>Your death-infused punch drains life force from your foes.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Wis 23, Deadhand InitiateX, Deadhand StyleX, Improved Unarmed Strike, Knowledge (religion) 14 ranks, ki pool class feature, nongood alignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: While using Deadhand Style, when you damage a living creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 2 points from your ki pool as a swift action to inflict 2 temporary negative levels on your enemy with no saving throw. Effects that reduce the ki cost also reduce the number of negative levels you inflict on your foe, but effects that increase the ki cost do not increase the number of negative levels you inflict. As long as the foe is affected by the temporary negative levels, you can't recover the ki points you spent, effectively reducing the size of your ki pool. The Fortitude save DC to remove the negative levels and prevent them from becoming permanent is equal to 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Wisdom modifier. Once the negative levels become permanent or the foe removes them, you can recover your spent ki points. If the foe dies before either happens, you can recover the spent ki after 24 hours.</p>\n<h1>Deadhand Style (Combat, Style)</h1>\n<p>Your study of death allow you to exploit your foes' fears.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Wis 15, Improved Unarmed Strike, Knowledge (religion) 4 ranks, ki pool class feature, nongood alignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: While using this style, if you have at least 1 point in your ki pool, you gain a +2 bonus on saves against fear effects, and the DC of Intimidate checks against you increases by 4. As a swift action, you can spend 1 point from your ki pool to empower your unarmed strikes. Creatures hit with your unarmed strikes must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier) or become shaken for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>\n<h1>Disconcerting Knowledge</h1>\n<p>You unsettle your enemies by demonstrating that you how to defeat them.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Bardic knowledge class ability or Knowledge domain, Knowledge (any two) 3 ranks each.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can use your knowledge to demoralize an enemy. When you use a standard action to Intimidate a creature with a base CR of 2 or greater, you can use a Knowledge skill that could be used to identify the creature's type in place of Intimidate when attempting to demoralize that creature. The target creature must be intelligent and understand the language that you are using when conveying the disconcerting knowledge.</p>\n<h1>Disrupting Fist (Combat)</h1>\n<p>Your powerful fists can reduce undead foes to dust.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Channel Smite, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +9, channel positive energy 4d6.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: On a confirmed critical hit using an unarmed strike against an undead creature, you can expend two uses of your channel energy ability as a swift action to destroy that undead creature. The undead creature can negate this effect with a successful Will saving throw (DC = 10 + your base attack bonus).</p>\n<h1>Disruptive Spell-Like Ability (Monster)</h1>\n<p>Your spell-like ability clings to affected targets and interferes with their spellcasting.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Spell-like ability at caster level 4th or higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose one of your spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a disruptive spell-like ability up to three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).</p>\n<p>For 1 round after you use a disruptive spell-like ability, affected targets attempting to cast as spell must attempt concentration checks when casting spells or use spell-like abilities (DC = the disruptive spell-like ability's DC + the level of the spell the target is casting or spell-like ability it's using). Targets that avoid the spell-like ability's effects also avoid this feat's effect.</p>\n<p>You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 1. For a summary, see Table 3-1.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time you do, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.</p>\n<h1>Enemy Cult (Story)</h1>\n<p>You have crossed paths with a cult opposed to everything in which you believe.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: You must have encountered a cult whose general alignment is opposite to yours on at least one axis or who threatened your beliefs or way of life, or you must have the Angelic Encounter, the False Witness, The Omen, or the Terrible Secret background (all of which are found in <em>Ultimate Campaign</em>).</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose an appropriate <em>detect chaos/evil/good/law </em>spell that would aid you in opposing your chosen enemy cult. You can cast this spell twice per day as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to your character level.</p>\n<p><strong>Goal</strong>: Thwart the enemy cult, whose leader must be a challenging foe. You must deal that cult leader a decisive defeat, and additionally eradicate the cult or drive the cult from the area.</p>\n<p><strong>Completion Benefit</strong>: You gain a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against evil creatures and a +2 deflection bonus to AC against evil creatures' attacks. These bonuses double against evil summoned creatures.</p>\n<h1>Engulf Horror (Combat, Monster)</h1>\n<p>The repulsive horror of your smothering attack nearly incapacitates most foes.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Engulf RevulsionX; engulf or smother universal monster ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you successfully engulf or smother an opponent, successfully maintain a grapple combat maneuver on a smothered opponent, the opponent must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Strength modifier) or become staggered for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>\n<h1>Engulf Revulsion (Combat, Monster)</h1>\n<p>The stomach-churning terror of your smothering attack leaves creatures sick and weakened.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Engulf or smother universal monster ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you successfully engulf or smother an opponent, or successfully maintain a grapple combat maneuver on an engulfed or smothered opponent, that opponent must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Strength modifier) or become shaken for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>\n<h1>Exorcising Mutilation</h1>\n<p>Malevolent entities that seek to possess or dominate you are unaware of how far you will go to stop them.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Con 15, Clarity of PainX, Improved Iron Will, Iron Will.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you fail a saving throw to resist possession or a <em>dominate </em>spell, you can deal 4 points of Constitution damage to yourself and reroll your saving throw as an immediate action. You cannot reduce or negate this damage in any way, and the only way to heal the damage is through natural recovery; magical methods don't work. You must take the result of the second roll, even if it is worse. If you succeed at the second saving throw, you also become immune to that spell or ability from that creature for 24 hours. You must be wielding a lethal piercing or slashing weapon, or possess a claw natural attack or some way to draw such a weapon reactively without using your immediate action, to use this ability.</p>\n<h1>Exsanguinate (Combat, Monster)</h1>\n<p>You drink blood from the living at a furious rate, often draining creatures dry in a matter of seconds.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Blood drain universal monster ability, grab universal monster ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Once per round, when you successfully pin an opponent, that opponent takes double the normal damage from your blood drain.</p>\n<h1>Fear Eater</h1>\n<p>You eat the fear of others, freeing them from its effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Cha 13, Iron Will, have no immunity to fear effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a standard action, you can remove a fear effect from another creature by touching it. The fear effect is transferred from that creature to you, with the same remaining duration. If the fear effect has varying effects depending on the target (such as the effects of <em>cause fear </em>depending on the target's Hit Dice), it has the effect it had on the original creature or the effect it would have on you, whichever is more severe. When you choose to accept another creature's fear, you don't receive any saving throw, spell resistance, or other defenses you would normally have against the fear effect.</p>\n<h1>Fearsome Spell-Like Ability (Monster)</h1>\n<p>Your spell-like ability induces fear in affected targets.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Spell-like ability at caster level 6th or higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose one of your spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a fearsome spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).</p>\n<p>When a target takes damage from a fearsome spell-like ability and fails its saving throw against the spell-like ability, it becomes shaken for a number of rounds equal to the spell-like ability's equivalent spell level. If the spell-like ability doesn't allow a saving throw, creatures harmed by it can attempt a Will save (against the DC that the spell-like ability would have if it allowed a saving throw) to negate the shaken effect. If the effect of the spell-like ability also causes targets to become shaken and a target fails its saving throw, the duration of the shaken condition caused by this effect stacks with the spell-like ability's. A fearsome spell-like ability can't cause a creature to become frightened, even if that creature is already shaken.</p>\n<p>You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 2. For a summary, see Table 3-1.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.</p>\n<h1>Fleshwarper (Item Creation)</h1>\n<p>You can create creatures through an abominable alchemical process.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Craft (alchemy) 5 ranks, Heal 5 ranks, evil alignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can create fleshwarped creatures and fleshcraft grafts (see page 165). A newly created fleshwarped creature has average hit points for its Hit Dice.</p>\n<h1>Ghost Guide (Story)</h1>\n<p>You have made it your life's work to put the dead to rest.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: You have encountered a ghost or haunt, or have the Bones, the Died, the Raised Among the Dead, or The Dead One background (all of which are found in <em>Ultimate Campaign</em>).</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Whenever you communicate with a ghost or haunt, whether while adventuring or through use of spells such as <em>call spirit</em>(OA), <em>speak with haunt</em>(ACG),and <em>speak with dead</em>, or seances and talking boards, you gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks. The GM can also extend this benefit to any intelligent undead creature that has an interest in being laid to rest. If you have more than 10 ranks in either these skills, you instead gain a +4 bonus on the appropriate skill.</p>\n<p><strong>Goal</strong>: Lay an appropriate number of ghosts, haunts, and other undead creatures to rest. Laying to rest means fulfilling the actions described on a haunt's destruction line or doing what is required to prevent a ghost's rejuvenation. If the GM includes other types of undead, the GM decides what constitutes their final business.</p>\n<p><strong>Completion Benefits</strong>: You retain the normal benefit. Additionally, you increase your effective caster level by 2 when determining the effects of <em>call spirit</em>, <em>speak with haunt</em>, <em>speak with dead</em>. Finally, when a spirit lies to you, you can confront the spirit about the lie and force it to roll another saving throw against the spell's DC. If the spirit fails the saving throw, you receive an additional question to replace the one where the spirit gave a false answer.</p>\n<h1>Gruesome Shapechanger (Monster)</h1>\n<p>When you change shape, it is a violent and bloody affair.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Shapechanger subtype.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you change shape, your previous form sloughs off your body in a spray of blood and viscera that congeals into a thick, disgusting slime that dissolves within 24 hours. Until the slime dissolves or is cleaned in some way, the space where you stood when you changed (or the space below if you changed in mid-air) becomes slippery, counting as difficult terrain and increasing the DC of Acrobatics checks made in that area by 5. Any foe witnessing this gruesome shape change must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier) or be sickened for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: The gruesome way you change shape is tiring. Once you've used your change shape ability, you must wait 1d4 rounds before you can use it again. If you take this feat, it changes the way your shapechanging ability works; you cannot choose to avoid this feat's effects.</p>\n<h1>Horrific Gorging (Combat, Monster)</h1>\n<p>In the space of a few horrific seconds, you can chew up and gulp down an entire humanoid body.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Bite attack, Large or larger, swallow whole universal monster ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a full-round action, you can completely consume a dead, unconscious, paralyzed, or otherwise helpless humanoid creature that you could normally swallow with your swallow whole ability. When you do, you deal bite damage as a critical hit and swallow the humanoid as your swallow whole special ability.</p>\n<p>Allies of the swallowed creature within 30 feet that can see you indulge in this horrific feast must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) to avoid being shaken for 1d4 rounds. This part of the ability is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>\n<h1>Incorporeal Intuition</h1>\n<p>You notice incorporeal creatures, even those lurking in walls.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Psychic Sensitivity(OA) or the ability to cast psychic spells, Spirit Sense(OA).</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can sense the presence and movement of incorporeal creatures though solid walls, as long as that incorporeal creature is adjacent to you. When you sense a creature in this way, you can attempt a Knowledge (religion) check to identify the creature and its special powers or vulnerabilities, with a -5 penalty. When you sense an incorporeal creature with this ability and use a readied action to attack it when it attacks from inside the wall, it doesn't gain cover against your attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Normal</strong>: Incorporeal creatures are silent unless they choose to make a sound and are thus almost impossible to detect when inside a solid wall. When readying to attack an incorporeal creature in a solid wall, it gains cover against your attack.</p>\n<h1>Intensified Spell-Like Ability (Monster)</h1>\n<p>Your spell-like ability deals more damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Spell-like ability at caster level 4th or higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose one of your spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as an intensified spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).</p>\n<p>When you use an intensified spell-like ability, the maximum number of the ability's damage dice increases by 5 levels. You must have sufficient caster levels to surpass the normal maximum in order to benefit from this feat. No other variables of the spell-like ability are affected, and spell-like abilities that inflict damage that is not modified by caster level are not affected by this feat.</p>\n<p>You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 1. For a summary, see Table 3-1.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.</p>\n<h1>Kyton Cut (Combat)</h1>\n<p>You lash yourself and share the pain with your opponent.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Wis 17, Exotic Weapon Proficiency (spiked chain), Kyton ShieldX, Kyton StyleX, base attack bonus +8 or monk level 6th, Knowledge (planes) 3 ranks, ki pool class feature.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When using Kyton Style, your spiked chain attacks can be brutal, both to yourself and your foe. Before attempting an attack roll with a spiked chain attack, you can choose to make a Kyton Cut. Before making the attack, you take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. This damage cannot be avoided or reduced in any way. If you are immune to nonlethal damage, you take normal damage instead. If the attack hits, its target takes an additional 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and a -4 penalty on concentration checks for 1 round. The penalty is a pain(UM) effect.</p>\n<h1>Kyton Shield (Combat)</h1>\n<p>Whether in your hand or draped around your body, the spiked chain serves as both weapon and shield.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Wis 15, Exotic Weapon Proficiency (spiked chain), Kyton StyleX, base attack bonus +5, Knowledge (planes) 3 ranks, ki pool class feature.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When using Kyton Style, you gain a +1 shield bonus to your Armor Class as long as you are wielding a spiked chain. If the spiked chain is magical, add 1/2 its enhancement bonus to this shield bonus. If the spiked chain has the <em>vicious </em>ability, instead add its full enhancement bonus to the shield bonus.</p>\n<h1>Kyton Style (Combat, Style)</h1>\n<p>Your fighting style emulates the disciplined nature of the kytons, with passion and pain held tightly in chains.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Wis 13, Exotic Weapon Proficiency (spiked chain), Knowledge (planes) 3 ranks, ki pool class feature.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When using this style, you treat spiked chains as if they had the monk special weapon feature. Additionally, if you have Stunning Fist, you can spend 1 point from your ki pool to make a Stunning Fist attack with your spiked chain instead of an unarmed strike. This still costs a use of Stunning Fist as normal.</p>\n<h1>Latching Horror (Combat, Monster)</h1>\n<p>You induce fear and loathing when you latch onto another living creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Attach universal monster ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you use your attach ability, your opponent must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier) to avoid becoming shaken while you remain attached. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>\n<h1>Lifeless Gaze</h1>\n<p>Your cold visage and eyes devoid of sentiment cause fear in those making contact with your gaze.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Iron Will, Bluff 5 ranks.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your haunting gaze grants horrifying insights to the darker places of your inner psyche. You gain a +2 insight bonus on Will saving throws against emotion(UM) effects and a +2 insight bonus on Bluff checks. Additionally, if a humanoid creature attempts to read your mind using an ability like <em>detect thoughts</em>, it is shaken for 2d4 rounds regardless of whether the mind-reading attempt succeeds. If a humanoid fails a Diplomacy check against you by 5 or more, it becomes shaken for 2d4 rounds by your emotionless gaze.</p>\n<h1>Lingering Spell-Like Ability (Monster)</h1>\n<p>Your spell-like ability clings to existence, slowly fading from the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Spell-like ability at caster level 4th or higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose one of your spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a lingering spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).</p>\n<p>A lingering spell-like ability causes an instantaneous spell-like ability that affects an area to persist until the beginning of its next turn. Targets already in the area suffer no additional harm, but other creatures or objects entering the area are subject to its effects. A lingering spell-like ability with a visual manifestation obscures vision, providing concealment (20% miss chance) beyond 5 feet and total concealment (50% miss chance) beyond 20 feet.</p>\n<p>You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 1. For a summary, see Table 3-1.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.</p>\n<h1>Maddening Obliteration (Combat)</h1>\n<p>With a mighty killing blow, your unsettling punch vaporizes your foe.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Wis 19, Cha 15, Improved Unarmed Strike, Maddening StrikeX, Maddening StyleX, Stunning Fist, Knowledge (arcana) 10 ranks, ki pool class feature, nongood alignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you damage a living creature with an unarmed strike while using Maddening Style, and you have at least 1 point in your ki pool, that creature suffers a -2 penalty on saving throws against any confusion, madness, and insanity effects (including your Maddening Strike) for 1 round. Additionally, if you reduce a creature to fewer than 0 hit points with a Stunning Fist attack, you can spend 2 points from your ki pool as a free action to obliterate your opponent, reducing their body to fine dust as per <em>disintegrate</em>. A living creature can attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier) to negate this effect.</p>\n<h1>Maddening Strike (Combat)</h1>\n<p>Your fists are weapons of mind-devouring madness.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Wis 17, Cha 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, Maddening StyleX, Stunning Fist, Knowledge (arcana) 8 ranks, ki pool class feature, nongood alignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a swift action, you can spend 1 point from your ki pool to imbue the next unarmed strike you make on this turn with the maddening power of the spaces between the stars. If that attack doesn't hit, you take 2 points of Wisdom damage. If the attack hits, your opponent takes damage from your unarmed strike + 1d4+1 points of Wisdom damage. A successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier) reduces this to 2 points of Wisdom damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: If you are using the sanity system (page 12), when you miss with a Maddening Strike, you take 4 points of sanity damage. If you hit, the target takes damage from the unarmed strike plus 8 points of sanity damage (or 4 points of sanity damage on a successful Will save).</p>\n<h1>Maddening Style (Combat, Style)</h1>\n<p>When you clobber an opponent with your fists, you inundate its mind with visions of madness and horror.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Wis 15, Cha 11, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist, Knowledge (arcana) 4 ranks, ki pool class feature, nongood alignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You gain one additional use of Stunning Fist per day. When using this style, if you have at least 1 point in your ki pool, you increase the DCs of your confusion, madness, and insanity effects (including Maddening Strike) by 1. Additionally, when you successfully stun an opponent with your Stunning Fist attack, your target takes 1 point of Wisdom damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: If you are using the sanity system (page 12), when you successfully stun an opponent with your Stunning Fist attack, the target takes 1d4 points of sanity damage instead of 1 point of Wisdom damage.</p>\n<h1>Mutilating Ritualist</h1>\n<p>You add a personal sacrifice to heighten the power of your ritual magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Knowledge (arcana) 4 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 4 ranks, Spellcraft 4 ranks.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Once during the casting of an occult ritual (<em>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures </em>208), you can inflict 1d6 hit points of damage per 2 Hit Dice and 1d4 Constitution damage (or Charisma damage if you're undead) to yourself as an immediate action with a piercing or slashing weapon. You can't reduce or ignore this damage in any way. This damage doesn't disrupt the ritual, and you can roll twice for the next skill check made as part of a ritual casting and take the better result. If the resulting ritual effect has the fear descriptor or is in the phantasm subschool, increase its saving throw DC by 1. Multiple characters with this feat can each use it once per ritual on their skill checks, but the DC increases don't stack.</p>\n<h1>Profane Studies</h1>\n<p>Your study of fiends grants you advantages when summoning or fighting them.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Int 13, Knowledge (planes) 4 ranks, ability to cast a <em>summon monster </em>spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You gain a +5 bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks involving evil outsiders. Additionally, when you cast a <em>summon monster </em>spell to summon an evil outsider, treat your caster level as 2 levels higher for the purpose of determining the duration.</p>\n<h1>Protector of the People (Story)</h1>\n<p>You have vowed to construct a defender for your community.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Your community has come under persecution and requires considerable defense, or you have the Raiders, the Righting a Wrong, The War, or The Way Things Work background (all of which are found in <em>Ultimate Campaign</em>).</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You temporarily gain the Craft Construct feat for the purposes of building one golem to satisfy the goal of this story feat. You do not need to meet Craft Construct's prerequisites, and it can't be used as a prerequisite for any other crafting endeavor.</p>\n<p><strong>Goal</strong>: Craft a golem of CR 5 or greater and donate it to your community for its defense against persecution. You and your allies must fund the construction, not the community. You must be significantly involved in the golem's construction. After completion, this golem cannot be used as a personal adventuring companion; it is the property of the community to which it was dedicated. The donated creature must be a golem and not another type of construct, such as an animated object.</p>\n<p><strong>Completion Benefits</strong>: You gain Craft Construct as a bonus feat without meeting its prerequisites and can use it for any purpose. The cost to build any construct that normally costs less than the cost of your donated golem is permanently reduced by 10%; the cost of the base materials is not reduced, however.</p>\n<h1>Purging Emesis</h1>\n<p>You learn to purge toxins by vomiting.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Great Fortitude.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you can attempt to end an ingested poison effect by making yourself vomit. If you succeed at a new saving throw against the initial effect, you gain the nauseated condition for 1 round but end the poison effect as if you had succeeded at the requisite saving throws. Your vomiting causes one adjacent square to become slippery (<em>Core Rulebook </em>412) until your vomit is cleaned (usually taking 1 full round) or dries up (usually 1 hour). Once you use this feat, you must wait at least 1 hour and consume food or drink before you can use it again.</p>\n<h1>Putrid Summons</h1>\n<p>You summon creatures whose very presence turns the stomach of your foes.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Spell Focus (conjuration); ability to cast <em>summon monster </em>or <em>summon nature's ally</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you cast a <em>summon monster </em>or <em>summon nature's ally </em>spell, you can choose to summon a single creature that exudes a putrid odor or befouls the water surrounding it, granting it the stench universal monster ability. The duration of the sickened condition created by this stench is a number of rounds equal to the spell's level. When performing a putrid summon, you summon a creature from the next lower list than the spell you are casting. For instance, if you cast <em>summon monster IV</em>, you summon a creature from the <em>summon monster III </em>list.</p>\n<h1>Reach Spell-Like Ability (Monster)</h1>\n<p>You can use a spell-like ability at a greater range.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Spell-like ability at caster level 4th or higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose one of your spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a reach spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).</p>\n<p>When you use a reach spell-like ability, it can alter a spell-like ability with a range of touch, close, or medium to increase its range to a higher range category, using the following order: touch, close, medium, and long. You can select a spell-like ability that duplicates a spell only if its level is less than or equal to 1/2 its caster level (round down) - 1 per increase in range category. For example, a spell-like ability with a range of touch can be increased to long range only if it duplicates a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 3. For a summary, see Table 3-3. Reach spell-like abilities that normally require melee touch attacks instead require ranged touch attacks.</p>\n<p>Spell-like abilities that do not have a range of touch, close, or medium do not benefit from this feat.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.</p>\n<h1>Table 3-3: Reach Spell-Like Ability [Range Increase (by Spell Level)]</h1>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Caster Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>0</strong></td>\n<td><strong>1st</strong></td>\n<td><strong>2nd</strong></td>\n<td><strong>3rd</strong></td>\n<td><strong>4th</strong></td>\n<td><strong>5th</strong></td>\n<td><strong>6th</strong></td>\n<td><strong>7th</strong></td>\n<td><strong>8th</strong></td>\n<td><strong>9th</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12th</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16th</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18th</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20th</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1>Sacrificial Adept</h1>\n<p>The deaths of living, sentient creatures fuel your spells and heighten their potency.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Knowledge (arcana) 4 ranks, Knowledge (planes) 4 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 4 ranks, Spellcraft 4 ranks, ability to cast 3rd-level spells, evil alignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: By partaking in a heinous ritual that takes at least 10 minutes to complete and which requires you to perform a successful coup de grace upon a sacrifice, you can enhance the power of a single spell you know or have prepared for the next 24 hours, regardless of how many times you cast it within that period. Your sacrifice must be a sentient creature with a total number of Hit Dice greater than or equal to your caster level, and it must die from your coup de grace; if it doesn't die or comes back to life, you lose all benefits related to that sacrifice.</p>\n<p>After successfully performing the ritual, you choose the spell that the ritual enhances and gain your choice of a +2 bonus to any attack rolls and combat maneuvers made with that spell or a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance with that spell for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>You can perform this ritual a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier, but you cannot affect the same spell more than once at a time.</p>\n<h1>Sacrificial Ritualist</h1>\n<p>Your magical power used to originate in yourself, but now you draw it from others.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Mutilating RitualistX, Knowledge (arcana) 4 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 4 ranks, Spellcraft 4 ranks.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You can improve your ability to cast an occult ritual (<em>Occult Adventures </em>208) by powering it with the blood of creatures. When you begin the occult ritual with the death of a sentient creature (or number of sentient creatures with a total number of Hit Dice equal to twice the effective level of the ritual), you and all secondary casters gain a +4 bonus on all skill checks necessary to complete the occult ritual. This feat's sacrifices are in addition to any sacrifices normally required to complete the ritual.</p>\n<h1>Scarring Spell-Like Ability (Monster)</h1>\n<p>Your spell-like ability leaves mental scars.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Spell-like ability at caster level 4th or higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose one of your spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a scarring spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).</p>\n<p>When you use a scarring spell-like ability, a target that fails its saving throw against the spell-like ability takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against emotion and fear effects you create, and a -1 penalty on saving throws against other emotion and fear effects, for the next 24 hours. If the spell-like ability doesn't allow a saving throw, you can't choose to enhance it with this feat. Penalties from multiple scarring spell-like abilities don't stack. This feat can be applied only to spell-like abilities with the emotion(UM) or fear descriptor.</p>\n<p>You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 1. For a summary, see Table 3-1.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.</p>\n<h1>Shatter Control (Combat)</h1>\n<p>You can infuse your attacks with divine power capable of harming the undead and shattering the bond between the undead and its controller.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Channel positive energy 4d6.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a special full-round action, you can make a single melee attack against an undead creature or a single ranged attack against an undead creature within 30 feet. If the attack is successful, you deal your normal damage with the melee or ranged attack to your undead target. If the target undead creature is being controlled by another, by way of spell, because the target undead creature is an unintelligent undead controlled by that creature, or is under command of another undead creature, and if the controlling creature is within 120 feet of you when you make the attack, the controlling creature must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your level + your Cha modifier) or immediately lose control of the targeted undead for 10 minutes. While under this effect, the targeted undead is immediately compelled to seek out and attack its former controller until the control is regained.</p>\n<h1>Sickening Spell-Like Ability (Monster)</h1>\n<p>Your spell-like ability sickens affected targets.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Spell-like ability at caster level 6th or higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose one of your spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a sickening spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).</p>\n<p>When you use a sickening spell-like ability, a target that takes damage from the spell-like ability becomes sickened for a number of rounds equal to the spell-like ability's equivalent spell level. If the spell-like ability allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the sickening effect. If the spell does not allow a saving throw, the target can attempt a Fortitude save (against the DC that the spell-like ability would have if it allowed a saving throw) to negate the sickening effect. If the effect of the spell-like ability also causes targets to become sickened and targets fail their save, add the duration of the sickened condition caused by this effect to the duration of the sickened condition imposed by the spell-like ability.</p>\n<p>Spell-like abilities that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this feat.</p>\n<p>You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 2. For a summary, see Table 3-1.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.</p>\n<h1>Skin Suit (Monster)</h1>\n<p>During the daylight hours, you can cloak your unnatural form beneath a veil of flesh and blood.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Int 7, undead creature that was originally humanoid.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Once per day as a full-round action, you can cloak your body in a thin, fleshy suit that gives you the appearance of yourself as a young adult humanoid. Your appearance changes as per <em>alter self</em>, but this feat doesn't adjust your ability scores or grant any new abilities. When so disguised, you cannot use slashing or piercing natural attacks, such as bite or claw attacks, without unraveling and destroying your skin suit, nor can you deliver energy drain or ability damage with your undead special attacks (such as a wight or vampire's slam attacks) without destroying the suit. While wearing a skin suit, your alignment is masked as though by a constant <em>undetectable alignment </em>spell, and you have the aura of a living creature instead of an undead creature for the purposes of <em>detect undead </em>and similar effects. The skin suit dissolves into a puddle of bloody slurry at sundown, though you can remove it at any time as a standard action. The skin suit does not protect you from the effects of being exposed to direct sunlight. Finally, if you take lethal damage while wearing your skin suit, you must succeed at a Reflex save with a DC equal to the amount of lethal damage or the skin suit is destroyed.</p>\n<h1>Spawnlink (Monster)</h1>\n<p>You can see through the eyes of your spawned minions.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Int 13, create spawn monster ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a full-round action, you can create a link with one of your spawn that you control on the same plane. When you do so, your spawn's eyes glow bright red. When linked in this way, you can see through your spawn's eyes with either the spawn's vision or yours, whichever is more beneficial. While looking through your spawn's eyes, your body is blinded.</p>\n<p>You can also speak though your spawn (if it can speak), using your own voice. You can maintain this link each round as a standard action as if concentrating to maintain a 3rd-level spell. If your spawn is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points while you use this ability, you become blinded and dazed for 1d6 rounds with no saving throw.</p>\n<h1>Spirit Speaker</h1>\n<p>By absorbing spirits, you can learn how to set them free.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Cha 13, Con 13, Absorb SpiritX, Diplomacy 5 ranks, must have died at least once or been possessed by an undead creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you absorb a spirit with the Absorb Spirit feat, you can converse with it through an internal dialogue in your mind. While conversing with the spirit, you can attempt Diplomacy checks to change its attitude toward you, as a normal use of that skill. If you are a medium with the haunt channeler(OA) class feature, you gain a +4 bonus on these Diplomacy checks. Once the spirit's attitude is indifferent or better, you can request to know what must be done to lay the spirit to rest, though the DC to do so is the DC to change its current attitude + 15. This takes into account the circumstance modifiers for the request in a typical situation, though it could be higher or lower in an unusual circumstance.</p>\n<p>The spirit's starting attitude is usually hostile since you destroyed it and imprisoned it within you, interfering with its rejuvenation. If it's the spirit of an undead creature, it has the same Charisma bonus it had while fully manifested. If the spirit is that of a haunt, it has an effective Charisma based on its CR using the following table.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Haunt CR</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Effective Charisma (Modifier)</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1-4</td>\n<td>12 (+1)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5-8</td>\n<td>16 (+3)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9-12</td>\n<td>20 (+5)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13-16</td>\n<td>24 (+7)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17-20</td>\n<td>28 (+9)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>21+</td>\n<td>32 (+11)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Conversing with a spirit in this manner unsettles the mind. Each time you attempt a Diplomacy check using this ability to influence the spirit's attitude or make a request, you take 1 point of Wisdom damage. No effect can prevent or reduce the ability damage, nor can the ability damage be healed or suppressed by any means until you release the spirit.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: If you are using the sanity system (page 12), when you attempt a Diplomacy check using this ability, you take 1d6 points of sanity damage instead of 1 point of Wisdom damage. No effect can prevent or reduce the damage, nor can the damage be healed or suppressed by any means until you release the spirit.</p>\n<h1>Stubborn Curse</h1>\n<p>Your curses are particularly tenacious.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Ability to cast a spell or spell-like ability with the curse(UM) descriptor, or a special ability with a curse effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Any curse effect you create is difficult to remove. When a creature makes a caster level check to remove the curse, it must roll twice and take the worse result.</p>\n<h1>Touch of Evil</h1>\n<p>You instill unbidden thoughts and desires into another with your touch.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Channel negative energy 6d6, evil alignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a standard action, you can expend three uses of your channel negative energy and make a melee touch attack against a target. You can attempt an opposed Sleight of Hand check against the target's Perception to make this attack without the target noticing. If the attack hits, the target gets a Will save (DC=10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma modifier). On a failed save, you implant a suggestion into the creature's mind. This works similar to the <em>suggestion </em>spell, however, you can suggest to the creature to commit a harmful or destructive act against another creature or object. If you choose the latter, the creature attempts to carry out the suggestion in 1d6+1 days as it thinks over the suggestion and plans it out. The creature can attempt another Will save at the original DC to resist the suggestion right before it carries it out. If it fails the save, it gains a +4 circumstance bonus on one die roll used in carrying out the suggestion. This relentless planning causes the creature 1 point of Wisdom damage (or 1d6 sanity damage, if you are using that system), until the suggestion is carried out.</p>\n<h1>Traumatic Spell-Like Ability (Monster)</h1>\n<p>Your spell-like ability causes affected targets to relive their torments in nightly terrors.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Spell-like ability at caster level 6th or higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Choose one of your spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a traumatic spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).</p>\n<p>When you use a traumatic spell-like ability, affected targets must succeed at an additional Will saving throw the next time that they sleep (DC = the spell-like ability's DC) or be affected as per <em>nightmare</em>. Each time the target fails its save, it must save again the following night or be affected by another <em>nightmare</em>, though the save DC decreases by 2 each night after the first. This feat can be applied only to spell-like abilities with the emotion or fear descriptor. Targets that avoid the spell-like ability's effects avoid this feat's effect as well.</p>\n<p>You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 2. For a summary, see Table 3-1.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you are able to apply it to a different spell-like ability.</p>\n<h1>Twisted Love (Story)</h1>\n<p>An evil person or entity has become obsessed with your resemblance to a lost loved one.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: You resemble a lost loved one of an evil creature who would otherwise be a challenging foe. The likeness is close enough for you to be mistaken as the former loved one's reincarnation, or you might be that loved one reborn in a new life. Alternately, the creature might be a former lover who has become evil and wishes to resume the relationship. This unwanted relationship must be contrary to your alignment or long-term goals. Thematically appropriate backgrounds include Born out of Time, Current Lover, Reincarnated, The Lover, and Troubled First Love (all of which are found in <em>Ultimate Campaign</em>).</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment effects and a +2 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks to influence your would-be love or her minions and servants.</p>\n<p><strong>Goal</strong>: You must break the heart of your pursuer in a dramatic and significant manner. This requires you to interact closely and frequently enough with the entity to cause her to become emotionally compromised or vulnerable. A simple rebuff or refusal of her affections is insufficient to satisfy this goal and might only further drive the obsessed creature to capture you, cast <em>charm </em>spells upon you, corrupt you, or transform you in a way that would make you more sympathetic to her.</p>\n<p><strong>Completion Benefit</strong>: You retain your +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment effects. If you succeed at a Will save against such an effect, the caster does not learn that you succeeded at your saving throw (effects such as <em>detect magic </em>and <em>analyze dweomer </em>still work normally). However, this benefit doesn't inform you of the nature of the effect cast upon you. The spurned entity might later seek revenge for the humiliation but is no longer obsessed with you. You also receive the completion benefit even if the formerly obsessed entity is slain, though you never receive the benefit if the entity perishes before you can achieve your goal.</p>\n<h1>Unyielding Ferocity (Combat)</h1>\n<p>When near the brink of death, you fight ferociously until the bitter end.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Con 19, ferocity.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: When you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, if you remain conscious from your ferocity monster ability, you can make a full attack on your next turn (or your current turn if you are reduced to 0 hit points on your own turn). If you do, you push your body to the point that your mind becomes more primitive, and you can no longer use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, or Ride, or any ability that requires patience or concentration (such as spellcasting) until your hit points are raised above 0.</p>\n<p><strong>Normal</strong>: When using the ferocity ability, you are staggered while you have fewer than 0 hit points and thus can't make a full attack.</p>\n<h1>Zealous Mind</h1>\n<p>You are so steadfast in the principles of your alignment, even magic has difficult swaying you.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Iron Will, Unimpeachable Honor(UI), lawful alignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Whenever you are under the effect of a charm or compulsion effect cast by or coming from a source with a chaotic alignment or an alignment on the good and evil axis opposite of your alignment (evil if you are good, and good if you are evil) you gain a +2 on any saving throw or opposed Charisma check to break free from the effect. This bonus stacks with itself and with the bonus granted by Unimpeachable Honor.</p>"}

Chapter 2: Archetypes And Class Options}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The science of alchemy allows its practitioners to create wonders beyond the imagining, but sometimes the pursuit of science breaks their minds, and other times, the allure of greater achievements pushes them to cross a moral line from which they can never return.</p>\n<h1>Blood Alchemist (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Most alchemists can transform matter and energy into other forms, but some wicked specialists realize that life itself is an energy that can greatly fuel their alchemy.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: A blood alchemist trades the lives of others for more power when using his lifeblood ability. A nonevil blood alchemist can't use the lifeblood ability, but he can use his other archetype and class abilities, and he can continue to advance in alchemist.</p>\n<p><strong>Lifeblood (Su)</strong>: When a blood alchemist performs a coup de grace that kills an intelligent humanoid creature (though, not a summoned intelligent humanoid creature), he can gather its lifeblood into a vial; this is a death effect. He can use this lifeblood any time within the next 24 hours to create an extract of a spell level he can cast that is no higher than 1/2 the creature's CR, without spending a daily extract slot. He can use this ability once for each spell level each day (for example, a 13th-level blood alchemist can use lifeblood to gain additional 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd-, 4th-, and 5th-level extracts). A blood alchemist can't take the mutagen(UM) or cognatogen(UM) discoveries.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces mutagen.</p>\n<p><strong>Alchemical Circles (Sp, Su)</strong>: A blood alchemist gains a blood pool with a number of points equal to his alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier. He can spend 1 point from his blood pool to draw a complex alchemical circle in blood on the ground or on another permanent fixture in a process that takes 1 minute. Depending on his alchemist level, the alchemical circle can have one of several effects.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, the blood alchemist can spend an unused extract slot to charge the circle with alchemical energy. He chooses one of the spells listed on page 45 of equal or lower level to the extract slot he spent, and until he refreshes his extract slots, as long as his body is in physical contact with the circle, he can produce the effect of the spell he chose as a spell-like ability. If the spell normally has an expensive material component, he must still provide it, either grinding it up and mixing it with the blood used for the circle or placing it in the circle (if the component is also the target). The chosen effect can target or affect only something contained within the circle, or the surface on which the blood alchemist drew the circle. To learn one of these effects, he must write it into his formula book, with the same cost as usual for a formula (he can also use his free formula from leveling up to learn the chosen effect instead of a normal formula).</p>\n<p>The blood alchemist can choose from the following spells for this ability: 1st-<em>expeditious excavation</em>(APG), <em>fabricate bullets</em>(UC), <em>jury-rig</em>(UC), <em>magic weapon</em>, <em>reinforce armaments</em>(UC); 2nd-<em>knock</em>, <em>make whole</em>, <em>masterwork transformation</em>(UM), <em>silk to steel</em>(UM), <em>soften earth and stone</em>, <em>warp wood</em>; 3rd-<em>keen edge</em>, <em>magic vestment</em>, <em>greater magic weapon</em>, <em>obsidian flow</em>(UC), <em>spike stones</em>, <em>stone shape</em>; 4th-<em>fabricate</em>, <em>passwall</em>, <em>transmute mud to rock</em>, <em>transmute rock to mud</em>; 5th-<em>flesh to stone</em>, <em>move earth</em>, <em>stone to flesh</em>, <em>tar pool</em>(UC), <em>transmute metal to wood</em>; 6th-<em>polymorph any object</em>, <em>transmute blood to acid</em>(UM).</p>\n<p>Starting at 8th level, the blood alchemist can also create a magic circle, as per the magic circles occultist class ability (<em>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures </em>49), though it costs 1 point from his blood pool instead of 1 point of mental focus.</p>\n<p>Starting at 12th level, he can also create a binding circle, as per the occultist class ability of the same name (<em>Occult Adventures </em>49), though it costs 2 points from his blood pool instead of 2 points of mental focus.</p>\n<p>Starting at 16th level, the blood alchemist can draw magic circles and binding circles more quickly but with a shorter duration, as per the occultist fast circles ability (<em>Occult Adventures </em>49).</p>\n<p>This ability replaces bombs.</p>\n<p><strong>Blood Knowledge (Sp)</strong>: Starting at 4th level, a blood alchemist can spend an unused extract slot of 2nd level while mixing a drop of blood with various alchemical reagents in a process that takes 1 minute. If he does so, he can drink the resulting concoction as a standard action to gain the information he would learn as if he had cast <em>blood biography</em>(APG) on the blood he just used. As per the spell, living and undead creatures receive a Will saving throw (DC = 13 + the blood alchemist's Intelligence modifier) to negate the effect.</p>\n<h1>Mad Scientist (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>The mad scientist's colleagues laughed at her insights, mocked her theories, and hounded her from the halls of academia, simply because they were too weak and frightened to understand her work. They thought she was finished. They were wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>Mad Genius (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a mad scientist can deal 1d3 points of Wisdom damage to herself (or 1d6 points of sanity damage if employing the sanity rules found on page 12) to create a genius extract as one of her daily 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd-, 4th-, or 5th-level extracts. This otherwise takes the same amount of time and effort as creating a normal extract of its level, but instead of her choosing a formula she knows for it to grant, a genius extract has an unpredictable result. When the alchemist (or an ally, if she has the infusion(APG) discovery) drinks the extract, it produces a random effect from the list of alchemist formulae on page 32 of the <em>Advanced Player's Guide </em>of 1 spell level higher than the extract's spell level.</p>\n<p>For instance, if she creates a genius extract using a 2nd-level extract, it would produce the effect of a random 3rd-level alchemist formula. There is no way to predict which effect a genius extract will produce before drinking it. A genius extract's minimum caster level is equal to the minimum caster level of the extract used, not the effect produced. So, for instance, a genius extract that produced a <em>fox's cunning </em>effect would have a minimum caster level of 1 (for the 1st-level extract used) rather than 4 (for the 2nd-level effect). There are 29 potential 2nd-level extracts, 23 potential 3rd-level extracts, 18 potential 4th-level extracts, 15 potential 5th-level extracts, and 15 potential 6th-level extracts.</p>\n<p>This ability alters alchemy and replaces the discovery gained at 2nd level.</p>\n<p><strong>Mad Mutagen (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, a mad scientist can brew a mad mutagen in place of a normal mutagen. If she does so, she need not make any decisions about the mutagen (including whether to make it a cognatogen(UM) or another variant mutagen if she has the appropriate discoveries) when she brews it. When the mad scientist drinks her mad mutagen, she makes those decisions on the fly, but she also takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage (or 1d8 points of sanity damage if using the sanity rules on page 12). If anyone else, even another alchemist, drinks a mad mutagen, that person must succeed at a Will save (with the same DC as for the Fortitude save against nausea) or she becomes confused for 1 hour.</p>\n<p>This ability alters the alchemist's mutagen and replaces the discovery gained at 4th level.</p>\n<p>^Archetypes and Class Options Feats</p>"}

Chapter 5: Horror Rules}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Diseases hold great potential for horror. They often strike at abilities or traits people value dearly but take for granted. They can leave victims unable to walk or speak, radically change a person's appearance, and, of course, claim lives. They are impossible to see with the naked eye, and for most of human history, they were poorly understood. Perhaps worst of all, for adventurers, they cannot be fought in the traditional sense and are completely impervious to violence or reason.</p>\n<p>While standard diseases in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game challenge players and make for good storytelling opportunities, they are typically telegraphed days in advance with the first Fortitude save and easily cured with low-level spells. Further, very few diseases are even capable of killing, and often they do nothing more alarming than dealing ability score damage. However, there are worse diseases brewing in the world. This section contains new options for diseases, including a collection of templates that can be applied to any disease to make it more frightening in a variety of ways, and a selection of new diseases that progress through a series of horrifying symptoms, similar to the diseases from pages 138-141 of <em>Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained</em>.</p>\n<h1>DISEASE TEMPLATES</h1>\n<p>Not all strains of the same disease are identical. Diseases mutate and change over time, so the PCs may encounter local strains of devil chills, filth fever, and other diseases that are different from those with which they're familiar. These different strains might be particularly fast-acting, easier to spread, resistant to treatment, or otherwise improved over the default version of the disease. The following section presents several templates that can be applied to any disease to represent more dangerous strains. These templates function similarly to creature templates, and several templates can be applied to the same disease to create a truly horrifying plague. The special properties of a disease with a template are difficult to predict without special training. Unless a character spends at least an hour examining the disease and its victims and then succeeds at a Heal check (DC = the disease's save DC + 10), she identifies the disease as its more common variant, without realizing the differences.</p>\n<h1>INCURABLE</h1>\n<p><em>An incurable disease is all but impossible to cure completely, even with the aid of magic. The incurable template can be added to any disease. The disease retains its base statistics except as noted below. </em></p>\n<p><strong>Save </strong>The disease's saving throw DC is reduced by 5.</p>\n<p><strong>Cure </strong>The disease cannot be cured with any number of successful saving throws. Whenever the afflicted creature succeeds at a saving throw to resist the disease's effects by 5 or more, you automatically succeed at your next saving throw against the disease's effects as well. Even spells that can normally cure diseases only cause the disease to become dormant for 2d4 days, after which the affected creature must begin attempting saving throws to resist the disease's effects once more. Only powerful magic like a <em>miracle </em>or a <em>wish </em>is sufficient to completely cure a creature of an incurable disease.</p>\n<h1>LETHAL</h1>\n<p><em>A lethal disease attacks the host's body with ruthless efficiency. The lethal template can be added to any disease. The disease retains its base statistics except as noted below. </em></p>\n<p><strong>Save </strong>With each failed saving throw, the DC of any future saves by the affected creature to resist the disease's effects increase by 1. These increases stack to a maximum of 5.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>Any Constitution damage or Constitution drain dealt by the disease increases by 2. Otherwise, in addition to its normal effect, the disease also deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage.</p>\n<h1>LINGERING</h1>\n<p><em>A lingering disease is one that tends to remain with its victims for a long time and is difficult to cure completely. The lingering template can be added to any disease. The disease retains its base statistics except as noted below. </em></p>\n<p><strong>Save </strong>The disease's saving throw DC increases by 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>Any ability score damage or drain dealt by the disease is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 1).</p>\n<p><strong>Cure </strong>The number of consecutive successful saving throws required for the victim to be cured of the disease increases to double the normal amount.</p>\n<p><strong>Special </strong>Any effect that would cause a creature suffering from the disease to be cured of it (including <em>remove disease</em>) instead counts as a single successful save for the purposes of curing the disease through consecutive saving throws. No more than 1 successful save can be accrued in this way within a single period of the disease's frequency (1 day, for most diseases), even if multiple effects would cure the creature of its disease. Finally, even if a creature is completely cured of the disease, small amounts of it remain within its system, and there is a 30% chance per day that the creature becomes reinfected, and must succeed at a new saving throw or contract the disease again. This chance decreases by 5% per day, until it reaches 0%.</p>\n<h1>MAGIC-RESISTANT</h1>\n<p><em>A magic-resistant disease is protected against magical treatment. Sometimes this is because the disease has a magical origin or has been infused with magic, and sometimes it's because the organisms that cause the disease simply react differently to magic than most infectious organisms do. The magic-resistant template can be added to any disease. The disease retains its base statistics except as noted below. </em></p>\n<p><strong>Save </strong>The disease can affect creatures that have Constitution scores and are normally immune to disease, whether that immunity comes from a racial trait, class feature, spell, magic item, or other source. However, such creatures receive a +4 bonus on saving throws when attempting to resist the disease's effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Cure </strong>The disease is particularly difficult to remove using magic. <em>Remove disease </em>can't cure the disease, and even more powerful spells such as <em>heal </em>require a successful caster level check with a -10 penalty (DC = the disease's save DC) to remove the disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Special </strong>The disease responds violently to any attempts to heal it using magic. Whenever the diseased creature is subject to a spell or ability that cures diseases, it must succeed at a Fortitude save or suffer the disease's effect. This does not reset the disease's frequency, and succeeding at this check does not count toward the number of consecutive saves required to be cured of the disease.</p>\n<h1>PLAGUE</h1>\n<p><em>A plague is a disease that spreads very effectively, and can easily pass through an entire community in a short period of time. If left unchecked, plagues can ravage entire cities or regions, and in the case of particularly deadly or virulent plagues, can potentially even bring an end to mighty civilizations. The plague template can be added to any disease. The disease retains its base statistics except as noted below. </em></p>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>If the disease's type is ingested, it instead changes to inhaled. If its type is injury, it instead changes to contact. If its type is contact or inhaled, it remains the same.</p>\n<p><strong>Save </strong>The initial saving throw DC to resist the disease increases by 5. The saving throw remains the same for all subsequent saving throws to resist the disease's effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Special </strong>Simple contact with or, in the case of inhaled diseases, spending time near a creature infected with a plague can expose others to the disease. If the plague is an inhaled disease, then a creature afflicted with the disease creates an aura of disease around it. Any coughing, sneezing, and in some cases, even breathing releases clouds of disease-causing organisms into the air. Any creature that comes within 30 feet of the diseased creature is exposed to the plague, and must succeed at a Fortitude save or begin suffering its effects. A potential victim must attempt a new save each time it moves within 30 feet of a diseased creature, to a maximum of one saving throw every 10 minutes. Any creatures that remains within 30 feet of the diseased creature must attempt a new saving throw every 10 minutes. If the plague is a contact disease, each time a creature touches the diseased creature, or touches an object that was touched by the diseased creature in the last 24 hours, the potential victim is exposed to the plague, and must succeed at a Fortitude save or begin suffering its effects.</p>\n<h1>RAVAGING</h1>\n<p><em>A ravaging disease is one whose effects are particularly difficult to heal, and that can permanently scar creatures affected by it. The ravaging template can be added to any disease. The disease retains its base statistics except as noted below. </em></p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>If the disease deals ability damage, each time the affected creature fails a saving throw to resist the disease's effects by 5 or more, 1 point of that ability score damage becomes permanent ability score drain instead. If the affected creature rolls a natural 1 on a saving throw to resist the disease's effects, all of the ability score damage becomes permanent ability score drain.</p>\n<p><strong>Cure </strong>The number of consecutive successful saves required to be cured of the disease increases by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Special </strong>Ability score damage and drain dealt by the disease cannot be healed as long as the affected creature is still infected by the disease. This applies both to natural healing and magical healing (such as <em>lesser restoration</em>).</p>\n<h1>VIRULENT</h1>\n<p><em>A virulent disease is particularly fast-acting, and runs its course in hours, rather than days. While this could mean the disease runs its course more quickly, leaving the victim disease-free, virulent diseases are particularly taxing on their victims and often end in death. The virulent template can be added to any disease. The disease retains its base statistics except as noted below. </em></p>\n<p><strong>Onset </strong>If the disease's onset is normally measured in weeks, it is instead measured in days. If it is normally measured in days, it is measured in hours. If it is normally measured in hours, it is measured in minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency </strong>If the disease's frequency is normally measured in weeks, it is instead measured in days. If it is normally measured in days, it is instead measured in hours. If it is normally measured in hours, it is instead measured in minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>If the disease doesn't already deal Constitution damage on a failed save, it deals 1 point of Constitution damage in addition to its normal effect on each failed save. If it normally deals Constitution damage, increase the Constitution damage by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Special </strong>If the diseased creature fails two consecutive saving throws, it is sickened until the next time it succeeds at a saving throw to resist the disease's effects. If the diseased creature fails four consecutive saving throws, it is nauseated until the next time it succeeds at a saving throw to resist the disease's effects. These penalties are in addition to any other effects of the disease, and cannot be removed as long as the creature remains diseased. Even if the creature is normally immune to the sickened or nauseated condition, that condition still applies; only immunity to diseases protects against gaining the condition from a virulent disease.</p>\n<h1>NEW DISEASES</h1>\n<p>The following diseases blend the traditional style of diseases found in the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook </em>with the disease progressions found in <em>Pathfinder Unchained</em>. Each of these diseases progresses through a series of stages, from carrier to terminal, and each stage comes with its own horrifying symptoms. The DC listed for each disease is a baseline for the most common form of the disease, but higher-DC strains of these diseases exist, especially in the vicinity of disease-bearing monsters and plague-worshiping cultists.</p>\n<p>These diseases do not have onset periods. When the affected creature fails its initial save and becomes infected with the disease, it immediately moves into the first stage of the disease, which is carrier, though it doesn't suffer the disease's effect. After this, the affected creature attempts subsequent saving throws at regular intervals, defined by the disease's frequency, just like any other disease. Whenever the affected creature fails a subsequent saving throw against the disease, it suffers the disease's listed effect and also moves to the next stage of the disease (progressing from carrier to early, early to moderate, and so on). As long as the affected creature remains diseased, it suffers all of the effects listed for its current stage, as well as the effects of any previous stages. When the affected creature reaches the terminal stage, it can no longer fulfill the cure condition without magic; most creatures don't survive long at this stage. Whenever the affected creature fulfills the cure condition listed for the disease, it moves to the previous stage of the disease. If this would cause it to move to a stage prior to carrier, it is completely cured of the disease. Any effect that would normally completely cure the affected creature of a disease (such as a <em>remove disease </em>spell) similarly moves the affected creature to the previous stage of the disease instead.</p>\n<p>Several of these diseases impose certain conditions at various stages. These conditions can't be cured as long as the affected creature remains at that stage or a worse stage, even by effects that would normally be able to do so. These effects typically end automatically once the creature is cured of the disease or moves to a less severe stage. Only immunity to disease can prevent these conditions; no other immunities apply against these conditions. Occasionally, a disease might even have an effect that is permanent, and persists once the disease is cured. In these cases, the effect's description states what measures (if any) can undo the effect, but these measures are generally effective only once the disease has been cured.</p>\n<h1>BLOODY END</h1>\n<p><em>This disease causes the body to produce blood filled with sanguine humours and adrenaline, making the victim incredibly violent and savage. It is spread by contact with the tainted blood-so while it is safe to touch creatures in the early stages of the disease, coming into contact with even the smallest amount of a diseased creature's blood allows the disease to spread. </em></p>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>disease, contact; <strong>Save </strong>Fortitude DC 20, see text</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency </strong>1/hour</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>-2 penalty to AC and on Reflex saves and Will saves for 1 hour; <strong>Cure </strong>2 consecutive saves</p>\n<h1>STAGES</h1>\n<p><strong>Carrier </strong>The affected creature becomes more irritable and aggressive than normal, but otherwise there are no symptoms of the disease at this stage.</p>\n<p><strong>Early </strong>The affected creature's skin darkens, and the creature's attitude worsens, making it prone to violent outbursts. The affected creature gains a +1 alchemical bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls, and takes a -2 penalty to its Armor Class.</p>\n<p>Its tainted blood is unable to clot, and rushes out of even minor wounds. Whenever the affected creature takes at least 5 points of piercing or slashing damage, it also takes 2 points of bleed damage. This bleed damage stacks with other bleed damage, including itself. Whenever the affected creature takes bleed damage in this way, a thin but far-reaching spray of blood erupts from the wound, exposing all creatures in a 15-foot cone (pointing toward the source of the attack) to the disease unless they succeed at Reflex saving throws at the disease's DC.</p>\n<p><strong>Moderate </strong>Blood begins to ooze through the affected creature's pores, coating its skin in a thin, red sheen. The alchemical bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls increases to +2, and the penalty to the creature's Armor Class becomes -4. Whenever the affected creature takes damage, it must succeed at a Will save at the disease's DC or fly into a berserk rage, in which it is compelled to attack the nearest creature each round for 1 minute, regardless of whether it's a friend or foe. The amount of bleed damage the affected creature takes after being dealt 5 or more points of piercing or slashing damage increases to 5.</p>\n<p><strong>Severe </strong>The affected creature is constantly staggered. Additionally, the berserker rage caused by the disease clouds the mind of the affected creature, which is constantly compelled to attack the nearest creature. The affected creature can attempt a Will save at the disease's DC as a free action to suppress this effect for 1 minute, but if it fails this save, it can't try again for 1 hour; even if it succeeds, it must continue to attempt a save whenever it takes damage to avoid flying back into a berserk state.</p>\n<p><strong>Terminal </strong>The affected creature can no longer attempt a saving throw to suppress its rage. If it fails a saving throw against the disease's progress at this stage, it dies. Even on a successful saving throw, the affected creature takes 10d10 points of damage and 2 points of Constitution drain. If the affected creature dies at this stage, its body explodes in a shower of gore, exposing all creatures within 20 feet to the disease unless they succeed at Reflex saves at the disease's DC.</p>\n<h1>BRAIN MOSS</h1>\n<p><em>This bright blue fungus grows inside the brain tissue of a living creature, altering the brain's chemistry to make the host docile, and eventually consuming the host's brain while it is still alive. In severe cases of the disease, telltale blue fuzz can often be found growing out of the victim's ears and nostrils. </em></p>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>disease, inhaled; <strong>Save </strong>Fortitude DC 16, see text</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency </strong>1/day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>-2 penalty on Will saves and Wisdom-based skill checks and ability checks for 1 day; <strong>Cure </strong>2 consecutive saves</p>\n<h1>STAGES</h1>\n<p><strong>Carrier </strong>At this stage, the affected creature experiences colors and sounds with more intensity than it normally would, but there are otherwise no effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Early </strong>The affected creature's mind is flooded with calming chemicals, which put the creature in a tranquil, calm state. The affected creature cannot gain any morale bonuses or penalties, and it takes a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. Additionally, the creature takes a -4 penalty on Sense Motive checks, as the brain moss interferes with critical thinking</p>\n<p><strong>Moderate </strong>The affected creature becomes placid and incredibly impressionable. It cannot take hostile actions, although whenever another creature takes a hostile action against the affected creature, it can attempt a Will save at the disease's DC to suppress this effect for 1 minute. Additionally, whenever anyone makes a request of the affected creature, it must succeed at a Will save at the disease's DC or be compelled to perform the request, similar to a creature that failed a saving throw against the <em>suggestion </em>spell, except this suggestibility is a nonmagical disease effect (not a spell, spell-like ability, enchantment, or compulsion).</p>\n<p><strong>Severe </strong>The fungus begins to cause intense hallucinations in the affected creature, making it constantly confused. Additionally, once every 1d4 hours, it has a hallucination that causes it to be dazed for 1 minute, after which time it must succeed at a Will save at the disease's DC or be compelled to perform an act chosen by the GM or determined at random, as a result of the delusions (similar to the effect at the moderate stage).</p>\n<p><strong>Terminal </strong>The fungus begins to consume the brain tissue of the affected creature, whose brain can no longer control its body. The affected creature falls unconscious and remains unconscious for as long as it remains at this stage of the disease. If it fails a saving throw against the disease's progress at this stage, it dies. Even if it succeeds at a saving throw at this stage, it takes 4 points of Constitution and Intelligence damage.</p>\n<h1>GHOUL DISTEMPER</h1>\n<p><em>This rare, tropical disease causes living creatures to turn into feral, ghoul-like entities, and when fatal, often causes the affected creature to rise as a ghoul. The creature's metabolism rises at an incredible rate, forcing it to devour untenable amounts of food. Eating only further fuels the disease, and all victims of this affliction quickly develop an emaciated, corpselike appearance. </em></p>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>disease, ingested, inhaled, or injury; <strong>Save </strong>Fortitude DC 18, see text</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency </strong>1/day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>-2 penalty on Fortitude and Will saves for 1 day; <strong>Cure </strong>2 consecutive saves</p>\n<h1>STAGES</h1>\n<p><strong>Carrier </strong>The affected creature becomes voraciously hungry, and must consume double the normal amount of food each day it remains at this stage or risk starvation.</p>\n<p><strong>Early </strong>The affected creature's skin turns a deep shade of yellow, while the creature's temperature begins to rise. Additionally, the affected creature's ravenous appetite worsens. As long as it remains at this stage of the disease or worse, it treats each hour as though it were a full day for the purposes of the frequency and amount of food it must eat in order to avoid starvation (including time spent sleeping). Finally, it develops a strong craving for raw meat, and must consume at least 4 ounces of uncooked meat per hour or become sickened until it does so.</p>\n<p><strong>Moderate </strong>The affected creature's body begins to quickly waste away, as muscle and fat are consumed to feed its growing hunger. Further, its body begins to constantly exude a stench of rotting meat, which cannot be removed with any amount of bathing. The affected creature is constantly sickened. Additionally, whenever the creature takes nonlethal damage from starvation, it takes 3d6 points of damage, rather than 1d6. Finally, whenever it comes within 10 feet of any amount of meat, including the bodies of slain creatures, it must succeed at a Will save against the disease's DC or be compelled to spend 1 minute gorging itself on the meat.</p>\n<p><strong>Severe </strong>The affected creature's teeth begin to grow and twist painfully, fusing together to form four massive fangs. The creature gains a primary bite natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if Small). Further, its hunger-addled mind drives it to favor this attack over all others. It can no longer cast spells or use other activated special abilities, nor can it use manufactured weapons; it is able to make only full attacks with its bite and other natural attacks. Finally, whenever the affected creature takes nonlethal damage from starvation, it takes 6d6 points of damage, rather than 1d6.</p>\n<p><strong>Terminal </strong>The affected creature completely loses control. It is compelled to attack any living creature it encounters in an attempt to devour its victim's flesh, preferably while still alive. Player characters who reach this stage are under the GM's control until they are cured. Additionally, whenever the affected creature takes nonlethal damage from starvation, it also takes 2 points of Constitution damage. If it fails a saving throw against the disease's progress at this stage, it dies. A creature that dies while at this stage of the disease rises as a ghoul (or ghast, if it had 5 or more Hit Dice) after 24 hours.</p>\n<h1>GORE WORMS</h1>\n<p><em>These parasites derive their name from their habit of devouring their hosts from the inside, leaving them as putrid sacs of blood and worms. Gore worms release their microscopic eggs in sporelike clouds that make their way into the bloodstream when inhaled. Eventually, the eggs anchor themselves within a host's body and grow until they reach nearly 2 inches in length. Adults burrow out through the host's skin and release their eggs into the air. The worms cannot survive outside of a host for more than a few hours, though they can inhabit corpses as easily as living creatures. </em></p>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>disease, inhaled; <strong>Save </strong>Fortitude DC 20</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency </strong>1/day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>-2 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and Fortitude saves for 1 day; <strong>Cure </strong>magic only</p>\n<h1>STAGES</h1>\n<p><strong>Carrier </strong>The gore worm eggs travel throughout the creature's body via its circulatory system. The affected creature doesn't suffer any particular symptoms at this stage.</p>\n<p><strong>Early </strong>The affected creature develops swelling, blisterlike growths that ooze blood and are incredibly painful when touched. Whenever the creature takes bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, it takes 1d6 additional points of nonlethal damage. Additionally, if the creature is wearing armor, then whenever it takes a standard action, it takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage, or 2d6 points if wearing heavy armor.</p>\n<p><strong>Moderate </strong>The gore worms hatch. The affected creature can feel them writhing and moving beneath its skin, and others can even see the worms moving occasionally. The affected creature is constantly sickened. Furthermore, whenever it takes more than a single standard or move action in a round, the worms roil angrily, causing the host to become nauseated for 1d4 rounds afterward. Finally, magical healing greatly agitates the worms, and whenever the affected creature is the target of a spell with the healing subschool, the worms whip into a frenzy, dealing 2 points of Constitution damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Severe </strong>The gore worms burrow holes through the affected creature's skin and extend portions of their bodies out into the air, giving the appearance that the affected creature's body has been covered in dozens of tiny gaping mouths with serpentine tongues. The affected creature is constantly staggered and exhausted.</p>\n<p><strong>Terminal </strong>The gore worms begin devouring the affected creature's internal organs. The affected creature is constantly nauseated. If it fails a saving throw against the disease's progress at this stage, it dies. Even if it succeeds, it takes 10d10 points of damage and 2 points of Constitution drain, in addition to the disease's normal effects.</p>\n<h1>SKIN WASTES</h1>\n<p><em>This disease brings intense itching, then hardening and cracking of the skin, and eventually the transformation of all soft tissue to bone. </em></p>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>disease, contact; <strong>Save </strong>Fortitude DC 20, see text</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency </strong>1/hour</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>-2 penalty to AC and on Fortitude and Reflex saves for 1 hour; <strong>Cure </strong>2 consecutive saves</p>\n<h1>STAGES</h1>\n<p><strong>Carrier </strong>The affected creature suffers from itchy, irritating skin, and localized, splotchy rashes. At this stage, the disease has no mechanical effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Early </strong>The affected creature's skin becomes gray and flaky.</p>\n<p>The itchiness caused by the disease worsens, and the creature must succeed at a Will save at the disease's DC each waking hour or frantically spend much of that hour scratching away at its skin.</p>\n<p>For each failed Will save after the first in the same day, the creature takes 1d6 points of damage, as its scratching begins to break the skin and leave bloody gouges.</p>\n<p><strong>Moderate </strong>The itching intensifies, and the amount of damage dealt by scratching increases to 1d8. Additionally, during combat and other stressful situations, the affected creature must scratch its skin each round as a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Each round, the affected creature can suppress the need to scratch that round with a successful Will save at the disease's DC, but if it attempts the saving throw and fails, it spends the entire round scratching.</p>\n<p><strong>Severe </strong>The affected creature's skin becomes cracked and broken, and even moving is incredibly painful. As long as the creature remains at this stage, the affected creature is sickened and staggered. Additionally, whenever the affected creature takes damage, it takes double the amount of damage it normally would.</p>\n<p><strong>Terminal </strong>The affected creature's skin and organs slowly transform into solid bone, until eventually the creature is effectively petrified. The creature is constantly nauseated. For the first 24 hours at this stage, its Dexterity score is reduced by 1 each hour. During this time, its skin and organs transform into a single, solid mass of bone. Once its Dexterity score reaches 0 or after 24 hours have passed, it is petrified. A <em>stone to flesh </em>spell can undo the petrification, but the creature must immediately succeed at a Fortitude save against the disease's DC to survive the change. Even if it does, its Dexterity is again reduced by 1 each hour, and it eventually becomes petrified once more unless cured of the disease.</p>\n<p>^Horror Rules Running Horror Adventures</p>"}

Once the target is being strangled, the wielder can attempt a combat maneuver check as a standard action to squeeze the air out of the victim's lungs. This reduces the amount of time the victim can hold his breath by 1d6+1 rounds.</p>\n<p>A victim can escape the noose with a successful Escape Artist check (DC = the wielder's CMD), or by severing the noose with an attack or a successful sunder combat maneuver check.

Expending the trapped life energy ends the <em>death knell </em>effect immediately, before the casting of the sacrificial spell is complete, so the <em>death knell </em>effect doesn't increase the wielder's caster level for that spell.

Chapter 8: Bestiary}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Any monster can be a dangerous threat, but what makes a monster truly horrific? At the heart of the matter, a true horror monster needs to take the players' sense of humanity and undermine it in some way, stripping away civilization and reason. A savage lycanthrope takes away control and brings forth the animal within. A doppelganger or possessing spirit cuts away a sense of self, taking the victim's place among family and friends.</p>\n<p>The relationship between the PCs and monsters requires complexity for a theme of horror to shine. When running a horror game, think of monsters as more than a collection of statistics, and spend time creating atmosphere before a monster attack or encounter. The PCs might meet with monsters they're incapable of defeating, forcing them to parley or run. A monster might subtly influence the PCs in their dreams or by using magic over time before they ever meet. Even figuring out what's happening and revealing the existence of the monster might take time, or cost sanity as the PCs discover darker and darker secrets.</p>\n<h1>Corruption and Monsters</h1>\n<p>If you're using the corruptions from Chapter 1 in your game, the following related monsters are particularly thematic.</p>\n<p><strong>Accursed</strong>: Hags, typically green hags, night hags, and annis hags(B3).</p>\n<p><strong>Deep One</strong>: Deep ones(B5), deep one hybrids(B5), and deep one elders(B5).</p>\n<p><strong>Ghoul</strong>: Ghouls, ghasts, and possibly Leng ghouls(B5).</p>\n<p><strong>Hellbound</strong>: Devils, especially those focused on seduction and corruption over combat.</p>\n<p><strong>Hive</strong>: Hive swarms, hive warriors, and hive queens, all appearing later in this chapter.</p>\n<p><strong>Lich</strong>: Liches and demiliches(B3), though spellcasters can be susceptible even if they have no contact with liches.</p>\n<p><strong>Lycanthropy</strong>: Lycanthropes and some magical beasts.</p>\n<p><strong>Possessed</strong>: Shadow demons, ghosts, haunts, and other creatures with possession abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Promethean</strong>: Flesh golems, alchemists(APG), and creatures that spread disease, such as mummies.</p>\n<p><strong>Shadowbound</strong>: Kytons, nightshades(B2), owbs(B4), shadow fey (such as svartalfarB4), and various aberrations.</p>\n<p><strong>Vampirism</strong>: Vampires, including jiang-shis(B3) and nosferatu(B4).</p>\n<h1>Horror Monsters in Other Sources</h1>\n<p>The following lists collect monsters from the <em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </em>volumes to help you locate monsters to use in a horror-themed game.

The new hive subtype appears here. The kyton subtype, used by the apostle kyton, is repeated here for convenience.</p>\n<h1>Hive</h1>\n<p>The hive are an invasive species of aberrations that consume worlds like locusts. Hive creatures have the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Immunity to acid.</li>\n<li><strong>Blind</strong>: A hive creature is blind. It is immune to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight. Unlike other aberrations, a hive creature doesn't have darkvision.</li>\n<li>Blindsense 60 feet.</li>\n<li>Blindsight 10 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Corrosive Blood (Ex)</strong>: A hive creature's blood is highly caustic. Every time the hive creature is damaged by a piercing or slashing weapon, the attacking creature takes acid damage according to the table below (or double damage if the attack is a critical hit). Using a reach weapon does not endanger the attacker in this way. If the hive creature has the swallow whole ability, it adds this damage to its swallow whole damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size of Hive Creature</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Points of Acid Damage</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium or smaller</td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>1d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Colossal</td>\n<td>2d8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Death Throes (Ex)</strong>: When a hive creature dies, it exudes a pool of its corrosive blood in the space it occupies. This pool deals 1d6 points of acid damage per Hit Die of the hive creature for 3 rounds to objects and creatures in those squares (Reflex half ). This acid damages whatever surface it is on, and if it deals enough damage to destroy the surface, the acid falls down to any subsequent floor below and continues to deal damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.</li>\n<li><strong>Heat Adaptability (Ex)</strong>: Hive creatures are considered to always be under the effect of <em>endure elements </em>with regard to hot climates.</li>\n<li><strong>Hive Mind (Ex)</strong>: Hive creatures have no language of their own, instead communicating simple concepts via pheromone discharge and body language that other creatures with the hive subtype understand. This ability functions within line of sight. If one hive creature is able to act in the surprise round of combat, all other hive creatures in line of sight can also act, and a hive creature isn't flanked unless all hive creatures within line of sight are flanked.</li>\n<li>A hive creature doesn't need to eat, drink, or sleep.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Kyton</h1>\n<p>Kytons are a race of lawful evil outsiders native to the Plane of Shadow who feed on fear and pain. Kytons have the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Immunity to cold.</li>\n<li>Darkvision 60 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Regeneration (Ex)</strong>: The extent of a kyton's regeneration varies according to type, and can be neutralized by good weapons, good spells, and silver weapons.</li>\n<li><strong>Unnerving Gaze (Su)</strong>: All kytons have a gaze attack that manipulates the perceptions of those who look upon them. An unnerving gaze has a range of 30 feet, and can be negated by a Will save-the exact effects caused by a particular kyton's unnerving gaze depend on the type of kyton. All kytons are immune to the unnerving gazes of other kytons. Unnerving gaze is always a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

Chapter 1: Horror Characters}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Horror is common to all intelligent species, but the specific things they find terrifying vary from race to race. Dismembered bodies that would make a halfling lose his appetite might stir an ancestral bloodlust in the heart of a half-orc. Yet even the most battle-hardened half-orc fears horrors that transcend flesh and blood.</p>\n<p>Every race has its own historical or mythical fears skulking just out of sight. Dwarves often dwell close to ghouls and unnameable creatures haunting the depths. Gnomes know that not all from the fey realm are kindly, and they also fear the inhabitants of its dark reflection, the Shadow Plane.</p>\n<p>The greatest horror for any race, though, is the monster that hides within. Unchecked greed has led many dwarves astray, and not a few gnomes have been lost to their obsessions. Elves fight zealously against demons because they know how easily the taint of evil can transform them. Humans are often surprised to discover what creatures lurk in their family trees.</p>\n<p>Full rules for alternate racial traits and favored class options are found on pages 8-9 of the <em>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide</em>. Remember that alternate racial traits are not a category of traits (those are called race traits).</p>\n<h1>DWARF</h1>\n<p>Dwarves might be stalwart defenders against underground horrors or misers who hoard riches as jealously as any dragon.</p>\n<h1>Alternate Racial Traits</h1>\n<p>Dwarves can select the following racial traits.</p>\n<p><strong>Barrow Scholar</strong>: Dwarves with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on Knowledge (religion) checks to identify undead and can attempt them untrained. This racial trait replaces stonecunning.</p>\n<p><strong>Barrow Warden</strong>: Dwarves with this racial trait gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to their AC against undead. This racial trait replaces defensive training and hatred.</p>\n<p><strong>Healthy</strong>: Dwarves with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on saves against disease and poison, and they need one fewer consecutive successful save (minimum 1) to be cured of diseases and poisons. This racial trait replaces hardy.</p>\n<p><strong>Sense Aberration</strong>: Dwarves with this trait gain a +2 racial bonus on Knowledge (dungeoneering) checks and on Perception checks to notice disguised or hidden aberrations. This racial trait replaced stonecunning.</p>\n<p><strong>Tightfisted</strong>: Dwarves with this racial trait gain a +4 racial bonus to their CMD against disarm and steal(APG) combat maneuvers and a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks to notice Sleight of Hand attempts. If a dwarf with this trait notices a Sleight of Hand attempt to steal from him and the dwarf is not flat-footed or has Combat Reflexes, the attempt triggers an attack of opportunity from that dwarf. This racial trait replaces stability and stonecunning.</p>\n<p><strong>Viscous Blood</strong>: Dwarves with this trait takes 1 less point of hit point damage, ability damage, or ability drain (minimum 1) from bleed and blood drain.

In addition, when entering a dreamscape in a lucid body (<em>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures </em>241), a half-elf with this racial trait treats her Charisma score as 2 points higher for the purpose of effects related to the Dimension of Dreams. This racial trait replaces elven immunities.</p>\n<p><strong>Mismatched</strong>: Rather than having bodily and facial features that are a blend of elven and human, or tending towards one parent or the other, a rare few half-elves have a strange combination of features. They have noticeable mismatched eyes and ears, as well as uneven limbs. Half-elves with this trait take a -2 penalty on Reflex saves but receive a +4 racial bonus on initiative checks. This racial trait replaces keen senses and low-light vision.</p>\n<p><strong>Multidisciplined</strong>: Born to two races, half-elves have a knack for combining different magical traditions. If a half-elf with this racial trait has spellcasting abilities from at least two different classes, the effects of spells she casts from all her classes are calculated as though her caster level were 1 level higher, to a maximum of her character level. This racial trait replaces multitalented.</p>\n<p><strong>Round Ears</strong>: Sometimes half-elves are born with no obvious elven features.

Add 1/2 to the number of uses per day of that revelation.</p>\n<p><strong>Ranger</strong>: The duration of the ranger's companion bond increases by 1 round.</p>\n<h1>HALF-ORC</h1>\n<p>Some half-orcs draw on their experience to protect others from cruelty, while others inflict their own suffering on the world.</p>\n<h1>Alternate Racial Traits</h1>\n<p>Half-orcs can select the following racial traits.</p>\n<p><strong>Inured</strong>: Half-orcs raised by orcs often become desensitized to the violence around them. Half-orcs with this trait gain a +4 bonus on Will saving throws to avoid sanity damage (see page 12) caused by encountering monsters, extreme violence, or death. This racial trait replaces orc ferocity.</p>\n<p><strong>Monstrous Sympathy</strong>: Some half-orcs know how monsters think. They receive a +2 racial bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive checks against evil creatures. This racial trait replaces intimidating and orc ferocity.</p>\n<p><strong>Pain Tolerance</strong>: Some half-orcs have an increased tolerance for pain. They gain DR 1/- against nonlethal damage and receive a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects with the pain(UM) descriptor. This racial talent replaces intimidating and orc ferocity.</p>\n<p><strong>Projection</strong>: Some half-orcs channel negative emotions through magic. The DCs of any saving throws against spells with the fear or pain(UM) descriptor they cast increase by 1. This racial trait replaces orc ferocity and weapon familiarity.</p>\n<p><strong>Smog Sight</strong>: Half-orcs with this racial trait can see double the normal range in dense fog and smoke (including magic effects like <em>obscuring mist</em>) and ignore concealment from smoke or fog for targets within 5 feet. This racial trait replaces darkvision.</p>\n<p><strong>Stoic</strong>: Some half-orcs learn to suppress their strong emotions. They don't usually gain morale bonuses, but instead gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against emotion and fear effects, and the DC to intimidate them increases by 2. They can choose to gain morale bonuses when they would normally be able to do so, but if they do, they lose the benefits from this racial trait for 24 hours. This racial trait replaces intimidating and orc ferocity.</p>\n<h1>Favored Class Options</h1>\n<p>The following options are available to half-orcs.</p>\n<p><strong>Alchemist</strong>: Gain a +1/2 bonus on Strength checks to break objects and on sunder combat maneuver checks when under the effects of a mutagen that increases the alchemist's Strength or Constitution score.</p>\n<p><strong>Bard</strong>: Gain a +1/2 bonus on Bluff checks to pass secret messages, Sense Motive checks to discern secret messages, and Linguistic checks to decipher unusual handwriting.</p>\n<p><strong>Fighter</strong>: The fighter gains 1/2 point of DR/- against nonlethal damage (maximum DR 10/-).</p>\n<h1>HALFLING</h1>\n<p>Halflings are surprisingly resistant to malign influence, but when they do turn evil, it is all the more shocking.</p>\n<h1>Alternate Racial Traits</h1>\n<p>Halflings can select the following racial traits.</p>\n<p><strong>Acquisitive</strong>: Halflings with this trait receive a +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks. This bonus increases to +4 when used to determine the most valuable item visible in a treasure hoard.

This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by halfling luck. This racial trait replaces fearless.</p>\n<p><strong>Creepy Doll</strong>: Glassy eyes and porcelain skin make some halflings look more like dolls than living creatures. If they cease moving and pretend to be a doll while they aren't being observed, they can use the Stealth skill without cover or concealment. A successful Stealth check still allows other creatures to notice the halfling; they just believe the halfling is a doll, similar to the freeze universal monster ability (without being able to take 20). In addition, they take no size penalty on Intimidate checks against larger humanoids. The racial trait replaces keen senses and sure-footed.</p>\n<p><strong>Deep Jungle</strong>: Some reclusive halfling tribes flourish in tropical locales. These halflings begin play speaking only Halfling (in addition to any additional languages gained from having a high Intelligence score), rather than Common and Halfling. They gain a +2 racial bonus on Survival checks and are proficient with blowguns. In addition, they have the poison use ability (they never risk poisoning themselves accidentally). This racial trait alters halflings' languages and replaces sure-footed and weapon familiarity.</p>\n<p><strong>Irrepressible</strong>: Halflings with this trait receive a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against dominate and possession effects. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by halfling luck. This racial trait replaces fearless.</p>\n<p><strong>Resourceful</strong>: Halflings with this trait do not take any penalties for using improvised weapons. This trait counts as the Catch Off Guard or Throw Anything feats for the purpose of qualifying for feats. This racial talent replaces sure-footed and weapon familiarity.</p>\n<h1>Favored Class Options</h1>\n<p>The following options are available to halflings.</p>\n<p><strong>Barbarian</strong>: Add 1 foot to the range increment of thrown weapons the barbarian wields. This option has no effect unless the barbarian has selected it 5 times (or another increment of 5).</p>\n<p><strong>Cavalier</strong>: The cavalier's mount gains a +1/2 bonus on saving throws against fear effects. If the cavalier ever replaces his mount, the new mount gains this bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Monk</strong>: Gain a +1/4 bonus to CMD against trip and on damage rolls against prone targets that add the monk's Strength modifier.</p>\n<h1>HUMAN</h1>\n<p>The human mind is powerful enough to unlock the secrets of the universe, yet too fragile to accept what it discovers. Human bodies that appear out of the ordinary may bear traces of inhuman ancestry.</p>\n<h1>Alternate Racial Traits</h1>\n<p>Humans can select the following racial traits.</p>\n<p><strong>Aquatic Ancestry</strong>: Humans with deep one or skum ancestry may exhibit prominent round eyes or webbed fingers and toes. They gain a racial bonus equal to half their character level on Swim checks and Swim is always a class skill for them. In addition, they can hold their breath for twice as long as normal. When the racial bonus on Swim checks from this ability becomes +8 or higher, they can always take 10 on Swim checks, even when threatened or distracted. This racial trait replaces skilled<strong>. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Giant Ancestry</strong>: Humans with ogre or troll ancestry end up having hulking builds and asymmetrical features. Such humans gain a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD, but a -2 penalty on Stealth checks. This racial trait replaces skilled.</p>\n<p><strong>Piety</strong>: Humans place great trust in the gods to protect them. Humans with this trait receive a +2 racial bonus on Knowledge (religion) checks and Knowledge (religion) is always a class skill for them. In addition, once per day before attempting an attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or skill check, such a human can call out to his deity in order to receive a +2 racial bonus on that roll; he can use this ability only if he is able to speak. This racial trait replaces the bonus feat racial trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Psychic Defense</strong>: Humans from cultures steeped in the occult sometimes train their minds to resist outside influence. They gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against psychic spells and spell-like abilities, including those that originate from the psychic magic ability (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 5 </em>297). This racial trait replaces the bonus feat trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Rationalize</strong>: Humans have the ability to assuage their own fears by convincing themselves that what they saw or read is not real. Humans with this trait gain a +3 bonus on saving throws against effects that cause sanity damage (see page 12). This racial trait replaces the bonus feat trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Reptilian Ancestry</strong>: Humans with reptoid or serpentfolk ancestry sometimes have nictitating membranes or patches of scaly skin. They gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects and poisons. This racial trait replaces the bonus feat trait.</p>\n<h1>Favored Class Options</h1>\n<p>The following options are available to all humans who have the listed favored class.</p>\n<p><strong>Inquisitor</strong>: Add a +1/2 bonus on Perception checks to see through magical disguises or pinpoint invisible creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Occultist</strong>: Add a +1/3 bonus on any skill check attempted as a part of an occult ritual (<em>Occult Adventures </em>208).</p>\n<p><strong>Psychic</strong>: Add a +1/4 bonus to AC when flat-footed, to a maximum of what the psychic's AC would be if not flat-footed.</p>"}

Chapter 7: Horror Gear And Magic Items}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The following are specific examples of cursed items. Instead of prerequisites for construction, a typical cursed item is associated with one or more ordinary magic items whose creation might result in the cursed item. Cursed items can be sold as if they were the items they appear to be, provided the curse is not known to the buyer (occasionally, unscrupulous shopkeeps sell known cursed items; see page 142 for more information).</p>\n<h1>BOOK OF PERILOUS JOURNEYS</h1>\n<p><strong>SLOT</strong> none <strong>CL</strong> 13th <strong>WEIGHT</strong> 1/2 lb.</p>\n<p><strong>AURA</strong> strong conjuration</p>\n<p>This leather-bound book looks like a journal partially ruined by moisture. The pages that are still legible detail three violent events that apparently took place while the writer was traveling through an unknown land. There are several varieties of the book, each describing a perilous journey through a different terrain type corresponding to the encounter tables on page 324 of the <em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em>.</p>\n<p>Reading any of the three accounts triggers the curse, after which the reader is compelled to protect the book at all costs and secretly read the other two accounts over the next 2 days. Each day the owner reads one of the accounts, monsters of a type appropriate to the book's terrain attack during the night. Determine the specific monsters by rolling on the appropriate encounter tables. If the prevailing weather is vastly different from typical weather in the climate described in the journal, a sudden change in weather usually heralds the arrival of the monsters (as per <em>control weather</em>).</p>\n<p>Once the three attacks are over, the book mysteriously vanishes, lifting the curse. The book reappears later, however, at a random location.</p>\n<h1>INTENDED MAGIC ITEM</h1>\n<p><em>monster almanac </em>(see page 221)</p>\n<h1>NEEDFUL DOLL</h1>\n<p><strong>SLOT</strong> none <strong>CL</strong> 13th <strong>WEIGHT</strong> 1 lb.</p>\n<p><strong>AURA</strong> strong conjuration and illusion.</p>\n<p>When a humanoid creature picks up this ugly old doll, he triggers a horrible curse. Thereafter, the cursed doll considers that creature its owner. If the owner leaves the doll, it appears next to him the next time he sleeps.</p>\n<p>The doll is vindictive. If the owner repeatedly tries to get rid of it or leaves it behind at home, it torments him with terrible nightmares in which everyone he trusts abandons him. If the owner destroys the doll, he has disturbing nightmares in which people he trusts murder him in gruesome ways. If the owner keeps the doll in a backpack or other closed container for much of the day, he has nightmares in which he slowly suffocates in a dark, cramped place.</p>\n<p>The nightmares occur the next time the owner sleeps. This functions as per <em>nightmare </em>(DC 22); the doll is considered to have firsthand knowledge of the owner (or familiar knowledge if the owner has owned the doll for more than a week) and to have a body part. Regardless of how the owner abandons or destroys the doll, it returns the next night in the same condition as when the owner first found it. Using <em>break enchantment </em>or <em>remove curse </em>on the doll makes it unable to return for 1d4+1 days, though at that point, it returns as usual.</p>\n<p>The doll is quick to forgive, however. If the owner treats it well for a day, carrying it openly and maintaining physical contact, the nightmares fade away until the doll feels that it has been mistreated again. The only certain way to get rid of or destroy the doll (short of <em>miracle </em>or <em>wish</em>) is to find someone who accepts it as a gift. If the owner dies, the curse is lifted, and the doll patiently waits until a new owner finds it, though if the previous owner returns from the dead before that time, the doll returns to his side.</p>\n<h1>INTENDED MAGIC ITEM</h1>\n<p><em>anatomy doll </em>(<em>Ultimate Equipment </em>276), <em>ganji doll</em>(OA), <em>hexing doll</em></p>\n<p>^Horror Gear and Magic Items Bestiary</p>"}

Chapter 1: Horror Characters}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>A hunger for the flesh of the living grows more every day, until every sentient creature seems no more than a meal.</p>\n<h1>Catalyst</h1>\n<p>Ghoul corruption commonly stems from desperate cannibalism, such as surviving a near-death experience by eating friends who perished. You might contract ghoul corruption after recovering from ghoul fever (<em>Bestiary </em>146), especially if you died from the disease but were raised from the dead before rising as a ghoul.</p>\n<h2>Progression</h2>\n<p>Each week, you need to consume one portion of flesh from a sentient creature. A creature one size category smaller than you counts as one portion, a creature of your size category counts as four portions, and a creature one size larger counts as 16 portions. The extra meat from Huge or larger creatures spoils quickly enough that it can't all be consumed within a week. After a week, if you haven't consumed enough flesh, you must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 15 + your manifestation level) each day until you've eaten enough. If you fail the save, the next time you rest your corruption takes over and you unconsciously hunt and feed, devouring a living sentient creature completely. In this state, you can't differentiate between creatures and might consume an innocent; if you do so, your corruption progresses to the next stage.</p>\n<p>If circumstances make it impossible to feed (such as if you are tied down or in a locale with nothing to feed upon), you start to starve as if you had not eaten in 3 days (<em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook </em>445),</p>\n<p>and you continue to hunger for flesh and struggle to escape and feed until you have received five times the amount of flesh from sentient creatures you normally require. If your allies are able to restrain and feed you flesh from sentient creatures, your corruption doesn't progress. However, the DC of the Will save against your corruption progressing increases by 2. These increases stack each time this occurs, and they last until your corruption reaches the next corruption stage.</p>\n<p>In addition to starvation, close brushes with death also increase your craving for flesh. Whenever you are dropped below 0 hit points, you must attempt a single saving throw as if you hadn't eaten enough flesh that week.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 1</strong>: Once you feed on an innocent sentient creature-either willingly or because you failed a saving throw-your alignment shifts one step toward evil and spells that detect undead sense you, though the peculiar result they return informs the caster that you're still a living creature. Other spells and effects don't treat you as undead.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 2</strong>: The second time, your alignment shifts another step toward evil and you are affected by spells and abilities as if your creature type were undead (including effects like <em>bane </em>and the favored enemy class feature). This doesn't grant you any of the immunities of being undead, nor does it make you immune to effects that target living creatures or change how negative and positive energy affect you.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 3</strong>: The third time, you become an NPC ghoul under the GM's control.</p>\n<h2>Removing the Corruption</h2>\n<p>Getting rid of the ghoul corruption typically requires fasting, isolation from creatures that could incite your hunger, and atoning (as per <em>atonement</em>) for the acts that led to the corruption.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>MANIFESTATIONS</h1>\n<p>The following are manifestations of the ghoul corruption.</p>\n<h2>Brain Eater</h2>\n<p>Devouring brains imparts knowledge to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 5th, gnashing bite*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: If you eat the brain of a creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher, you gain a +2 insight bonus on all skill checks in which the creature possessed ranks for 1 hour. Eating a brain is a full-round action, and the target must be dead or helpless. If the target is alive, you can attempt to eat its brain as a coup de grace attack with your gnashing bite, but you gain the bonus only if your attempt results in the victim's death.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You take a -4 penalty on saves to resist ghoul corruption.</p>\n<h2>Corpse Armor</h2>\n<p>Your flesh is unnaturally tough.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain a +2 bonus to your natural armor. At manifestation level 5th, this bonus increases by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Your flesh's corpselike consistency deadens your sensations and makes it harder for you to move. You take a -2 penalty to your Dexterity score.</p>\n<h2>Diseased Bite</h2>\n<p>Your bite carries a terrible disease</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 4th, gnashing bite*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Creatures damaged by your bite attack must succeed at a Fortitude save or contract ghoul fever (<em>Bestiary </em>146). A humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at the next midnight, as described in the ghoul fever entry.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Your body has a difficult time fighting off diseases. You take a -4 penalty on Fortitude saves to resist diseases.</p>\n<h2>Gnashing Bite</h2>\n<p>Your jaw can unhinge and your teeth grow to sharp points.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain a bite attack as a primary natural weapon. This bite deals 1d6 points of damage if your size is Medium (1d4 if Small).</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Your tongue grows long and serpentine. You take a -2 penalty to your Charisma score.</p>\n<h2>Greater Paralysis</h2>\n<p>Your paralyzing touch is even stronger.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 7th, paralysis*, rending claws*, staggering claw*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: A creature that fails its save against your paralysis manifestation is paralyzed for 1d4 rounds instead of 1 round. Elves are immune to this effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Your connection to negative energy is so intense you recoil from its anathema. Whenever you take damage from a positive energy source, you are frightened for 1 round.</p>\n<h2>Greater Stench of the Grave</h2>\n<p>The smell surrounding you becomes overwhelming.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 6th, corpse armor*, stench of the grave*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Creatures that fail their saves against your stench of the grave manifestation become nauseated for 1 round before being sickened for 1d6 rounds. Once they have become nauseated in this way, they are immune to the nausea effect of your stench for 1 hour. A creature that succeeds at its save becomes immune to both your stench's nausea and sickened conditions for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Your stench is so great that it makes interacting with you almost impossible, as others retch and vomit just from being near you. Living creatures with a sense of smell refuse to engage with you at all, so you fail checks like Diplomacy and Handle Animal with living creatures before you can even attempt them.</p>\n<h2>Paralysis</h2>\n<p>A slash from your claws can render a creature helpless.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 6th, rending claws*, staggering claw*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: When you confirm a critical hit against a living creature, it must succeed at a Fortitude save or become paralyzed for 1 round. Elves are immune to this effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You are inured to negative energy. You are treated as an undead creature when subjected to channeled energy, <em>cure </em>spells, and <em>inflict </em>spells.</p>\n<h2>Rending Claws</h2>\n<p>You grow vicious claws, perfect for stripping flesh from bone.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain two claw attacks as primary natural weapons. These claws deal 1d4 points of damage if your size is Medium (or 1d3 if you're Small).</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You take a -2 penalty on attacks with manufactured weapons and on all ranged attacks.</p>\n<h2>Staggering Claw</h2>\n<p>Your touch weakens the muscles of your victims.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 4th, rending claws*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Once per day per manifestation level, you can make a staggering claw attack as a standard action. If you hit, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your manifestation level.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: The flesh on your hands is covered with pustules and blisters, and your hunger begins to devour your emotions. The penalty you take on ranged attacks and attacks with manufactured weapons increases to -4. Your spells with somatic or emotion (<em>Occult Adventures </em>144) components have a failure chance of 5%. This stacks with any spell failure chances you incur from other sources. (For example, if you were wearing leather armor and casting arcane spells, you would have a 15% spell failure chance.)</p>\n<h2>Stench of the Grave</h2>\n<p>Your body exudes a stench of decay.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Corpse armor*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You exude an aura of decay. Creatures that begin their turns adjacent to you are sickened for 1d6 rounds unless they succeed at a Fortitude save. A creature that succeeds can't be affected by your stench again for 24 hours. At manifestation level 5th, this aura extends out to 10 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: The stench of decay you emit allows creatures with scent to notice you from twice the usual distance, and makes it extremely difficult to disguise yourself. Any living creatures that have a sense of smell have their starting attitudes toward you reduced by one step. Your supernatural scent is not affected by the <em>negate aroma</em>(APG) spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: Upon taking this manifestation, you must take both the gift and the stain, even with the useful corruption or vile corruption variants (see page 14).</p>"}
{"_id":"OXl7SdYgzwN6ODeh","name":"2.04. Inquisitor","permission":{"default":0,"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR":3},"folder":"","flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_vh83dbmaz5j","path":"Horror Adventures#/CF_SEP/2. Chapter 2: Archetypes and Class Options","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<p>@Compendium[pf-content.horror-adventures.jsEW1pMN3Ds5FXmw]{(Index) Horror Adventures}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.horror-adventures.qet8A89j9mn1czfm]{2.0. Chapter 2: Archetypes And Class Options}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When true evil threatens the land, some inquisitors cling to the words of their deities in a direct fashion, using their gods' holy books as weapons. Others give in to the temptation to use their foes' magic against them, delving into witchcraft in order to combat the darkness that surrounds them and threatens to extinguish the light.</p>\n<h1>Hexenhammer (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Some inquisitors embrace the dark powers of their traditional foes, turning such powers toward their own ends in order to pronounce judgment on those who oppose them. These inquisitors learn to use the hexes and some spells of witches, but must pay the price for dealing with supernatural powers, as they slip ever closer to the evil they seek to destroy.</p>\n<p><strong>Withering Gaze (Su)</strong>: Hexenhammers study the effects of a witch's evil eye, and can use this dark magic to steel their gaze in a similar manner. Beginning at 1st level, whenever a hexenhammer successfully demoralizes a creature as a standard action, instead of applying the shaken condition, she can apply the effects of the witch evil eye(APG) hex as if she were a 1st-level witch (save DC = 10 + 1/2 the hexenhammer's inquisitor level + her Wisdom modifier).</p>\n<p>This ability replaces monster lore and stern gaze.</p>\n<p><strong>Pride and Penance (Ex)</strong>: Hexenhammers are deeply conflicted about their dealings with dark powers. If a hexenhammer uses a hex or casts a spell gained from the witch class spell list, she temporarily loses access to her domain abilities and her cunning mind bonus until she undergoes a brief period of penance and atonement that takes 1 minute of quiet prayer and contemplation; this atonement doesn't require any additional cost, and it automatically restores the lost abilities, regardless of how many times the hexenhammer uses her dark powers.</p>\n<p>If the hexenhammer uses her dark trade ability (see below) to trade uses of judgment for hexes, she loses access to her domain abilities and cunning mind bonus until the next time she regains her spell slots for the day.</p>\n<p>This ability alters domain.</p>\n<p><strong>Cunning Mind (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a hexenhammer gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against hexes, curses, spells of the necromancy school, and spells with the evil descriptor.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces cunning initiative.</p>\n<p><strong>Hexcrafter (Su)</strong>: Beginning at 3rd level, a hexenhammer learns to turn some powers of witches to her own advantage. She learns either the blight(APG), the misfortune(APG), or the slumber(APG) hex from the witch's hex list, and can use that hex once per day as a standard action, using her inquisitor level in place of a witch level. If the hex allows a saving throw, the save DC to resist the hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the inquisitor's level + the inquisitor's Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<p>At 6th level, 12th, and 15th levels, the hexenhammer learns an additional hex from her available hexes. At 9th level and 18th level, the hexenhammer can use any one of her hexes one additional time per day. At 12th level, the hexenhammer adds the agony(APG), nightmares(APG), and retribution(APG) major hexes to her list of learnable hexes.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces teamwork feats.</p>\n<p><strong>Dark Trade (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a hexenhammer can forgo the power of her judgments and succumb to the temptation of darker powers. She can trade a daily use of judgment to instead gain an additional use of one of her hexes.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces solo tactics.</p>\n<p><strong>Witchcraft (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level and at every 3 inquisitor levels thereafter, a hexenhammer can learn a witch spell in place of a spell she already knows. In effect, she loses an old spell in exchange for a new one selected from the witch class spell list. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level inquisitor spell she can cast. The hexenhammer can swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time she gains new spells known for the level.</p>\n<p>This ability alters the inquisitor's spellcasting.</p>\n<h1>Living Grimoire (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>The living grimoire literally wields the sacred word of his deity, using his holy tome to smite the foes of his god with divine might. Unlike most inquisitors, a living grimoire focuses on careful study of divine scripture, valuing knowledge over intuition.</p>\n<p><strong>Holy Book (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, a living grimoire forms a supernatural bond with a large ironbound tome containing the holy text of his deity and learns to use it as a weapon.</p>\n<p>When wielding the holy book as a weapon, he deals base damage as if it were a cold iron light mace (but see Sacred Word below), is considered proficient with the book, takes no improvised weapon penalty, and gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls with the book. The tome serves as his holy symbol and divine focus, and can be enchanted as a magic weapon.</p>\n<p>He can replace his bonded tome with another book at any time, though he must perform a 24-hour binding ritual to attune himself to the new book.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces monster lore.</p>\n<p><strong>Spells</strong>: A living grimoire must prepare his spells ahead of time, and can know any number of inquisitor spells. He uses Intelligence instead of Wisdom as his key spellcasting ability score (to determine his spell DCs, bonus spells per day, modifier on concentration checks, and so on), and to determine the effects and number of uses of his domain powers.</p>\n<p>The living grimoire receives the same number of spell slots per day as a warpriest of his inquisitor level, and receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Intelligence score. He must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time by choosing a time each day for 1 hour of quiet contemplation while he studies his holy book.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, the living grimoire's holy book contains all 0-level inquisitor spells plus three 1st-level inquisitor spells of his choice. He also selects a number of additional 1st-level inquisitor spells equal to his Intelligence modifier to add to his holy book. At each new inquisitor level, he gains two new inquisitor spells of any spell levels he can cast (based on his new inquisitor level) for his holy book. At any time, he can learn inquisitor spells from scrolls or other written sources and add inquisitor spells he finds to his holy book.</p>\n<p>This ability alters orisons and spellcasting and replaces cunning initiative.</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Word (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, a living grimoire learns to charge his holy book with the power of his faith. The inquisitor gains the benefits of the warpriest's sacred weapon(ACG) class ability, but the benefits apply only to his bonded holy book. Like a warpriest's sacred weapon, the living grimoire's book deals damage based on the inquisitor's level, not the book's base damage (unless the inquisitor chooses to use the book's base damage).</p>\n<p>At 4th level, the living grimoire gains the ability to enhance his holy book with divine power as a swift action. This ability grants the holy book a +1 enhancement bonus. For every 4 inquisitor levels the living grimoire has beyond 4th, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). These bonuses stack with any existing bonuses the holy book might have, to a maximum of +5. The living grimoire can enhance his holy book to have any of the special abilities listed in the warpriest's sacred weapon ability, subject to the same alignment restrictions, but adds <em>bane </em>to the general special ability list. Adding any of these special abilities to the holy book consumes an amount of enhancement bonus equal to the special ability's base price modifier. The holy book must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus before the living grimoire can add any special abilities to it. The living grimoire can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his inquisitor level, but these rounds don't need to be consecutive. As with the warpriest sacred weapon ability, he determines the enhancement bonus and special abilities the first time he uses the ability each day, and they cannot be changed until the next day.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces judgment.</p>\n<p><strong>Blessed Script (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, a living grimoire can permanently tattoo one spell of 2nd level or lower from his holy book onto his body. The tattooed spell cannot have an expensive material component or focus. The living grimoire can prepare any tattooed spell without needing his holy book, and can cast his tattooed spells as a spell-like ability once per day.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, the living grimoire can tattoo one additional spell of 3rd level or lower upon himself. At 12th level, he can tattoo one additional spell of 4th level or lower upon himself, and at 16th level he can tattoo a final additional spell of any level upon himself.</p>\n<p>When the living grimoire uses these spell-like abilities, the tattooed holy script associated with the spell-like ability glows as per <em>light </em>for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces bane, greater bane, second judgment, and third judgment.</p>\n<p><strong>Word of God (Su)</strong>: At 20th level, a living grimoire can smite his foes with the holy word of his deity. Up to seven times per day, the inquisitor can make a single melee attack with his holy book against a target. If the attack hits, it deals damage normally and the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or die (DC = 10 + 1/2 the living grimoire's inquisitor level + his Intelligence modifier). Regardless of whether the save is successful, the target creature is immune to the living grimoire's word of god ability for 24 hours.

Chapter 5: Horror Rules}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While the pain of physical torture and of a ghoul stripping flesh from the bones of its alive-but-paralyzed prey are horrible ends, few fates are as ghastly as the dire transformations made by the fleshwarper. Fleshwarping is the general term for two main magical and alchemical practices: \"true fleshwarping\" and fleshcrafting. It is also used to describe transformative mutations caused by exposure to polluted alchemy labs, magical radiation, or either cursed or corrupted magic, which are properly known as fleshwarp mutations.</p>\n<p>True fleshwarping is a vile and violent practice, both alchemical and magical, used to transform one creature into an entirely new form. It's a horrific art practiced by the drow and other depraved societies to create servants or to bind creatures into twisted forms as sadistic punishment.</p>\n<p>Fleshcrafting uses a similar process to physically modify the subject by mutating or replacing a body part with that of another creature. This gruesome discipline can also be used to create fleshcraft elixirs that grant creatures temporary versions of fleshcraft grafts.</p>\n<p>In addition to the intentional practices of true fleshwarping and fleshcrafting is a transformation called a fleshwarp mutation, which also involves the nightmarish metamorphosis of a creature into a new form. This type of fleshwarping, however, is a phenomenon rather than a willful act, and typically occurs after a creature interacts with a particularly strong magical or alchemical hazard. The more a creature is exposed to that hazard, the greater the effects of the fleshwarp mutation.</p>\n<h1>TRUE FLESHWARPING</h1>\n<p>Willfully transforming one creature into another through magical and alchemical processes is a terrifying technique performed by the most cruel and vicious of creatures. Power-hungry necromancers, heartless alchemists, demon worshipers, aboleths, and the drow are some of the best-known practitioners of this foul art, using dark knowledge and secret formulas to flay the creature's flesh and twist them into amalgamated forms.</p>\n<p>Some sages theorize that other amalgamated creatures, such as chimeras, owlbears, and maybe even skum and bulettes, could have also been the result of an archaic form of fleshwarping. Legends involving Lamashtu's creation of the chimera give a certain amount of credence to this theory, but even it's true, the secrets to these early fleshwarps are long lost.</p>\n<p>While fleshwarping often yields results useful to those depraved enough to carry it out, the act of creating a fleshwarp is always evil, as it requires unspeakable acts and horrific physiological and psychological torture inflicted upon the subject of the transformation. Unfortunately, this has not stopped the occasional alchemist or arcanist from pursuing fleshwarping for the well-meaning but ultimately deluded purposes of species genesis.</p>\n<p>Worse still, while the rare fleshwarp formula develops a truly unique race, this seems to be the exception rather than the rule. In the majority of cases, the process involves the utter corruption of sentient beings warped into lurching monstrosities that are both intellectually stunted and existentially compromised. As such, most fleshwarp creatures are sterile. The most famous fleshwarp mutation, the drider, is the chief exception to this rule. Still, the process of creating a drider is no blessing, but rather a cruel punishment perpetrated by the depraved dark elves upon their own kind. If possible, the processes drow inflict on other creatures are even crueler. This also points to another rule of fleshwarping: creatures that are inherently evil tend to take forms that are useful and powerful, while good creatures tend to metamorphose into more twisted and helpless forms. Another quirk of true fleshwarping is that targets of mixed race, such has half-elves and half-orcs, usually transform into creatures that more strongly reflect their non-human parentage. Lastly, while dwarves have proven strangely resilient to drow methods of fleshwarping, the methods of other races have successfully warped dwarves into new creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Fleshwarping Process</strong>: The creation of a true fleshwarp is partly magical and partly alchemical. While a team of alchemists, spellcasters, and torturers is often assembled to perform fleshwarping, it must be led by at least one creature that has the Fleshwarper feat (see page 87) and must be performed on a living creature or creatures. Any attempt to fleshwarp a corpse automatically fails.</p>\n<p>Before the process, a fleshwarper usually restrains the subject or subjects. She then must make precise cuts in a subject's flesh and insert tubes into those incisions. These tubes connect to vats of bubbling alchemical substances, which are pumped into the subject's body, racking it with agony. These fluids break down the subject's corporeal form, making it more malleable. Each subject undergoing the fleshwarping process must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or instantly die from this procedure. If the fleshwarper succeeds at a DC 20 Heal check during this process, she grants the subject a +2 bonus on this saving throw.</p>\n<p>Assuming a subject survives the fluid infusion, the fleshwarper then forces a breathing tube down the subject's throat. Unable to speak, the subject is at best able to make strangled noises as the fleshwarper immerses it into the alchemical concoction that completes its transformation. Once immersed in the alchemical compound, the subject's body goes through a rapid series of transformations. During this arduous process, attendants must periodically remove necrotic tissue and organs, as well as flesh that has sloughed off the creature's body.</p>\n<p>The entire fleshwarping process requires 1 day per Hit Die of the final fleshwarped creature. During this time, the fleshwarper must succeed at a Craft (alchemy) check with a DC equal to the creation DC of the fleshwarped creature (typically, 15 + the final fleshwarped creature's Hit Dice) each day. Creating a fleshwarped creature takes a number of days equal to 1 + the final fleshwarped creature's CR. The fleshwarper can't gain the benefit of aid another nor can she take 10 on these checks. Failure indicates each subject undergoing the fleshwarping process takes 1d3 points of Constitution damage, which can't be healed until the process is complete, and that day's work doesn't count toward the creation time. If a fleshwarping subject's Constitution damage (whether from this failure or the final Constitution damage at the conclusion) ever equals or exceeds its Constitution score, its body collapses into protoplasmic goo. Creatures slain in such a fashion can't be raised from the dead except by <em>true resurrection </em>or equally powerful magic, and if any of the component creatures breaks down in this way, the final fleshwarp fails.</p>\n<p>During the entire process, the subject is racked with the agony of the change. At the conclusion of the fleshwarping process, the final creation takes 2d6 points of Constitution damage. A successful DC 25 Heal check made by an attending participant can mitigate the suffering a subject undergoes, reducing the Constitution damage to 1d6 points.</p>\n<p>The alchemical components for fleshwarping are expensive, difficult to create, and expended after a single use. The ingredients for fleshwarping vary from one practitioner to the next, but often include corrosive fungi, poison from several breeds of giant insects, assorted pulverized oozes, essences from a chaos beast, protean spittle, and other exotic reagents. These reagents have a combined cost of 10,000 gp per subject to be fleshwarped in addition to other costs associated with specific fleshwarping procedures (see the Fleshwarped Creatures sidebar on page 167).</p>\n<h1>FLESHCRAFTING</h1>\n<p>Fleshcrafting involves the same processes and applications as true fleshwarping, but is used to modify only a single portion of a living creature. Fleshcrafts are living pieces of tissue that can be attached to any corporeal, living creature via a graft or grown by a consumed elixir. Once attached, a fleshcraft immediately begins functioning and grants its listed abilities to the grafted creature. While a fleshcraft is partially magical in genesis, it doesn't radiate magic or have a caster level, regardless of whether it has been grafted to the subject or supplied via an elixir.</p>\n<p><strong>Fleshcraft Grafts</strong>: Creating a fleshcraft graft requires the Fleshwarper feat and an alchemy lab worth at least 1,000 gp as well as 1 pound of living tissue per 1,000 gp value of the graft to be created. Creating a fleshcraft graft is like creating a magic item and requires 1 day of crafting time per 1,000 gp of the graft's value.</p>\n<p>Applying a fleshcraft graft to a target requires a 1-hour surgical procedure, during which time the subject must be either willing or helpless. At the end of the hour, the surgeon must attempt a Heal check against the graft's listed DC. Failure indicates the patient's body rejects the graft and the graft dies. Regardless of the surgery's success, the subject takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage and 1d4 points of Wisdom damage (or 1d8 points of sanity damage, if employing the sanity system on page 12). Although fleshcraft grafts are not magical, some occupy a magic item slot on the body, preventing that slot from being used for any magic item or other graft.</p>\n<p>A fleshcraft graft can be removed with another hour-long surgery and a successful Heal check against the original DC. On a failure, either the graft remains or the surgeon removes the graft, destroying it and killing the subject (surgeon's choice). Alternatively, the surgeon can remove the graft more delicately and use healing magic to save the subject, attempting a DC 15 Heal check and applying a <em>heal </em>or <em>regenerate </em>spell immediately afterward. Failing this Heal check always results in the destruction of both graft and subject. A successful surgery removes and destroys the graft. Regardless of the method used and the surgery's success, the subject takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage and 1d4 points of Wisdom damage (or 1d8 points of sanity damage, if using the sanity system).</p>\n<p><strong>Fleshcraft Elixirs</strong>: A creature with the Fleshwarper feat can also create fleshcraft elixirs. Doing so requires an alchemy lab worth at least 1,000 gp as well as 1 pound of living tissue per 1,000 gp value of the elixir, just like creating a graft, but the components are distilled into the elixir. Creating a fleshcraft elixir is like creating a magic item and requires 1 day of crafting time per 1,000 gp of the graft's value. These potionlike concoctions can bestow the effect of an individual fleshcraft graft (a creature can't benefit from more than one at a time), but for a limited period of time. Imbibing a fleshcraft elixir works similarly to imbibing other potions or elixirs, except that it's slow acting, taking effect the round after it is imbibed (as if the imbiber were casting a 1-round casting time spell). Fleshcraft elixirs are foul and potentially dangerous. A fleshcraft elixir is keyed to a specific type of fleshcraft, and each elixir provides a Fortitude save that the imbiber must succeed at in order to gain that graft's effect for the limited duration. On a failed saving throw, the imbiber gains only the graft's penalty for its duration, and if the imbiber fails the saving throw by 5 or more, the imbiber also takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage. While not strictly magical (and not applicable for reuse with <em>alchemical allocation(</em>APG<em>)</em>, they count as both transmutation and poison effects that affect only living creatures for the purposes of saving throws and resistances.</p>\n<h1>Sample Fleshcrafts</h1>\n<p>Below are some examples of fleshcrafts. In addition to the name, slot, and effect, each fleshcraft presents information for both the elixir and the graft versions. Each category of information is explained below.</p>\n<p><strong>Temporary Duration</strong>: This is the length of time the fleshcraft lasts if the recipient is merely imbibing a fleshcraft elixir for its limited effects. This does not apply to a permanent fleshcraft such as a graft. If the graft has a limited number of uses per day, a creature affected by its corresponding elixir can use the ability the same number of times during the elixir's duration.</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong>: This is the DC of the Fortitude saving throw the imbiber must succeed at to gain the benefits rather than just the penalties of the fleshcraft when imbibing a fleshcraft elixir. A creature imbibing a corresponding elixir that fails this saving throw by 5 or more also takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Penalty</strong>: This is the penalty that a creature takes while benefiting from a fleshcraft graft or elixir, or takes if it fails the saving throw after imbibing a fleshcraft elixir.</p>\n<h1>ANTENNAE</h1>\n<p><strong>PRICE</strong> 70,000 GP</p>\n<p><strong>SLOT</strong> eyes <strong>ELIXIR</strong> <strong>PRICE</strong> 1,250 GP</p>\n<p><strong>TEMPORARY DURATION</strong> 10 minutes <strong>SAVING THROW DC</strong> 20</p>\n<p>The subject's eyes are replaced by antennae that sprout from its eye sockets.

On occasion, creatures are exposed to environmental hazards that replicate the adverse results of fleshwarping with less grace and precision than the alchemical and magical process of true fleshwarping. Areas of intense magical radiation, alchemical pollution, wild magic, and corrupted ley lines all might cause spontaneous fleshwarp mutations, and in the presence of supremely alien creatures such as the Great Old Ones (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 </em>135), the laws of reality can break down and sometimes create a similar effect, resulting in severe mutation and disfigurement.</p>\n<p>Fleshwarp mutations come at an even higher cost to the target's health, sanity, and life span than intentional fleshwarping. Fleshwarp mutations become more severe with greater exposure.</p>\n<p>Early mutations are typically cosmetic and act as a sign of something unnatural. Advanced fleshwarp mutations are always detrimental, causing physical and mental trauma to the creature.</p>\n<p>Fleshwarp mutations progress similarly to corruptions (see page 14), so at the GM's discretion, spells or effects that help against corruptions might also apply to them.</p>\n<p><strong>Acquiring Fleshwarp Mutations</strong>: Any long-term magical hazard can potentially carry the risk of fleshwarp mutation. Exposure to polluted alchemical labs, vile curses, bizarre rituals, wild magic zones, and cursed magic items are all good examples of fleshwarp mutations sources. A source of fleshwarp mutation is a hazard and is assigned a corresponding CR that reflects its relative severity.</p>\n<p>For every hour a living creature is exposed to a fleshwarp mutation source, that creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 15 + the CR of the corruptive source). Success means the creature has fought off the fleshwarping effects for the time being. On the first failed save, the exposed creature immediate gains an early fleshwarp mutation (see Table 5-1) and takes 1d3 points of Wisdom damage (or 1d6 points of sanity damage, if using the sanity system on page 12) due to the sudden and horrific nature of the metamorphosis. The second failed saving throw while the creature is within the same area increases the severity of the mutation. The creature gains an advanced mutation (see Table 5-2), and takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage (or 2d4 points of sanity damage). Once a creature has at least one advanced mutation, further exposure within the same area causes another advanced mutation on a failed save. However, this level of physical deformity is extremely taxing on a mutated creature, and each subsequent new mutation imposes a cumulative -2 penalty to the creature's Constitution score as long as the fleshwarped creature has the mutation. If the total penalties from mutations are greater than or equal to a character's normal Constitution score, its body can't support all the conflicting mutations, and it either dies or spontaneously warps into a mad, horrific creature.</p>\n<p>Fleshwarp mutation effects are transmutation effects, and may also be poison effects based on the nature of the corruption causing the mutations. All mutations are extraordinary abilities. Fleshwarp mutations can be healed with curative magic. <em>Lesser restoration</em>, <em>restoration</em>, or greater healing magic can remove all early fleshwarp mutations. <em>Greater restoration</em>, <em>heal</em>, or <em>restoration </em>can remove all advanced fleshwarp mutations.</p>\n<h1>Table 5-1: Early Fleshwarp Mutations</h1>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><strong>d%</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"12\"><strong>Mutation</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">1-4</td>\n<td colspan=\"12\">Animal Traits: Fur or scales grow all over the creature's body.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">5-8</td>\n<td colspan=\"12\">Bloated Neck: The creature's neck becomes inflated and toadlike.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">9-12</td>\n<td colspan=\"12\">Bone Protrusions: Bony protrusions grow across the creature's body.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">13-16</td>\n<td colspan=\"12\">Bulbous Cranium: Misshapen lumps and nodules cover the creature's head.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">17-20</td>\n<td colspan=\"12\">Elongated Tongue: The creature's tongue elongates and cannot fit inside its mouth properly.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">21-24</td>\n<td colspan=\"12\">Eye Stalks: The creature's eyes protrude from their sockets on short stalks.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">25-28</td>\n<td colspan=\"12\">Forked Tongue: The creature's tongue becomes forked like a snake's.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">29-32</td>\n<td colspan=\"12\">Gnarled: The creature's flesh takes on knotty, whorled patterns all over the body.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">33-36</td>\n<td colspan=\"12\">Hair Loss: Hair falls out in clumpy patches across the creature's body.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">37-40</td>\n<td colspan=\"12\">Huge Ears: The creature's ears become large and floppy, like those of an elephant.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">41-44</td>\n<td colspan=\"12\">Lidless Eyes: The creature's eyes become saucerlike and lidless.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">45-48</td>\n<td colspan=\"12\">Lipless Mouth: The creature's mouth becomes lipless, with exposed teeth and gums.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">49-52</td>\n<td colspan=\"12\">Long Fingers: The creature's digits elongate and gain additional joints.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">53-56</td>\n<td colspan=\"12\">Lurching: The creature grows a few inches taller, becomes gaunter, and walks with a lurching and ponderous gait.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">57-60</td>\n<td colspan=\"12\">Molten Flesh: The creature's skin sags, appearing to run like a melted candle.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">61-64</td>\n<td colspan=\"12\">Noseless: The creature's nose rots away, exposing its sinus cavity.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">65-68</td>\n<td colspan=\"12\">Pallid: The creature's flesh becomes translucent, revealing the veins and muscle beneath.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">69-72</td>\n<td colspan=\"12\">Ridges: Prominent ridged protrusions grow on the creature's forehead.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">73-76</td>\n<td colspan=\"12\">Sores: Painful blisters and sores erupt all over the creature's body.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">77-80</td>\n<td colspan=\"12\">Tumors: Tumorous growths appear across the creature's body.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">81-84</td>\n<td colspan=\"12\">Unnatural Eyes: The creature's pupils become unnaturally shaped or colored.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">85-88</td>\n<td colspan=\"12\">Vertical Eyelids: The creature's eyelids now form vertical slits that open and close from side to side.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">89-92</td>\n<td colspan=\"12\">Vestigial Digits: Additional vestigial digits grow from the creature's hands and feet.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">93-96</td>\n<td colspan=\"12\">Webbing: Webbing grows between the creature's fingers and toes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">97-100</td>\n<td colspan=\"12\">Wide Eyes: The creature's eyes subtly migrate toward the sides of its head.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-tables.OV0yaCFuNYD7SZN9]{Horror Adventures: Early Fleshwarp Mutations}</p>\n<h1>Table 5-2: Advanced Fleshwarp Mutations</h1>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>d%</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Mutation</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1-5</td>\n<td>Bioluminescent: The creature's flesh sheds an eerie light, the strength of a candle's.

Chapter 5: Horror Rules}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Curses are among the oldest and most deeply feared types of magic. They linger far beyond the original malicious words or grave deeds that spawned them. Although the most well-known and easily broken types of curses are spells, others are afflictions, from the notorious curse of lycanthropy to foul mummy rot and the esoteric death curse of the linnorm. All the new curses presented in this section are afflictions and share certain features as a result (<em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook </em>555).</p>\n<p>This section includes new curses, as well as several curse variants. It also provides advice for using all kinds of curses in your game, including guidelines on creating them.</p>\n<h1>CURSES IN YOUR GAME</h1>\n<p>Curses can afflict characters in a variety of ways, but because they are perniciously difficult to remove, the tone of the game can shift if they appear often. Most curses-especially those that require more than a simple <em>remove curse </em>spell to eliminate-should be used to add a significant and memorable challenge or as a consequence for a momentous choice. A relentless torrent of curses reduces their mystique while dramatically hampering a party's effectiveness, potentially removing the PCs' ability to deal with encounters of appropriate Challenge Ratings.</p>\n<h1>CURSE SPELLS</h1>\n<p>Many spells can place curses on unfortunate victims. Their effects are usually simple and can be ended with the right spell (but never <em>dispel magic</em>). All curse spells have the curse descriptor (<em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic </em>137). The most well-known is <em>bestow curse </em>(<em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook </em>247), which allows the caster to invent her own effect in line with the listed options (no worse than a 50% chance of losing actions, a -4 penalty on checks, or a -6 penalty to an ability score). Effects in line with that power level include the following, though ultimately they are limited only by the caster's imagination and the GM's discretion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When the victim is adjacent to the area of a damaging spell or spell-like effect (even one he created himself ), the area expands to include the victim.</li>\n<li>The victim can't heal naturally, and magical healing heals the victim by only half the usual amount (minimum 1 point). The victim's fast healing and regeneration, if any, are likewise halved.</li>\n<li>The victim is plagued by cacophonous sounds and strobing lights that only she can hear and see. She is distracted (-5 penalty on Perception checks), cannot take 10 on skill checks, and must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + spell level) to successfully cast spells. Any time the victim picks up or retrieves an object (including drawing a weapon or ammunition), there is a 50% chance that she immediately drops it. If she drops ammunition while attempting to make a ranged attack, that particular attack is lost.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Save DCs</strong>: The stat block for a curse lists the save DC. For curses that can be created by a spell, this usually represents the minimum DC. If a spell is used to create a curse in your game, calculate the DC using the caster's ability score and the spell level as normal.</p>\n<h1>NEW CURSES</h1>\n<p>The curses below supplement those presented in the <em>Core Rulebook </em>(pages 556-557).</p>\n<h1>BLASTED VITALITY</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>curse; <strong>Save </strong>Fortitude DC 19</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The victim's mind and body become unreliable, imposing a -4 penalty on all ability scores. Whenever the victim enters combat, he must succeed at a Fortitude save against the curse's DC or become fatigued.</p>\n<h1>HAUNTING, MAJOR</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>curse; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 17</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The victim is haunted by a ghost (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </em>144) as described in minor haunting (see below).</p>\n<p><strong>Cure </strong>Unlike a minor haunting, a major haunting can be ended only by putting the ghost to rest, though casting <em>remove curse </em>directly after the ghost is destroyed prevents it from reviving for 2d4 days.</p>\n<h1>HAUNTING, MINOR</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>curse; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 13</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The victim is haunted by a poltergeist (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 </em>211). Once per day, the victim must attempt a Will save against the curse. If she succeeds, she takes a cumulative -1 penalty on future saving throws against the curse. If she fails, the poltergeist manifests within 300 feet and begins stalking her over the course of 2d12 hours, attempting to kill her when she appears to be most vulnerable. When combat begins, the victim automatically becomes shaken for 1 minute. The curse revives the destroyed poltergeist to haunt the victim again the next time she fails the saving throw against this curse.</p>\n<p><strong>Cure </strong>In addition to the normal means for removing a curse, this one can be ended by determining the poltergeist's reason for existence and setting right whatever prevents it from resting in peace.</p>\n<h1>HUNT OF THE ANKOU</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>curse; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 22</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The victim is hunted by an ankou (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 </em>10) as described in hunt of the bogeyman (see page 139).</p>\n<p><strong>Cure </strong>Only a <em>miracle </em>or <em>wish </em>can free the victim.</p>\n<h1>HUNT OF THE BOGEYMAN</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>curse; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 19</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The victim is hunted by a bogeyman (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 </em>42). Once per day, the victim must attempt a Will save against the curse. If he succeeds, he takes a cumulative -1 penalty on future saving throws against the curse. If he fails, a bogeyman is called within 1 mile and begins stalking him over the course of 2d12 hours, attempting to kill him when he appears to be most vulnerable. When combat begins with the bogeyman, the victim automatically becomes shaken for 1 minute. The curse revives the slain bogeyman to hunt the victim again the next time he fails the saving throw against this curse.</p>\n<p><strong>Cure </strong>Only a <em>limited wish</em>, <em>miracle</em>, or <em>wish </em>can free the hunted.</p>\n<h1>SEALED FATE</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>curse; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 23 negates, Fortitude DC 23 partial</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The target is doomed to die in an appointed fashion (this curse can also be an unintended consequence of an attempt to prevent the target's death by other means). The victim gains a +4 luck bonus on Constitution checks to stabilize when dying as long as she is not suffering from injuries tied to the named cause of death. Whenever the target is damaged by the named cause of death, fails a save against that cause of death, or otherwise fails to withstand the named cause of death in a way that doesn't involve damage or saving throws (for instance, failing a Constitution check against suffocation), she must attempt a Fortitude save against this curse. If she fails, she dies instantly; if she succeeds, she is staggered for 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Cure </strong>Sealed fate can be removed only by <em>miracle </em>or <em>wish</em>.</p>\n<h1>SHATTERED SELF</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>curse; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 20 negates</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency </strong>no more than 1/day (see text)</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The victim's mind splits into two coexisting personas, one normal, the other malicious and self-destructive. When in control, the self-destructive persona sabotages the victim's efforts and plots the demise of the victim's friends and loved ones. It takes care to conceal its actions and intent from others. The normal persona has no sense of missing time. Exactly when the alternate persona takes control is up to the GM, but it does so no more than once per day. Each time the alternate persona surfaces, the victim must succeed at a save or the alternate persona takes control for 1d6 minutes. Normally these takeovers happen when the victim is alone or with just one person, but moments of extreme stress can force the victim to attempt a save against this effect as well. The alternate persona has full access to the normal persona's memories and abilities, and it receives a +10 bonus on Bluff checks to conceal its presence. Despite the malevolent nature of this affliction, the victim's alignment remains unchanged when under the curse's effects, so for instance, the self-destructive persona could still use a paladin victim's abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Cure </strong>Shattered self can be cured only by successfully casting <em>remove curse </em>and either <em>heal</em>, <em>greater restoration</em>, or <em>psychic surgery</em>(OA) on the victim within 1 minute of each other.</p>\n<h1>TORMENTING VISIONS</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>curse; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 15 negates</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The target is haunted by horrible phantasmal visions that distract him at critical moments. He takes a -4 penalty on concentration checks and on saving throws against effects that would impose any of the following conditions on him: confused, dazed, nauseated, shaken, sickened, or stunned. Once per day, when alone or confronted by something novel and strange, he must succeed at a Will save or take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage (or 1d6 points of sanity damage if using the sanity system on page 12).</p>\n<p><strong>Cure </strong>The tormenting visions curse can be removed only by <em>remove curse </em>followed by <em>banishment</em>, each cast within 1 minute of each another.</p>\n<h1>WEEPING WOUND</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>curse; <strong>Save </strong>Fortitude DC 14 negates</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The victim has a wound that cannot heal, effectively reducing her maximum hit points by an amount equal to her level or 5, whichever is more. Magical healing that would raise a victim's hit points above this reduced maximum is wasted.</p>\n<h1>Optional Rule: Spontaneous Curses</h1>\n<p>Although spellcasters can curse targets more easily than others, in times of great emotion and the need for vengeance, other creatures can channel divine or arcane energy to create a spontaneous curse. A curse can be improvised only under great stress, whether by the deepest indignity, seething hatred, cold revenge, or as a dying act (all at the GM's discretion), though in any case, never more than once in a month. Spontaneous curses are most commonly placed upon those who violate a taboo or a sacred or unholy place. Sometimes gods or other supernatural beings curse mortals who fail tests of character or who trespass where they are not welcome.</p>\n<p>If the GM allows a creature to place a spontaneous curse, that creature must have at least 5 ranks in Knowledge (arcana) or (religion). Such a creature can attempt to use a curse with a listed DC less than or equal to 10 + its number of ranks in the skill. Creatures with a curse ability, as well as some creatures closely associated with curses (such as angels, fey, hags, and undead), can curse a target without meeting this requirement. Improvising a curse reduces the cursing creature's Charisma score by 2, and this decrease remains as long as the curse lasts; the cursing creature cannot dismiss its improvised curse.</p>\n<h1>CREATING NEW CURSES</h1>\n<p>Curses needn't be limited to the effects described above or in the rules for afflictions (<em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook </em>555). When designing a new curse, though, be careful not to go too far. A devastating curse can have consequences as serious as dying or being turned to stone. Certainly, horrific curses that promise immediate and inescapable doom have their place, but curses that can be endured for a time bring far more horror to the table, as struggling under the curse can lead to more tension than instant death would bring, while surviving and escaping such a curse can become an adventure all its own. Consider these guidelines when creating a curse.</p>\n<p><strong>Make It Logical</strong>: A character generally doesn't get cursed for minding her own business. More often, the victim meddled with powerful forces, disturbed an ancient grave, or even wronged a vengeful fortune-teller. Try to fit the curse to the act that brought it on, like a glutton being unable to eat, a bigot becoming the target of his bigotry, or a tomb robber burning in the light of day.</p>\n<p><strong>Make It Interesting</strong>: A boring curse isn't worth the game time it consumes. A good curse should be creepy, comical, embarrassing, or terrifying, and it helps to have a good story behind it.</p>\n<p><strong>Make It Interactive</strong>: Some curses require the players and GM to roleplay effects such as an inability to lie or a compulsion to steal. This sort of curse can be very rewarding with a motivated group, as possible effects could extend far beyond what game mechanics decree.</p>\n<p><strong>Make It Simple</strong>: A good curse has easy-to-handle mechanics. Most curses should have only one or two effects, and should be possible to resolve during play. Avoid the need to reference complicated effects during combat. Failing that, prepare an index card with the curse's details that you can use as an easy reference.</p>\n<h1>Types of Curses</h1>\n<p>Curses can have a wide range of effects, which is something to keep in mind when designing a new curse. They may trigger only intermittently, apply a constant penalty, or grow worse with time. In addition, curses can function exclusively using game mechanics, or incorporate roleplaying considerations.</p>\n<p><strong>Intermittent</strong>: Some curses, such as unluck, trigger only under certain conditions but otherwise stay consistent in their effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanical</strong>: These curses rely on game mechanics for the majority of their effects, such as applying penalties, ability damage, or negative conditions. This sort of curse is a good choice if you want a steady, consistent effect for the curse, though particularly with conditions, you might have to start considering interactions with other abilities triggered by those conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>Progressive</strong>: A progressive curse functions much like a disease, requiring periodic checks to determine whether the affliction progresses. However, unlike those suffering from diseases, the victims of these curses cannot recover just by succeeding at saving throws. A progressive curse worsens with each failed save, often ending in incapacitation or death. Mummy rot is a typical progressive curse.</p>\n<p><strong>Static</strong>: Curses like <em>baleful polymorph </em>apply an effect for the entire duration of the curse, with no change in their severity.</p>\n<h1>Breaking the Curse</h1>\n<p>The most conventional way to rid a victim of a curse is the spell <em>remove curse</em>, occasionally with the aid of other or more powerful magic. When making a new curse, especially one with a strong story background, consider novel ways to remove the curse beyond just casting a spell, as with the spell <em>conditional curse</em>(UI). Robbers might be cursed until they return every ill-gotten coin, while a haughty aristocrat might suffer until she cleans the feet of a dozen beggars. In these cases, it's best to make the victim vaguely aware of how to end his torment, but let him discover the specific details on his own through either research or trial and error. Curses with story-based remedies are often hard to break with <em>remove curse </em>and <em>break enchantment. </em>Increase the DC for removal by 2, 5, or even 10 based on the power of the curse. Particularly powerful curses resist <em>remove curse </em>and <em>break enchantment </em>entirely, requiring either specific conditions for removal or the application of <em>limited wish</em>, <em>miracle</em>, or <em>wish</em>.</p>\n<p>Some curses are easier to remove than normal; improvised curses, because of their impromptu nature, tend to be easier to remove. A simple cleansing ritual might suffice to remove them, which the PCs could discover through exploration, research, or a successful Knowledge (religion) check. Such curses could even fade over the course of days or weeks. While many NPC casters offer curse removal with no questions asked, it is common knowledge that curses are rarely picked up accidentally. Some of these casters might want to know the circumstances behind the curse (often employing Sense Motive or even divination magic during the discussion). Good-aligned churches might expect acts of atonement or charity as at least partial payment for removing a justly gained curse.</p>\n<h1>Alternative Means of Relief</h1>\n<p>Should a curse seem impossible to end by either normal or conditional means, the accursed might take desperate measures for even temporary relief from their suffering. Many such methods are dire enough that creatures may consider them worse than simply being cursed.</p>\n<p><strong>Death</strong>: Some curses end upon the death of the victim, perhaps leading a victim to take her own life in the hope of being raised from the dead free of the curse. Although some find release this way, others are sorely disappointed; some gods may not smile upon such wanton suicide-or the victims might be restored to life, only to find themselves still afflicted by the curse.</p>\n<p><strong>Making Amends</strong>: A curse laid as punishment for a misdeed might be neutralized by rectifying the misdeed. But there are no guarantees. Undoing the misdeed and additionally offering a comparable effort to make up for the trouble caused might allow a new saving throw against the curse to remove it. Forgiveness from the curse-layer grants a +4 bonus on this saving throw. For curses that require amends, <em>remove curse </em>generally fails unless and until such amends are made.</p>\n<p><strong>Symbiosis</strong>: On rare occasions, a character might allow the curse to infect her very being as a desperate attempt to mitigate the effects, hoping that this will give her some measure of control. Symbiosis with a curse is rarely successful, and it usually leads to contracting an accursed corruption (see page 16), as the curse takes over the creature's personality. In rare cases, curse symbiosis might transform the accursed into a monster associated with curses (such as a hag) without first going through an accursed corruption.</p>\n<h1>CURSED ITEMS</h1>\n<p>The <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook </em>and <em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment </em>describe many kinds of cursed magic items. These cursed items most commonly result from something going horribly wrong during the creation of a normal magic item. However, it is also possible for such items to carry a curse to punish a death or to be the result of intentional malice. Cursed items are often most pernicious and difficult to thwart when created to hurt a particular foe.</p>\n<h1>Crafting Cursed Items</h1>\n<p>A creature can intentionally craft a cursed item-except unique cursed items and items with opposite effects-in the same manner as the item it resembles in most respects. Crafting a cursed item has the same requirements and calls for the same skill checks as for the normal item, but in addition, intentionally cursed items require <em>bestow curse </em>or <em>major curse</em>(UM). Crafting cursed items that pervert normal items usually has the same cost as for the fully functional versions, though with the exceptions below. However, as with all magic item price guidelines, the discounts below should be used only as a starting point for determining a cursed item's final price, and the particulars of a given situation will likely require ad hoc adjustments beyond the advice below.</p>\n<p><strong>Delusion</strong>: Items that merely delude the user into thinking they function cost 90% less than normal, or possibly even less (for instance, an item that deludes the user into thinking it's a <em>mirror of life trapping </em>probably doesn't need to cost 20,000 gp).</p>\n<p><strong>Drawbacks and Requirements</strong>: Drawbacks and requirements typically don't reduce the cost of a cursed item in any way (and might increase it). Since the crafter of an intentionally cursed item is setting these requirements, it is expected that she does so with a particular agenda, such as choosing a requirement that doesn't affect her very much but would make the item painful for her enemies to use should they steal it, or choosing a requirement that she wants someone to perform anyway and then offering the item as a gift.</p>\n<p>That said, these curses typically affect the price when selling the cursed items to a merchant. The price may be reduced by 10% for minor drawbacks or requirements such as minimum skill ranks or the worship of a specific deity; by 30% for harmful or costly drawbacks or requirements such as an alignment change, ability damage, sacrificing wealth, or performing a quest to activate the item; or by 50% for severe drawbacks or requirements such as negative levels that cannot be removed or needing to routinely sacrifice sentient creatures to the item.</p>\n<p><strong>Opposite Effect on Target</strong>: These items are rarely appropriate for a character to intentionally craft, as they might lead to weird situations where a reverse attack or a dispelling of certain spells is actually beneficial when used on allies, or vice versa. For effects where the opposite is not a new effect (such as <em>inflict light wounds </em>instead of <em>cure light wounds</em>), the crafter might as well just craft the opposite item to begin with unless she plans on tricking the owner of the item.</p>\n<p><strong>Stained Items</strong>: A creature's death can potentially stain a magic item that's used to kill it, that's in close proximity at the moment of death, or that's crafted using material gained by its death. A stained item is permanently converted into a cursed item of the appropriate type. A stained item functions as normal for a cursed item of its type except that the DCs of checks for <em>remove curse </em>or similar magic to suppress or remove the item's curse from any creature responsible for the curse-layer's death increases by 5.</p>\n<p><strong>Unique Items</strong>: These items should be priced and their crafting requirements assigned on a case-by-case basis as new items with the effects they produce rather than the items they appear to be.</p>\n<h1>Unique Cursed Items</h1>\n<p>These are two examples of unique cursed items.</p>\n<h1>SCROLL OF BLOOD INK</h1>\n<p><strong>SLOT</strong> none <strong>CL</strong> varies <strong>WEIGHT</strong> -</p>\n<p><strong>AURA</strong> varies</p>\n<p>This scroll can seem to contain any spell. When the wielder attempts to cast the spell, the ink turns to blood and runs off the page, ruining the spell automatically. The scroll's edges turn sharp and cut the wielder's hands and wrists, dealing 4 points of Constitution bleed. A successful DC 15 Reflex save halves the bleed. The bleed can be stopped with any magical healing or a successful DC 20 Heal check.</p>\n<h1>INTENDED MAGIC ITEM</h1>\n<p>any scroll</p>\n<h1>STAFF OF MAGICAL DECLINE</h1>\n<p><strong>SLOT</strong> none <strong>CL</strong> varies <strong>WEIGHT</strong> 5 lbs.</p>\n<p><strong>AURA</strong> varies</p>\n<p>This staff appears to be an ordinary staff and functions normally as such until it is used in combat. The wielder's effective caster level drops to match that of the staff or the wielder's caster level - 4, whichever is lower. The wielder's spellcasting ability score drops to 10 + staff's highest spell level, unless it is already lower.</p>\n<p>The wielder must employ the staff rather than any other melee weapon or spell trigger item. Even if the staff is fully charged, the caster fails to regain spell slots for the day unless she forgoes a spell slot to restore 1 charge to the staff. However, she never again regains a spell slot used to charge the staff until she is freed from the curse. The only way for the wielder to be rid of the staff is by <em>miracle </em>or <em>wish</em>.</p>\n<h1>INTENDED MAGIC ITEM</h1>\n<p>Any staff</p>\n<h1>CURSED LAND</h1>\n<p>Cursed land is a region marked by divine judgment, scarred by a great tragedy, or wounded by intentional malice. Common causes of such a regional curse include undead hauntings in the area, a grave transgression by the inhabitants that offends a powerful spirit or god, and large-scale killing or destruction that demands justice. They can also be artificially created with spells, such as <em>curse of night</em>, <em>curse of fell seasons</em>, and the <em>curse terrain </em>spells (see page 114). A regional curse has an area in addition to the features all curses have. All regional curses have a DC for the purpose of removing the curse, but many of their effects allow no saving throw. When casting <em>remove curse </em>to remove a regional curse, the caster treats the land as an object and typically needs to be at the center of the emanation or at some other location closely tied to the curse.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, a creature's punishment curse and a land's curse are the same. A cursed lord (see page 235) is a creature trapped by a cursed realm. The cursed lord gains power over the realm, but is incapable of leaving unless the curse is somehow broken, which usually involves killing or redeeming the cursed lord. Characters can accomplish this only by enacting very specific circumstances, similar to the restrictions placed upon the destruction of artifacts. For example, a cursed realm might trap a villainous cursed lord who profited by selling false maps to escaped slaves and refugees, who then drowned while attempting to cross a river at a nonexistent ford; the realm would be impossible to free from the stain of his heinous crime until he is slain and his body is placed in the river by a former slave.</p>\n<h1>CURSED EARTH</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>regional curse; <strong>Area </strong>1-mile-radius emanation; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 23 to remove (see spell text)</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The area is cursed with famine, living death, or plague, as described in <em>cursed earth </em>(<em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic </em>215).</p>\n<h1>ENDLESS NIGHT</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>regional curse; <strong>Area </strong>1-mile-radius emanation; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 22 negates</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>Nonmagical light and magical light sources that produce normal light create only dim light in the cursed area, and even direct sunlight leads to only an ambient dim light in the area (similar to a full moon). Twilight and night are always dark. Creatures harmed or weakened by daylight can move about during the day in this area and the only impairment they take from the dimmed sunlight is that they become dazzled in its area. Plant growth in the area is stunted, as per the stunt growth usage of <em>diminish plants</em>. Any spellcaster attempting to cast <em>daylight </em>or a spell that creates true daylight or bright light in the area fails unless she succeeds at a Will saving throw against the curse. Success leads to normal light, rather than bright light.</p>\n<p><strong>Cure </strong>An endless night can be lifted only by successfully casting <em>remove curse </em>followed by <em>sunburst </em>at noon on a clear day.</p>\n<h1>JEALOUS STRUCTURE</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>regional curse; <strong>Area </strong>1 structure; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 19 negates effects</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>A building can take on a life of its own if enough memories, fears, or other strong emotions become bound up in it. Such a building seeks to force residents to stay and either keep it company, serve it, protect it, or feed its unearthly hungers. The jealous structure is similar to a building-sized intelligent magic item of any evil alignment with Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of 16, fast healing 5, and the ability to use the following spell-like abilities at caster level 11th a minimum of the number of times per day listed below: 3/day-<em>animate objects </em>(furniture only), heightened <em>fear </em>(DC 19), heightened <em>telekinesis </em>(unattended objects only; DC 19); 1/day-<em>guards and wards</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Cure </strong>A jealous structure can be put to rest only by a casting of <em>remove curse </em>followed by a casting of <em>hallow </em>over the entire structure.</p>\n<h1>PERILOUS DEMESNE, GRAND</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>regional curse; <strong>Area </strong>18-mile-radius emanation; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 22 to remove</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>As per major perilous demesne (see page 145), except up to seven hazards, each of CR 14 or less, imperil creatures in the area. The hazards are arranged so that if any are encountered together, the encounter's effective CR from hazards must be no more than 15 (for instance, two CR 13 hazards could be encountered together).</p>\n<p><strong>Cure </strong><em>Remove curse </em>removes a grand perilous demesne only if followed by a casting of <em>hallow </em>at the effect's center, and then casting <em>disintegrate </em>on each of the hazards before the next nightfall or midnight.</p>\n<h1>PERILOUS DEMESNE, GREATER</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>regional curse; <strong>Area </strong>6-mile-radius emanation; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 19 to remove</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>As per major perilous demesne (see below), except up to six hazards, each of CR 10 or less, imperil creatures in the area. The hazards are arranged so that if any are encountered together, the encounter's effective CR from hazards must be no more than 11 (for instance, two CR 9 hazards could be encountered together).</p>\n<p><strong>Cure </strong><em>Remove curse </em>removes a greater perilous demesne only if followed by a casting of <em>hallow </em>at the effect's center.</p>\n<h1>PERILOUS DEMESNE, MAJOR</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>regional curse; <strong>Area </strong>1-mile-radius emanation; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 16 to remove</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>As per minor perilous demesne (see below), except this can involve up to four hazards, each of CR 6 or less, imperil creatures in the area. If any hazards are encountered together, the encounter's effective CR from hazards must be no more than 7 (for instance, two CR 5 hazards could be encountered together).</p>\n<h1>PERILOUS DEMESNE, MINOR</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>regional curse; <strong>Area </strong>300-foot-radius emanation; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 13 to remove</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>Up to three hazards (see the Environments section on page 152), each of CR 3 or less, imperil creatures in the area, though never with more than one hazard at a time. If a creature places this curse, it can choose the hazards. The hazards must be appropriate to the type of terrain (at the GM's discretion). Any of the hazards that are rendered safe reset themselves and become dangerous again at each midnight.</p>\n<h1>UNSEASONABLE WEATHER</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>regional curse; <strong>Area </strong>2-mile-radius emanation; <strong>Save </strong>Will DC 23 to remove</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The weather in the cursed region changes drastically, even bringing snow to a blazing desert. The area is plagued by your choice of cold weather conditions (<em>Core Rulebook </em>442), very hot conditions (<em>Core Rulebook </em>444), or frequent powerful storms (<em>Core Rulebook </em>438). The weather remains unpredictable, and can change over time (as determined by the GM), but the baseline weather is altered as long as the curse remains.</p>\n<p><strong>Cure </strong>The cursed weather can be returned to normal only by casting <em>remove curse </em>at the center of the affected area, followed by a casting of <em>control weather</em>.</p>\n<h1>CURSE TEMPLATES</h1>\n<p>Some curses function in an unusual fashion compared to others. The following section presents several templates that can be applied to any curse to represent variants of that curse. These templates function similarly to templates that can be applied to creatures, and you could potentially apply several templates to the same curse to create a truly horrifying effect.</p>\n<h1>CONTAGIOUS CURSE</h1>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>In addition to the curse's normal effect, the curse is transmissible to other creatures by a particular means. This could be similar to transmission methods for a disease, or it could be something more esoteric, such as by song or love.</p>\n<p><strong>Cure </strong>The accursed creature's attempts to remove its own curse with magic automatically fail, though other creatures can do so as normal. Whatever its other means of transmission, a creature attempting to cure the original creature's curse with magic is automatically exposed to the curse and must succeed at a saving throw to avoid being afflicted by it.</p>\n<h1>DEATH CURSE</h1>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>A death curse usually occurs upon the deaths of linnorms, some fey, or hags, but other creatures can also curse their killers. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the creature's Hit Dice + the creature's Charisma modifier, rather than the curse's normal DC. A death curse's effect is the same as the original curse, and the effect tends to vary based on the cursing creature's HD.</p>\n<p><strong>Cure </strong>In addition to the standard cures, the first time that the creature who placed the death curse returns to life, the accursed creature receives a new saving throw to break the curse. If the accursed contributes to this resurrection, she receives a +4 bonus on this saving throw.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>HD</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Death Curse</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1-5</td>\n<td>Minor haunting* or weeping wound*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6-10</td>\n<td><em>Bestow curse</em>, major haunting*, or tormenting visions*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11-15</td>\n<td>Doom of the hunted*, shattered self*, or unluck</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16-20</td>\n<td>Greater doom of the hunted* or sealed fate*</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>* New curse described in this section.</strong></p>\n<h1>GENERATIONAL CURSE</h1>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>In addition to cursing the original target creature, this curse continues to curse the target's children, and their children, and so on across multiple generations. It is possible it might carry on only to certain children (such as daughters or firstborn children).</p>\n<p><strong>Cure </strong>Generational curses can usually be cured only by special means, though the extinction of a family line also is able to end its threat. Even if <em>remove curse </em>can cure the curse on an individual target, it doesn't stop the generational curse from affecting future generations, which must deal with the curse in their own manner.</p>\n<p>^Horror Rules Running Horror Adventures</p>"}

Chapter 6: Running Horror Adventures}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Game Masters don't have to run a horror-themed Pathfinder adventure differently from how they would any other adventure-but they can. Before running a horror adventure, though, the GM should consider a basic question: Who is she trying to scare? That might seem obvious, but horror adventures are about fear, so the GM needs to understand the nature of that fear.</p>\n<p>If a GM doesn't want to scare anyone, she can incorporate this book's options into her game like those from any other Pathfinder RPG book. The options herein might feature darker themes, but that's all that makes them different.</p>\n<p>But perhaps a GM decides she does want to frighten someone, and naturally, she targets the player characters. In this case, the game changes to incorporate elements meant to shock the PCs or explore darker parts of the campaign setting. Ultimately, this probably doesn't mean much more than deciding which monsters and settings the game employs. An otherwise normal Pathfinder adventure featuring ghosts, haunted houses, faceless murderers, and similar creepiness might be all a GM needs to effectively spook the PCs.</p>\n<p>If the GM wants to frighten her players, she must do so with the utmost care and thought, making changes from how she would run other Pathfinder adventures. This doesn't mean making the game a farce to startle the participants. Rather, it gives the GM the opportunity to use her adventure like a storyteller telling a ghost story, using the medium to build tension and unnerve the other participants, each of whom expects to enjoy a good scare. This sort of game focuses on intentionally evoking feelings from the players themselves, rather than their characters. So long as the players know what they're in for and explicitly want to be scared, horror-themed games can be exceptionally memorable.</p>\n<p>This chapter includes tips on how to run any sort of horror adventure, describing various horror subgenres and including tips on how to create horror adventures, cultivate an unnerving atmosphere, and use the Pathfinder RPG rules to adjudicate terrifying encounters. Before any of that, though, the GM should understand how horror adventures differ from normal Pathfinder adventures and why she should take exceptional care to make sure her players are willing participants.</p>\n<p>^Running Horror Adventures Horror Gear and Magic Items</p>"}

Chapter 1: Horror Characters}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You salivate when blood is spilled, and struggle against the urge to sink your teeth into the necks of friends and innocents.</p>\n<h1>CATALYST</h1>\n<p>Being drained-but not killed-at least six times by a vampire within a month or less causes this corruption. Powerful vampires or curses can cause this corruption more rapidly.</p>\n<h1>Progression</h1>\n<p>Vampirism progresses when you feed off and kill a sentient creature. Each week, you need to drink the blood of sentient creatures one size category smaller than you or larger until you drain enough to deal Constitution damage equal to your manifestation level. If you don't have the fangs manifestation, you must feed on a helpless or willing creature. If you haven't drunk enough blood after a week, you must succeed at a Will save (DC = 15 + your manifestation level) each day until you have. If you fail, the next time you rest, your corruption takes over and you unconsciously hunt and feed, drinking a sentient creature dry. If circumstances make it impossible to feed (such as if you are tied down or in a locale with nothing to feed upon) you start to starve as if you had not eaten in 3 days (<em>Core Rulebook </em>445), and you continue to thirst for blood and struggle to escape and feed until you have received five times the amount of blood from sentient creatures you normally require. If your allies are able to restrain and feed you, your corruption doesn't progress. However, the DC of the Will save against your corruption progressing increases by 2. These increases stack, and last until your corruption reaches the next stage. Whenever you drop below 0 hit points, you must attempt a save as if you hadn't drunk enough blood that week.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 1</strong>: Once you feed on an innocent sentient creature, your alignment shifts one step toward evil and spells that detect undead sense you, though the peculiar result they return informs the caster that you're still a living creature. Other spells and effects don't treat you as undead.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 2</strong>: The second time this happens, your alignment shifts another step toward evil and you are affected by spells and abilities as if your creature type were undead (including <em>bane </em>and the favored enemy class feature). This doesn't grant you any of the immunities of being undead, nor does it make you immune to effects that target living creatures or change how negative and positive energy affect you.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 3</strong>: The third time this occurs, you become an NPC vampire under the GM's control.</p>\n<h1>Removing the Corruption</h1>\n<p>Ending the corruption requires eliminating the source, such as by slaying your progenitor vampire or ending your curse.</p>\n<h1>MANIFESTATIONS</h1>\n<p>The following are manifestations of the vampirism corruption.</p>\n<h1>Allure</h1>\n<p>You can influence others subtly, but lose your reflection.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain a +2 racial bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks. At manifestation level 3rd, these bonuses increase to +4.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You cast no reflection. While you're within 10 feet of a mirror or reflective surface, nearby creatures may notice something amiss (Perception DC 20). If they succeed by 5 or more, they notice your lack of reflection. When you reach manifestation level 3rd, a creature can present a mirror to you as a standard action to repel you. You must stay at least 5 feet away from the mirror and can't touch or make melee attacks against that creature. After 1 round, if the creature continues presenting the mirror, you can attempt a DC 25 Will save each round to ignore the repulsion for that round.</p>\n<h1>Children of the Night</h1>\n<p>You can summon foul beasts to faithfully serve you.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Once per day, you can summon a rat swarm or a wolf, as if using <em>summon nature's ally II </em>with a caster level equal to your character level. The creature serves you for 10 minutes or until destroyed. At manifestation level 3rd and every 2 manifestation levels thereafter, you can use this ability an additional time each day. At manifestation level 4th, you can spend two daily uses of this ability to summon a bat swarm.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You take a -3 penalty on Handle Animal and Ride checks against animals (except those you summon with this manifestation's gift). At manifestation level 5th, you affect non-hostile animals as if you had an unnatural aura (<em>Bestiary </em>281).</p>\n<h1>Dreadful Charm</h1>\n<p>Your powers of persuasion allow you to compel the weak.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Allure*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Once per day when you succeed at a Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check against a creature, you can charm that creature as if using <em>charm monster </em>with a caster level equal to your character level. If the creature fails its save, it's charmed for a number of minutes equal to your character level.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You no longer cast a shadow. Noticing this in normal or bright light requires a successful DC 15 Perception check. Also, if you're in an area that smells strongly of garlic, you must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 minutes. Immunities don't prevent this sickened condition.</p>\n<h1>Fangs</h1>\n<p>Your canines grow unnaturally long when you are angry.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You can, as a swift action, grow fangs that grant you a bite attack. This is a primary natural attack that deals 1d6 points of piercing damage if your size is Medium (1d4 if Small). You can dismiss the fangs as a move action. You can drain blood with your bite from a helpless creature as a standard action, or a pinned creature as a free action once per round immediately after succeeding at a combat maneuver check to pin the creature or maintain your pin. Each time you drain blood, you deal 1 point of Constitution damage. This counts toward the feeding you must do to avoid your corruption progressing; you needn't entirely drain and kill the creature. Draining blood changes your alignment only if you feed on an unwilling innocent.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: To avoid a saving throw against your corruption progressing, you must drink the requisite amount of blood each day instead of each week.</p>\n<h1>Greater Unlife</h1>\n<p>You can recover from nearly any wound.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 3rd, unlife*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: When you use the ability of the unlife manifestation, you gain fast healing 3 instead of fast healing 1. While the fast healing lasts, you are immune to nonlethal damage, ability damage, and ability drain, although you retain any you already had.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Whenever you're in direct sunlight, you're staggered instead of shaken. Nothing can remove or prevent this condition, but it ends once you're out of direct sunlight.</p>\n<h1>Life Drain</h1>\n<p>You can drain life from those you harm.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 2nd.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain a slam attack, a primary natural attack that deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage if your size is Medium (1d4 if Small). If you confirm a critical hit with this attack, you inflict 1 temporary negative level on the target. The DC to remove this negative level is equal to the standard corruption ability DC.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You are healed by negative energy and harmed by positive energy as if you were an undead creature.</p>\n<h1>True Unlife</h1>\n<p>You can cheat death.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 3rd, greater unlife*, unlife*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: When you're reduced to fewer than 0 hit points but not slain and you have a use of fast healing remaining, you immediately assume <em>gaseous form</em>, activate your fast healing, and remain conscious. Once you have more than 0 hit points, the effect ends. This delays the normal Will save against your corruption progressing until <em>gaseous form </em>ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: If you remain in direct sunlight, at the end of your second turn you burst into flame, taking 1d6 points of fire damage per manifestation level you have each round. This fire damage bypasses resistance or immunity and can't be prevented. The fire damage and staggered condition end as soon as you get out of direct sunlight. If you are reduced to fewer than 0 hit points while in direct sunlight, you are slain and can't be brought back to life without <em>true resurrection</em>.</p>\n<h1>Unlife</h1>\n<p>You heal at a phenomenal rate.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Manifestation level 3rd.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: As a standard action a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your manifestation level, you can grant yourself fast healing 1 for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: While you're in direct sunlight, you become shaken. Nothing can remove this condition, nor does immunity to fear prevent it, but it ends as soon as you are no longer in sunlight.</p>\n<h1>Vampiric Grace</h1>\n<p>You move with a predator's grace.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Manifestation level 2nd.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain Dodge as a bonus feat and a +2 racial bonus on Stealth checks. At manifestation level 6th, you can climb walls (as per <em>spider climb</em>) at will.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You can enter a private dwelling only if invited in by someone with the authority to do so, unless you succeed at a DC 30 Will save. If you fail, you can never retry the save, but you can enter if you're later invited inside.</p>"}

Chapter 2: Archetypes And Class Options}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Phantoms can be malevolent or benign, but none are to be trifled with. Spiritualists dare to let those phantoms roam free within their psyches while channeling them to unleash insubstantial and ectoplasmic terrors upon their foes.</p>\n<h1>Exciter (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Psychic magic draws upon the twin and sometimes opposed powers of thought and emotion, but an exciter cares little for rationality. The phantom that accompanies him fills him with unbridled exultation, as he lets feeling and passion rule and sharpen his mind and body into a glorious fusion.</p>\n<p><strong>Merged Phantom</strong>: An exciter internalizes his phantom and merges it completely within his mind. He cannot fully manifest his phantom outside of his own body in incorporeal or ectoplasmic form. Emotional focus abilities that affect or require a manifested phantom are lost, except for any aura gained by the phantom at 7th level; if the phantom gains an aura at 7th level, this aura functions despite the phantom not being manifested, and is centered on the exciter.</p>\n<p>This ability alters phantom and emotional focus and replaces the 6th-level phantom recall.</p>\n<p><strong>Rapture (Su)</strong>: An exciter gains the ability to enter an ecstatic state in which he's consumed and overwhelmed by his passions and driven into a fighting fury. This functions similarly to a bloodrager's bloodrage (<em>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide </em>15), treating his spiritualist level as his bloodrager level, though he doesn't qualify for feats or other elements that require rage or bloodrage. When entering a rapture, the exciter loses all other benefits from having his phantom confined in his consciousness (such as the Skill Focus feats and bonus against mind-affecting effects), but he can choose to exchange the normal +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution scores normally gained from bloodrage for a +4 morale bonus to his Dexterity and Charisma scores or a +2 morale bonus to his Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma scores. In addition to the fatigue for ending a bloodrage, an exciter can't enter a rapture again for 1 minute after ending his last rapture.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces a spiritualist's ability to manifest his phantom and use emotional focus abilities that require a manifested phantom.</p>\n<p><strong>Fast Movement (Ex)</strong>: An exciter's land speed is faster than normal for his race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor and is not carrying a heavy load. This doesn't stack with the barbarian ability of the same name.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces etheric tether.</p>\n<p><strong>Excitation (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, when an exciter is in a rapture, each round he can choose to intensify his emotional fury, expending 2 rounds of rapture instead of 1. When he uses excitation, he chooses one of the two abilities that his emotional focus would normally grant to a manifested phantom, such as strength focus and powerful strike for an anger phantom, or power from despair and miserable strike for a despair phantom. He gains these abilities until the beginning of his next turn. If the ability normally augments only a phantom's slam attacks, it instead applies to the ectoplasmic tendrils that the spiritualist can sprout using his ectoplasmic bonded manifestation.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces bonded senses.</p>\n<p><strong>Rapturous Rage</strong>: At 10th level and every 4 spiritualist levels thereafter, an exciter can select one rage power for which he qualifies, treating his spiritualist level as his barbarian level for all purposes relating to that particular rage power (he still doesn't qualify for the Extra Rage Power feat or any similar abilities).</p>\n<p>This ability replaces the 10th-, 14th-, and 18th-level phantom recall and spiritual bond.</p>\n<p><strong>Perfect Passion (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, an exciter can cast psychic spells with an emotion component (<em>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures </em>144) even while in his rapture. He can cast these spells defensively and attempt concentration checks for these spells without impairment, despite being in a rapture. He also can attempt Charisma- and Intelligence-based skill checks related to psychic spells with an emotion component while in his rapture. He cannot cast arcane or divine spells or psychic spells that have a thought component while in a rapture.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces spiritual interference.</p>\n<p><strong>Overwhelming Excitement (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, an exciter can share the effects of his rapture with willing allies within 10 feet. He must expend 2 additional rounds of his rapture each round for each ally sharing its effects. The exciter's allies share all effects of the rapture except the rage powers; each ally must end its turn within 10 feet of the exciter, or the effects of the rapture end for that ally and it becomes fatigued.</p>\n<p>Whenever he is not sharing the effects of his rapture with an ally, the exciter now retains the benefits of his phantom in his consciousness even during rapture.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces fused consciousness.</p>\n<p><strong>Greater Rapture (Su)</strong>: At 12th level, an exciter increases the morale bonus his rapture grants to each applicable ability score by 2 and the morale bonus he gains on Will saves by 1. In addition, upon entering a rapture, he can apply the effects of a single spiritualist spell he knows with an emotion component to himself. The spell must have a range of touch or personal, and it must be a 1st- or 2nd-level spell. For every 3 spiritualist levels he has beyond 12th, the maximum spell level of this spell increases by 1. If he uses this ability to apply the effects of a spell again before the duration of the previous spell expires, the previous spell ends immediately.</p>\n<p>This replaces greater spiritual interference.</p>\n<h1>Necrologist (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>All spiritualists call upon residual phantoms that cling to the living world through force of will and unresolved passion. The vile spiritualists known as necrologists reach farther toward the Negative Energy Plane, however, and for whatever evil purpose, they bring back malevolent spirits whose passions have turned to vengeance and hate for all life.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Only an evil character can contact a malevolent undead phantom and take the necrologist archetype. If a necrologist becomes nonevil, she can continue to take spiritualist levels, but her phantom ceases to give her benefits while in her consciousness, she can't use bonded manifestation, and if she manifests the phantom, it is no longer loyal to her and likely attacks her and her allies.</p>\n<p>This alters the spiritualist's alignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Spells</strong>: A necrologist adds the following spells to her class list: 1st-<em>hide from undead</em>; 2nd-<em>ghostly disguise</em>(UM), <em>haunting mists</em>(UM); 3rd-<em>haunting choir</em>(UM); 4th-<em>lesser age resistance</em>(UM); 5th-<em>age resistance</em>(UM); 6th-<em>greater age resistance </em>(UM),<em> create greater undead</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Shared Consciousness</strong>: A necrologist gains a bonus on saving throws against death effects, energy drain, and negative energy rather than against mind-affecting effects (and can shunt such an effect onto the phantom) when her undead phantom is contained within her consciousness.</p>\n<p>This ability alters shared consciousness.</p>\n<p><strong>Undead Phantom</strong>: A necrologist's phantom is undead, rather than an outsider. It has normal undead immunities and no Constitution score; uses d8 Hit Dice, each of which is modified by the phantom's Charisma modifier as normal; and gains the abilities below at the levels indicated. An undead phantom otherwise follows the standard phantom rules (for instance, its base attack bonus and skills don't change to match undead).</p>\n<p><em>Cling of the Grave (Su)</em>: An undead phantom can hold the charge on a touch spell of the necromancy school up to a maximum of 1 round per spiritualist level of the necrologist.</p>\n<p>This ability alters share spells.</p>\n<p><em>Unnatural aura (Su)</em>: At 5th level, animals do not willingly approach within 30 feet of a fully manifested undead phantom unless the necrologist succeeds at a Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check (DC = 10 + 1/2 the necrologist's spiritualist level + the phantom's Charisma modifier).</p>\n<p>This replaces the slam damage increase gained at 5th level.</p>\n<p><em>Channel Resistance (Su)</em>: At 6th level, a necrologist's phantom gains a +4 bonus on saving throws to resist the effects of channel energy.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces devotion.</p>\n<p><em>Lifedrinker (Su)</em>: At 13th level, when a necrologist's phantom reduces a creature to fewer than 0 hit points with an attack or spell, the necrologist can expend one use of her channel energy ability as a swift action to affect the same target with <em>death knell</em>. If the target fails its save, the necrologist can choose either herself or her phantom to gain the benefit of the spell.</p>\n<p>This replaces the necrologist's slam damage increase gained at 13th level.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonded Manifestation</strong>: A necrologist cannot use ectoplasmic bonded manifestation.</p>\n<p>This ability alters bonded manifestation.</p>\n<p><strong>Channel Energy (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, a necrologist gains the ability to channel negative energy, with an effective cleric level equal to her spiritualist level - 3. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + her Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces spiritual interference.</p>\n<p><strong>Necropsychic Conduit</strong>: At 12th level, a necrologist can cast psychic spells as if she had the Thanatopic Spell(UM) and Threnodic Spell(UM) metamagic feats, using her undead phantom as a conduit to pierce the defenses of undead creatures. If her phantom has been banished or is not within 30 feet of her when she casts the spells, however, these feats have no effect.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces greater spiritual interference.</p>\n<p>^Archetypes and Class Options Feats</p>"}

Chapter 2: Archetypes and Class Options","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<p>@Compendium[pf-content.horror-adventures.jsEW1pMN3Ds5FXmw]{(Index) Horror Adventures}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.horror-adventures.qet8A89j9mn1czfm]{2.0. Chapter 2: Archetypes And Class Options}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Some crazed clerics venerate otherworldly entities of inconceivable power with minds and philosophies utterly alien to humanity-the Outer Gods and the Great Old Ones of the Elder Mythos. These beings may not even realize they are worshiped by insignificant mortals, and those who venerate them are often quite insane.</p>\n<h1>Elder Mythos Cultist (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Typically grasping, secretive, and thoroughly mad, Elder Mythos cultists open their bodies and minds to horrifying realities not meant for the sane as they strive to prepare the world for the eventual return of their alien masters.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: An Elder Mythos cultist must be chaotic evil or chaotic neutral.</p>\n<p>This alters the cleric's required alignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Deities</strong>: An Elder Mythos cultist must worship an Outer God or Great Old One.</p>\n<p><strong>Domains</strong>: An Elder Mythos cultist receives only a single domain, chosen from the following list: Chaos, Madness, or Void. He can choose any subdomain of those domains offered by an Outer God or Great Old One he worships.</p>\n<p>This ability alters domains.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbidden Knowledge (Ex)</strong>: An Elder Mythos cultist gains a +2 profane bonus on all Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (dungeoneering), Knowledge (history), Knowledge (planes), and Knowledge (religion) checks, and can attempt these checks untrained. This bonus doubles if the check is related to the Elder Mythos.</p>\n<p><strong>Unhinged Mind (Ex)</strong>: Bartering sanity for unspeakable knowledge, an Elder Mythos cultist props up his crumbling sanity with a darkly enigmatic personality. An Elder Mythos cultist uses Charisma instead of Wisdom as his key spellcasting ability score (to determine his spell DCs, bonus spells per day, bonus on concentration checks, and so on), to determine the effects and number of uses of his domain powers, and to modify his Will saving throws. However, because of the fragile state of his mind, the Elder Mythos cultist takes a -2 penalty on Will saves to resist mind-affecting effects. An Elder Mythos cultist automatically fails any save to resist the effects of <em>confusion</em>, <em>insanity</em>, and <em>nightmare</em>, and other similar effects so long as the effect's caster level is higher than his character level.</p>\n<p><strong>Channel the Void (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, when an Elder Mythos cultist channels energy, he taps into the unthinkable void between the stars. This is similar to channeling negative energy, but instead of healing undead, this blast of energy harms and devours living beings, corporeal non-skeletal undead, and constructs crafted from flesh (such as flesh golems). This is not negative energy damage; instead, the damage manifests in the form of wounds from supernatural deterioration and rot. A creature that would take damage from this energy can attempt a Fortitude save to halve the damage, rather than a Will save. At 8th level, a creature that both fails the Fortitude save and would be killed or destroyed by this effect is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature's equipment is unaffected. This ability still counts as channel energy, but it counts as neither positive nor negative energy specifically (for example, the Elder Mythos cultist couldn't take the Turn Undead or Command Undead feat). For the purposes of feats that require channel energy but refer to what happens if the character channels positive or negative energy, this ability alters the listed effect for negative energy. For instance, an Elder Mythos cultist could use Channel Smite to damage living or fleshy creatures with his melee attack.</p>\n<p>This ability alters channel energy and replaces spontaneous casting.</p>\n<p><strong>Maddening Gaze (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, as a standard action, an Elder Mythos cultist can focus his gaze on a single living creature within 30 feet and inundate the creature's mind with visions of alien horror. The target takes 2 points of Wisdom damage and becomes confused and sickened for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the Elder Mythos cultist's cleric level + his Charisma modifier) negates the Wisdom damage and the confusion effect, though the target is sickened for 1 round. This gaze attack is a mind-affecting effect. An Elder Mythos cultist can use this ability once per day at 5th level, plus an additional time per day for every 3 cleric levels thereafter.</p>\n<p>At 11th level, the target takes 1d6+1 points of Wisdom damage and is confused and sickened for 2d4 rounds. A successful Will save reduces the Wisdom damage to 1 point, and the target is instead sickened for 1d6 rounds.</p>\n<p>At 19th level, the target takes 2d6 points of Wisdom damage and is rendered permanently confused and sickened. Only <em>greater restoration</em>, <em>heal</em>, <em>limited wish</em>, <em>miracle</em>, or <em>wish </em>can remove the confused and sickened conditions. A successful Will save halves the Wisdom damage, and the target is instead sickened for 2d6 rounds.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces the increases to channel energy gained at 5th, 11th, and 19th levels.</p>\n<h1>NEW DOMAIN</h1>\n<p>The following domain is available to followers of Azathoth, Cthulhu, Hastur, Shub-Niggurath, and Yog-Sothoth, as well as various daemon harbingers. If a domain ability calls for a saving throw, the DC of the save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the character's cleric level + his Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h1>Void Domain</h1>\n<p><strong>Granted Powers</strong>: You can call upon the cold darkness between the stars to gain flight, travel to other worlds, or summon monsters from beyond to do your bidding.</p>\n<p><em>Guarded Mind (Ex)</em>: You gain a +2 insight bonus on saving throws against all mind-affecting effects.</p>\n<p><em>Part the Veil (Su)</em>: At 8th level, you can lace spells you cast with the raw madness that waits in the outer darkness. Activating this ability is a swift action that you must use as you cast a spell that targets a single creature and allows a Will saving throw to negate or reduce the spell's primary effect. If the target fails to resist the spell, the target is also confused for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level as visions of the void cause temporary insanity.</p>\n<p>The victim can attempt a new saving throw each round to end the effect-these additional saving throws apply only to the additional confusion effect and not to the original spell effect. Part the veil is a mind-affecting effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your class level.</p>\n<p><strong>Domain Spells</strong>: 1st-<em>feather fall</em>, 2nd-<em>levitate</em>, 3rd-<em>fly</em>, 4th-<em>lesser planar binding</em>, 5th-<em>overland flight</em>, 6th-<em>planar binding</em>, 7th-<em>reverse gravity</em>, 8th-<em>greater planar binding</em>, 9th- <em>interplanetary teleport</em>(UM).</p>\n<h1>NEW SUBDOMAINS</h1>\n<p>The Void domain has the following subdomains. If a subdomain ability calls for a saving throw, the DC of the save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the character's cleric level + his Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h1>Dark Tapestry</h1>\n<p><strong>Associated Domain</strong>: Void.</p>\n<p><strong>Associated Deities</strong>: Azathoth, Cthulhu, Hastur, Shub-Niggurath, Yog-Sothoth.</p>\n<p><strong>Replacement Power</strong>: The following granted power replaces the guarded mind power of the Void domain.</p>\n<p><em>It Came from Beyond (Su)</em>: Once per day, when you cast a summoning spell, any one creature you summon is more powerful than normal. The creature gains the advanced creature simple template. If you summon more than one creature with a spell, only one of the summoned creatures gains the advanced creature simple template. A summoned creature that gains the advanced creature simple template in this manner appears unnaturally deformed or hideous, bringing with it a whiff of the emptiness of the void. This ability works only on spells you cast as a cleric-it does not work on spellcasting abilities gained from any other spellcasting classes you might have.</p>\n<p><strong>Replacement Domain Spells</strong>: 2nd-<em>summon monster II</em>, 5th-<em>summon monster V</em>, 7th-<em>insanity</em>.</p>\n<h1>Isolation</h1>\n<p><strong>Associated Domain</strong>: Void.</p>\n<p><strong>Associated Deities</strong>: Daemon harbingers with the Void domain.</p>\n<p><strong>Replacement Power</strong>: The following granted power replaces the part the veil power of the Void domain.</p>\n<p><em>aura of Isolation (Su)</em>: As a standard action, you can create a 20-foot aura that causes enemies within to be overcome with feelings of isolation and loss. Your enemies treat the aura as difficult terrain, as they become sluggish within its area of effect. Furthermore, while within the aura, your enemies cannot provide flanking, nor can they use or benefit from the aid another action. The aura lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier, but the rounds need not be consecutive. This is a mind-affecting emotion effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Replacement Domain Spells</strong>: 4th-<em>crushing despair</em>, 6th- <em>wall of force</em>, 8th-<em>prismatic wall</em>.</p>\n<h1>Stars</h1>\n<p><strong>Associated Domain</strong>: Void.</p>\n<p><strong>Associated Deities</strong>: Azathoth, Cthulhu, Hastur, Shub-Niggurath, Yog-Sothoth.</p>\n<p><strong>Replacement Power</strong>: The following granted power replaces the part the veil power of the Void domain.</p>\n<p><em>The Stars are Right (Su)</em>: If you prepare cleric spells while the stars are visible to you, you can spontaneously cast any of your Stars subdomain spells by swapping out a spell of an equal spell level. Casting a Stars subdomain spell while the stars are visible to you restores an amount of hit point damage equal to the spell's level to you; this effect happens as you cast the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Replacement Domain Spells</strong>: 2nd-<em>hypnotic pattern</em>, 7th- <em>sunbeam</em>, 9th-<em>meteor swarm</em>.</p>\n<p>^Archetypes and Class Options Feats</p>"}

Chapter 2: Archetypes And Class Options}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Some mediums channel dark legendary spirits that bestow sinister and malevolent abilities.</p>\n<h1>LEGENDARY SPIRITS</h1>\n<p>Gaining the ability to channel one of the following legendary spirits involves performing a certain deed, swearing an oath, and succeeding at an ability check (DC = 10 + 1/2 the medium's level). If the medium breaks the oath, the spirit will no longer answer when he calls. If the medium attempts to call another spirit of the legendary spirit's legend, the legendary spirit similarly departs forever. A legendary spirit grants new abilities but otherwise uses the same rules as the original legend. For instance, the Butcher replaces the favored locations, taboos, lesser spirit power, and intermediate spirit power from the champion spirit but still uses the champion's spirit bonus, seance boon, influence penalty, greater spirit power, and supreme spirit power.</p>\n<h1>Butcher (Champion)</h1>\n<p>The Butcher is a spirit of blood, violence, murder, and pain.</p>\n<p><strong>Gaining Favor</strong>: To gain the Butcher's favor, you must deal a total number of hit points of bleed damage equal to twice your medium level to two dozen non-mindless living creatures, inflicting as much pain and suffering as possible. You must next vow to never use the Heal skill or magical healing to heal or treat another creature, then succeed at a Strength check.</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Locations</strong>: Abattoirs, battlefields, execution sites.</p>\n<p><strong>Taboo</strong>: If you accept a taboo while channeling the Butcher, you must not attack with bludgeoning weapons in combat and must never deal nonlethal damage. You must also kill all your defeated foes in combat, although you can accept surrender or take prisoners for the purpose of torturing and then killing those prisoners later (but before the Butcher departs).</p>\n<p><strong>Bladesharp (Lesser, Ex)</strong>: You gain proficiency in all slashing martial weapons and the spiked chain. Any slashing weapon or spiked chain you wield gains the deadly weapon special quality (<em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment </em>22) and on a critical hit deals an amount of bleed damage equal to the weapon's critical multiplier - 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Bloodletter (Intermediate, Ex)</strong>: The Butcher enhances a single slashing weapon or spiked chain, allowing you to add the <em>keen</em>, <em>mighty cleaving</em>, or <em>wounding </em>special abilities to the weapon when you wield it. As a swift action, you can allow the Butcher to gain 1 point of influence over you to make that weapon <em>vorpal </em>until the end of your turn, though the <em>vorpal </em>special ability doesn't work with abilities that let you choose the result of your d20 roll. Each time you kill a creature whose CR is greater than your medium level with this <em>vorpal </em>special ability, the butcher gains an additional point of influence over you.</p>\n<h1>Deceiver (Trickster)</h1>\n<p>The Deceiver is the prince of prevarication.</p>\n<p><strong>Gaining Favor</strong>: To gain the Deceiver's favor, you must successfully lie to 100 different sentient creatures, convincing each one of a different lie that somehow leads to its death or other great misfortune. You must then vow to never make a truthful statement, except to answer a question whose answer is clearly already known to the asker (such as the color of the sky), and succeed at a Charisma check.</p>\n<p><strong>Spirit Bonus</strong>: When you channel the Deceiver, your spirit bonus applies to Charisma checks, Charisma-based skill checks, and Will saves against compulsions and divinations.</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Locations</strong>: Bordellos, courtrooms, gambling dens, taverns.</p>\n<p><strong>Skilled Deceiver (Lesser, Ex)</strong>: You add 1/2 your medium level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Shift Blame (Greater, Ex)</strong>: When you provoke an attack of opportunity from a given enemy, you can divert that attack of opportunity to another target of your choice within the attacker's reach. Afterward, the foe whose attack you diverted becomes immune to this ability for 24 hours. When you target a creature with a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability, or when you fail a Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check, you can allow the Deceiver to gain 1 point of influence over you to make the target believe another creature adjacent to you created the effect or attempted to lie to, convince, or bully the target.</p>\n<h1>Heretic (Hierophant)</h1>\n<p>The Heretic warps the faith of a good deity.</p>\n<p><strong>Gaining Favor</strong>: To gain the Heretic's favor, you must first pervert the worship of a congregation of worshipers of a good deity to evil. You must then vow to corrupt, debase, and violate the worship of that deity and never perform a truly altruistic act, and finally succeed at a Charisma check.</p>\n<p><strong>Spirit Bonus</strong>: When you channel the Heretic, your spirit bonus applies to Charisma checks, Charisma-based skill checks, and Will saves.</p>\n<p><strong>Seance Boon</strong>: For the purpose of spells and effects that have an effect based on which deity you worship, you count as worshiping the deity chosen in your vow. For the purpose of divinations, your alignment is the same as the deity's, and you have an aura corresponding to that deity's alignment as if you were a cleric of that deity. This doesn't alter other effects based on alignment, like smite evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Locations</strong>: Hidden shrines, repositories of dark knowledge, sacrificial altars, temples.</p>\n<p><strong>Heresy (Lesser, Su)</strong>: This functions as the divine surge lesser spirit power but you gain the following inquisitor spells at the indicated spell levels, instead of selecting a set of cleric spells each day: 0-<em>guidance</em>; 1st-<em>divine favor</em>; 2nd- <em>castigate</em>(APG); 3rd-<em>terrible remorse</em>(UM); 4th-<em>reprobation</em>(UM); 5th- <em>mass castigate</em>(APG); 6th-<em>overwhelming presence</em>(UM). Whenever you use your spirit surge on a skill check or ability check to convince or trick someone into perverting his faith in the good deity you chose with your vow, the Heretic is pleased and does not gain the usual point of influence over you.</p>\n<p><strong>False Font (Intermediate, Su)</strong>: You gain the effects of the energy font intermediate spirit power, but you must match the faith you chose to pervert, meaning that you always channel positive energy and add cure spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Stolen Grace (Greater, Su)</strong>: When a member of your chosen faith who believes that you are a member of that faith's clergy requests you to cast a cleric spell of a spell level you can cast, you can allow the Heretic to gain 1 point of influence over you and expend a spell slot of the appropriate level to cast the spell.</p>\n<h1>Lich (Archmage)</h1>\n<p>The Lich is a spirit of power over death and the undead.</p>\n<p><strong>Gaining Favor</strong>: To gain the Lich's favor, you must research fragments of how to create a personal phylactery and then outline a plan for lichdom. This requires spending 2 months visiting libraries and sites of necromantic power, followed by a successful Intelligence check. You must then vow to never destroy an intelligent undead creature, even if it attacks you first (though it is perfectly acceptable to control it with magic).</p>\n<p><strong>Seance Boon</strong>: You gain a +4 bonus on damage rolls with your necromancy spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Locations</strong>: Battlefields, graveyards, tombs.</p>\n<p><strong>Taboos</strong>: If you accept a taboo while channeling the Lich, you must not use beneficial spells on living creatures (except yourself if you are a living creature).</p>\n<p><strong>Necromantic Arcana (Lesser, Su)</strong>: This functions as the archmage arcana lesser spirit power, except you gain the following spells at the indicated spell levels (even if they are not the usual spell levels for the sorcerer/wizard spell list), instead of selecting them each day: 0-<em>bleed</em>; 1st-<em>chill touch</em>; 2nd-<em>command undead</em>; 3rd-<em>animate dead</em>; 4th-<em>enervation</em>; 5th-<em>magic jar</em>; 6th-<em>create greater undead</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Lesser Lichdom (Greater, Su)</strong>: In order to benefit from this power, you must have a proto-phylactery that costs you 10,000 gp to create (if you continue with the process of lichdom, you can upgrade this to a true phylactery by paying the difference in cost). If you die while channeling the Lich, you return from the dead in 1d10 days, reforming around the proto-phylactery and gaining 1 permanent negative level (as if subject to the <em>resurrection </em>spell). This process consumes the proto-phylactery. If you are already a lich, you can instead create a backup phylactery for 10,000 gp, at which you reform if your normal phylactery is destroyed. This consumes the backup phylactery.</p>\n<h1>Terminator (Guardian)</h1>\n<p>The Terminator is a stoic spirit of relentless death.</p>\n<p><strong>Gaining Favor</strong>: To gain the Terminator's favor, you must engage in over 1 hour (600 combat rounds) of actual life-or-death battle in the same day, refusing to cease because of either fatigue or mercy. In addition to the battles themselves, this requires a Constitution check. If you succeed, you must swear an oath to never retreat from combat and to eschew all mercy, always killing unconscious, captured, or surrendered foes, regardless of extenuating circumstances.</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Locations</strong>: Arenas, fortifications under siege, places of violence.</p>\n<p><strong>Bloodless (Lesser, Su)</strong>: You automatically stabilize when at negative hit points, and you are killed only if your negative hit point total exceeds double your Constitution score. In addition, you can allow the Terminator to gain 1 point of influence over you to automatically end any bleed or blood drain effect or effect with the pain(UM) descriptor. Doing so is not an action, so you can do this even if you are unconscious.</p>\n<p><strong>Emotionless Killer (Intermediate, Su)</strong>: You are immune to emotion(UM) effects, including fear, but you can't benefit from morale bonuses or bardic performances.</p>\n<h1>Warmonger (Marshal)</h1>\n<p>The Warmonger is a spirit of unbridled strife, inspiring others to throw their lives away in pursuit of hatred and vengeance.</p>\n<p><strong>Gaining Favor</strong>: To gain the Warmonger's favor, you must intentionally incite a war or blood feud between two groups (which could be nations but don't have to be) that results in at least 36 deaths. You must then swear an oath to never allow quarter or truce or to compromise with those who will not meet your demands, and succeed at a Charisma check.</p>\n<p><strong>Favored Locations</strong>: Barracks, battlefields, fortresses, throne rooms.</p>\n<p><strong>No Mercy (Lesser, Su)</strong>: You can use spirit surge on your own attack rolls or those of allies within 30 feet who participated in your seance, as long as you have line of sight and line of effect. You can also use your spirit surge when an enemy takes an action that would provoke an attack of opportunity from you or such an ally who threatens that enemy. If you do so, you or an ally of your choice who threatens that enemy can make an attack of opportunity and add your spirit surge, and that attack of opportunity does not count against your normal limit for the round or your ally's. When you use a spirit surge on an attack roll and the attack hits, the spirit surge benefit also applies to the damage roll.</p>\n<p><strong>Warmonger's Way (Intermediate, Su)</strong>: Add the following spells of spell levels you can currently cast to your list of spells known of those levels: 1st-<em>command, murderous command</em>(UM); 2nd-<em>rage, tactical acumen</em>(UC); 3rd-<em>confusion, fear</em>; 4th-<em>battlemind link</em>(UM), <em>song of discord</em>. You can also use your spirit surge on concentration and caster level checks when you cast these spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Inspiring Call (Greater, Su)</strong>: You gain the marshal's intermediate spirit power of the same name, but you can activate it as a move action. This improves to a swift action if you have the legendary marshal legendary spirit power.</p>\n<p>^Archetypes and Class Options Feats</p>"}

Chapter 6: Running Horror Adventures}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Typically, when creating a Pathfinder adventure, a GM begins with nothing more than the kernel of an idea-a setting she wants to explore, a monster she wants to use, or a scheme on which she'd like to elaborate. This basic idea provides the framework upon which she hangs the other elements of the story. A GM can create a horror adventure in the same manner.</p>\n<p>Chapter 1 of the&nbsp;<em>GameMastery Guide&nbsp;</em>provides extensive details on creating and running adventures. As horror adventures are just another type of Pathfinder RPG adventure, all of that advice still pertains. The difference, though, is that now the GM has an additional goal: to make the story scary. The following advice supplements the advice in the&nbsp;<em>GameMastery Guide&nbsp;</em>to help GMs do just that.</p>\n<h1>Know the Medium</h1>\n<p>Through the entire adventure design process, GMs should keep in mind that they're not writing a horror novel or screenplay-they're writing a horror RPG adventure. It's easy to get distracted by nuanced lore and charismatic villains, but all GMs should remember that the PCs are the stars of the story and ultimately the most important characters. Along with this, remember that Pathfinder characters have a variety of magic and other options that might allow them to make things that frighten everyday people meaningless or that instantly reveal any secrets. Therefore, it's important for GMs to know characters' strengths as much as their weaknesses and customize the adventure to play upon what they fear most (see below for more details). These powers might be daunting in their effects or variety, but each ability might provide a new way to reveal terrors.</p>\n<h1>Choose the Terror</h1>\n<p>Once a GM has decided to create a frightening adventure, what sort of terror should be included? As explained in the discussion of horror subgenres, there are many types of horror. A GM should be able to boil her horror story down to something basic, perhaps even a singular fear. This might be as primal as a fear of spiders or of losing one's teeth, or it could be more sophisticated, like the fear of abandonment or mechanical disasters. Once the GM has chosen a fear, then she can choose an avatar or incarnation of that fear. This might be a monster, person, or other threat that embodies that fear and proliferates it. For example, nothing exploits a fear of spiders quite like giant spiders or spider swarms, while representing the fear of abandonment might require a creature like an attic whisperer(B2) or the spirit of a bitter old man who waits for death but can't be convinced that he's dead. This avatar can be anything a GM wants. Feel free to make it more terrifying or unnatural if that helps-the giant spiders could actually be scheming Leng spiders(B2), or the attic whisperer might control an army of animated dolls. This can work as mere flavor, or a GM might search out rules (or designs of her own) to back it up. Remember that the chosen threat might not need to be a literal embodiment; for instance, a fear of alien abductions and experimentation is literally embodied by grays(B5) but also metaphorically embodied by derros.</p>\n<h1>Spread the Terror</h1>\n<p>Once the incarnation of a fear is chosen, the GM can then support it with surroundings and allies that evoke the same theme. Horror often takes place at night since the dark holds the promise of lurking threats, but a horror tale might take place anytime or anywhere with a disturbing atmosphere that reinforces the chosen menace. For example, the tooth fairies(B4) that embody the fear of loosing teeth might have created an underground hive constructed from billions of molars, and a mechanical terror could unfold in a half-functioning clock tower. Whatever the choice, it should provide challenges for the characters to overcome, as this-or another later setting- will likely become a sort of dungeon to explore.</p>\n<p>While the horrors of fiction and film often work alone, such is rarely the case in Pathfinder adventures. GMs should choose lesser threats that prop up the horror's main avatar. These might be its allies, opportunistic hangers on, deranged victims, the remnants of the creature's work, or the source of the creature's monstrousness. These allies might be less powerful than a primary foe, or at the very least, less actively horrific. For example, the Leng spiders might surround themselves with a cult of ettercaps, while the tooth faeries might feed their stolen teeth to a half-slumbering, albino purple worm. Traps, hazards, haunts, and other challenges should provide lesser encounters that grant the PCs experience but also winnow away their resources, causing them to face the final threat with some vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h1>Fear from the Unexpected</h1>\n<p>While the Pathfinder rules present a finite number of statistics and rules options, how a GM pieces them together allows for infinite scenarios. In the case of horror adventures, this also means infinite opportunities to shock even the most jaded, rules-obsessed players. Opportunities abound in adventures to surprise the characters by revealing terrible secrets or presenting images that make them realize things are far worse than expected. For example, perhaps the PCs find a life-sized mother doll among the attic whisper's collection, one that's tending to a mewling newborn. Or maybe the automatic clock-winder at the top of the clock tower is rebuilding the interior to account for a thirteenth hour that occurs only once every eon.</p>\n<p>While startling revelations in a narrative are most powerful, a GM can also twist the game rules specifically to unsettle the players.</p>\n<p><strong>Mask Monsters</strong>: There's no reason a GM must adhere to the basic bestiary descriptions of monsters. By adjusting or completely revising monster descriptions, she gains not only new versatility from the bestiaries, but also the adventure-perfect foe for whatever terror she's unleashed. The PCs might be horrified by the thrashing pile of snakes and maggots that tangle their legs, knocking them into its squirming maws, but behind the GM screen are just the stats for a wolf.</p>\n<p><strong>Transform Monsters</strong>: Veteran players might immediately identify a ravenous corpse as a ghoul, but if the tooth faeries have stolen its teeth, perhaps its bite attack is changed to a harmless, wet gnawing. While this might mean the ghoul is less powerful, the shock and revulsion it evokes is far more important to a horror adventure than dealing 1d6 points of damage. Altering creature statistics can be easy, particularly if a GM does so with the intention of creating unsettling encounters, not of making a creature more powerful. Use the&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary&nbsp;</em>appendices to swap around attack types or perhaps exchange abilities with creatures of similar CRs. As long as a GM doesn't intentionally combine powers that can be exploited for some lethal synergy, such a unique encounter should be fine. And if a GM accidentally improvises something that's more deadly than it is narratively unsettling, she can err in the PCs' favor and keep the story moving. The Rules Improvisation section (see page 206) includes tips on how to make the Pathfinder RPG rules work for a horror tale.</p>\n<p><strong>Warp Reality</strong>: The rules are the physics of the game-the laws of what can and can't happen-and sometimes the most unsettling thing a GM can do in horror adventure is plan to break those rules. Maybe the PCs have a bizarre group nightmare, are pursued by a reality warping mothman(B2), or begin to lose their minds. Regardless, a GM can convey this by having the game not work the way the PCs expect. Maybe a&nbsp;<em>detect magic&nbsp;</em>spell reveals its information as a chorus of screams, an isolated character can momentarily walk on walls, time reverses for an instant, or when a PC tries to use an ability, he's told it doesn't work, without explanation. These tricks work best when used sparingly and when the PCs' lives aren't in jeopardy, because they signal that perhaps the world isn't as reliable (or unbiased) as the characters thought.</p>\n<h1>Horrible Success, Terrible Rewards</h1>\n<p>In most Pathfinder adventures, the PCs are destined to succeed. When running a horror adventure, that doesn't necessarily mean it should be more challenging, and it certainly shouldn't be a guaranteed total party kill. Most of the time, a GM wants the PCs to be unsettled by the story instead of their die rolls, so she should plan for the PCs' success; many adventures have horrific consequences for failure, but in a horror adventure, consider the various ways that success, too, could have horrific consequences.</p>\n<p>During the course of the adventure, the PCs should have numerous victories over lesser enemies, traps, haunts, and other challenges. This is standard for Pathfinder adventures, and a GM should reward the PCs as normal with experience and treasure. Follow the usual rules for awarding experience, but don't save experience just for successful combat encounters. Horror adventures often include investigation, research, and roleplaying encounters. If a GM wants players to take those elements of the game just as seriously as the combat encounters, she can reward them for successes in those arenas-typically with an XP reward equal to their average party level. See the discussion on page 204 for more details on using experience in horror adventures.</p>\n<p>Treasure can also be particularly useful in horror adventures, both in revealing more of the plot and in unnerving the PCs. A GM can customize treasure to her adventure's needs. There should rarely be just a&nbsp;<em>+1 dagger&nbsp;</em>lying around in a horror adventure. Rather, that&nbsp;<em>+1 dagger&nbsp;</em>could bear the symbol of the city watch and the letters \"J. B.,\" the initials of the guard who disappeared after claiming he saw spiders drag a dog into the sewers. Even when an encounter just calls for a heap of coins and mundane supplies, don't hesitate to slip in letters, journals, or books the PCs can research to learn more about the plot (though try to avoid the adventure clich of including a bizarrely specific letter or unnecessary journal entry that directly reveals the story in an awkward and heavy-handed manner). Tidbits that make sense for that NPC and that the PCs can piece together contribute more to the air of mystery and horror. Evidence that the PCs aren't the first to face the horror can be rattling-especially if their predecessors failed-and can also serve as a reason for why magic items perfect for fighting a creature are in its lair. Additionally, rewards that act as a double-edged sword, such as a partially cursed item that provides just what the PCs need at a cost, often work better than cursed items that the PCs could just avoid as if they were other hazards. This gives the PCs the chance to dig their own graves and tempts them to keep the rewards around.</p>\n<p>Finally, a GM should know what success means for her adventure. PCs often assume that violence puts an end to things. For instance, they may think that killing the attic whisperer or setting the clock tower on fire destroys the fear. But fear and evil are notoriously resilient. Truly destroying the horror might require learning its origins or discovering its special weakness. If the attic whisperer continually arises from the ashes, eventually-with a little guidance-the PCs could discover that the creature's father is still alive, and might even be the priest who asked them to put an end to the lonely creature's menace. Of course, even then, it's difficult for the characters within a horror story to know whether an evil is truly exorcised-or merely lying in wait for a sequel.</p>"}

Chapter 1: Horror Characters}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In a game where terrible things lurk in the darkness and horrors crawl forth from nightmares to plague the living, the rules for fear are an important part of play. To help bring an appropriate atmosphere to the table, the following rules broaden the levels of fear and allow fear to have a greater impact on your character and the story.</p>\n<h1>LEVELS OF FEAR</h1>\n<p>The existing rules for fear offer three levels of fear, each one represented by a condition: shaken, frightened, and panicked. The following system expands the various states of fear into seven levels, divided into two groups (lesser fear and greater fear). The three levels of lesser fear-spooked, shaken, and scared-cause you to take penalties, but you are still ultimately in control. The four levels of greater fear- frightened, panicked, terrified, and horrified-cause you to progressively lose control of your character.</p>\n<p>When you are subject to a fear effect whose level exceeds your current fear level, your fear level increases to that level. If you are subject to a fear effect of a level equal to or lower than your current fear level, your fear level usually increases by one. However, multiple lesser fear effects can't force you to progress from a lesser fear level to a greater one. If you are scared and are subject to an additional lesser fear effect, you are staggered for 1 round, rather than becoming frightened. You can, however, accept the frightened condition rather than be staggered while scared if you prefer (such as if you actually want to run away).</p>\n<p>For example, Merisiel is exploring a haunted graveyard. Her GM declares she is spooked by her surroundings. She falls into a sinkhole filled with rotting corpses, which would also make her spooked. If she fails her Will save, her fear level increases to shaken. Later, after dealing with gruesome undead, she is scared and facing off against an evil cultist who casts <em>doom</em>, which causes the shaken condition, on her. If she fails her save against the spell, she is staggered for 1 round (rather than frightened), since shaken is a lesser fear effect.</p>\n<h2>Lesser Fear</h2>\n<p>Fear begins as a shiver down your spine, but soon grows.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Spooked</strong>: The nature of your surroundings or events that you have witnessed makes you uneasy. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws against fear effects and on Perception checks, as your mind conjures potential horrors in every shadow. However, you are ready to face danger, and gain a +1 circumstance bonus on initiative checks.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Shaken</strong>: Fear has taken hold of you and you are no longer thinking or acting clearly. You take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Scared</strong>: You are noticeably afraid, jumping at shadows and easily panicked by odd sights and unexplained noises. You take all of the penalties of the shaken condition, except the penalty on saves against fear effects becomes -4. In addition, if being subject to a lesser fear effect would increase your fear level, you are staggered for 1 round instead.</p>\n<h2>Greater Fear</h2>\n<p>At these levels, your fear begins to overwhelm you.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Frightened</strong>: You are so afraid that you must flee from the source of your fear. On your turn, you must move away from any source of fear you perceive. Once you can no longer perceive any source of fear, you can act as normal, but you still take all the penalties of the shaken condition. You can use special abilities, such as spells and equipment, to flee and must resort to such abilities if they seem like the only way to escape. If you flee from the source of your fear and it later reappears while you are still frightened, you must immediately begin fleeing again. If unable to flee, you can fight.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Panicked</strong>: This functions as the frightened condition, but you drop anything held whenever you are forced to flee and you flee in a random direction. In addition, you treat all sources of danger as fear sources and must flee from them as well. If unable to flee, you cower in fear.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Terrified</strong>: This functions as panicked, but you do not treat any other character as an ally and thus must attempt saving throws against spells that allow them, even if the spells are beneficial. If unable to flee, you cower in fear. In addition, once you have fled from fear, you do not act as normal. Instead, each round you roll on the following table to determine your course of action.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-tables.BAYcBVgoOqK5tB8w]{Horror Adventures: Panicked Rolltable}</p>\n<table style=\"height: 241px; width: 86.3576%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 6.99659%;\" colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\"><strong>d%</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 92.8328%;\" colspan=\"12\" scope=\"col\"><strong>Result</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 6.99659%;\" colspan=\"2\">1-25</td>\n<td style=\"width: 92.8328%;\" colspan=\"12\">Continue to flee, moving away from any known source of danger.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 6.99659%;\" colspan=\"2\">26-50</td>\n<td style=\"width: 92.8328%;\" colspan=\"12\">Find a place nearby to hide, using Stealth as normal. You do nothing until you are discovered (and forced to run again) or you are no longer terrified.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 6.99659%;\" colspan=\"2\">51-75</td>\n<td style=\"width: 92.8328%;\" colspan=\"12\">Lash out at the nearest creature, even an ally, attacking it with whatever weapon is available.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 6.99659%;\" colspan=\"2\">76-100</td>\n<td style=\"width: 92.8328%;\" colspan=\"12\">Do nothing. If you get this result in two consecutive rounds, you no longer need to roll on this chart starting on the third round and can act as normal unless you encounter a source of fear or danger, in which case you are still terrified and act accordingly.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>7. Horrified</strong>: You are transfixed with fear and can take no actions. You take a -2 penalty to your AC, are flat-footed (even if you normally cannot be), and are considered helpless.</p>\n<h2>Fear Duration</h2>\n<p>Using this system can make the tracking of your overall fear level a bit more complicated. Track each fear effect separately, evaluating your current fear level whenever an effect is added or removed, starting with the most severe effect and adding levels on top of that for each new effect. Remember that lesser fear effects cannot add up to a greater fear effect, regardless of their number, and the staggered condition that can result from being scared and then suffering another lesser fear effect applies at the moment when the new fear effect begins (not when it expires).</p>\n<p>For example, Ezren becomes subject to an effect that causes him to be shaken for 1 minute and another that causes him to be panicked for 1 round. On the 1st round, his fear increases to panicked. On the following 9 rounds, he is shaken. If, on the 3rd round, he becomes spooked for 1 minute, he becomes scared for 7 rounds (the overlap between the spooked condition and the remaining rounds of the shaken condition), then spooked for 3 rounds.</p>\n<h2>Fear Immunity</h2>\n<p>A number of creatures and characters are immune to fear. While that is fine for most fantasy adventure campaigns, it can prove problematic for horror-themed campaigns. GMs running such games should consider changing fear immunity to a form of resistance. Creatures and characters with fear resistance track their fear levels as normal, but they take the penalties of the fear level two steps lower than their actual level (thus, they suffer no effect at all unless they are at least scared). Furthermore, effects that normally cause a character to become spooked or shaken don't increase such a character's fear to a higher level.</p>\n<h2>Adding Fear</h2>\n<p>This revised fear system is meant to work seamlessly with the existing rules for fear, so GMs should use this system as an opportunity to add new fear effects to their games, including those derived from the environment and various situations. For example, entering an abandoned asylum during a moonless night might cause all the characters to gain the spooked condition, while discovering a cabinet filled with gnawed bones might cause a character to become scared for 1 minute after a failing a Will save. GMs not using this system should use the next-lower condition from the <em>Core Rulebook </em>if one of the new conditions appears, so anything that would normally inflict the spooked condition has no effect, scared becomes shaken, and terrified or horrified become panicked.</p>"}

Chapter 8: Bestiary}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can apply these simple templates to monsters for a quick way to inject an atmosphere of horror into your game. This section includes simple templates related to the corruption rules in Chapter 1, along with a simple template for creating fleshwarped creatures.</p>\n<h1>SIMPLE CORRUPTION TEMPLATES</h1>\n<p>PCs aren't the only ones who can carry the stain of corruption on their souls. However, the corruption rules were designed with PCs in mind, so they include numerous choices and progress over time. For a creature that appears in a single encounter, it makes more sense to grant it a simple package of abilities that captures the feel of the corruption. This allows you to create all sorts of custom monsters on the fly, inspired by the themes of the corruptions. Looking for a mount for a ghoul NPC? Add the ghoulish creature simple template to a horse (or other mount of your choice), and you're good to go!</p>\n<p>Corruption simple templates function the same way as other simple templates. All simple templates have two categories of changes. The quick rules present a faster way to modify a creature's abilities without actually changing the creature's ability scores and propagating those changes. The rebuild rules list the exact changes to make to the base creature's abilities, including ability scores, if you have the capacity to completely rebuild it. These two methods result in creatures with similar abilities (though the quick rules will be missing some of the more obscure interactions of increasing an ability score). Some of these simple templates (lich creature, lycanthropic creature, and vampiric creature) are simplified versions of lengthier templates found in <em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em>. A hellbound creature has the weakness of a devilbound creature (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 </em>56), and a hive creature has the hive subtype (see page 233). Abilities from these longer templates or the hive subtype are denoted with an asterisk (*). The simple template indicates any differences to the original template's abilities.</p>\n<h1>Accursed Creature (CR +1)</h1>\n<p>An accursed creature suffers under a powerful curse and can spread a spiteful curse of its own to others. Choose a thematic curse that you can convey to the players, but don't change the creature's statistics. You can use the curses from page 138 or from page 556 of the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook </em>as inspiration.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick Rules</strong>: Two claw attacks that deal 1d4 points of damage (for Medium creatures); natural attacks cause <em>bestow curse </em>(DC = 10 + 1/2 creature's HD + creature's Cha modifier, CL = creature's HD) on a successful hit (this can inflict any effect of <em>bestow curse </em>or spread the creature's personal curse).</p>\n<p><strong>Rebuild Rules</strong>: <strong>Melee </strong>two claw attacks that each deal 1d4 points of damage (for Medium creatures); <strong>Special Attacks </strong>natural attacks cause <em>bestow curse </em>(DC = 10 + 1/2 creature's HD + creature's Cha modifier, CL = creature's HD) on a successful hit (this can inflict any effect of <em>bestow curse </em>or spread the creature's personal curse); <strong>Special Qualities </strong>the creature is under a particular curse.</p>\n<h1>Deep Creature (CR +1)</h1>\n<p>Deep creatures have been twisted by the deep ones, whether through interbreeding or foul rituals.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick Rules</strong>: +8 on Swim checks and can always take 10 on Swim checks; swim speed equal to base land speed; +1 to AC; +1 on rolls based on Con or Wis; +1 hp/HD; two claw attacks that each deal 1d4 points of damage (for Medium creatures); amphibious.</p>\n<p><strong>Rebuild Rules</strong>: <strong>Type </strong>gain the aquatic and deep one subtypes; <strong>AC </strong>natural armor increases by 1; <strong>Speed </strong>swim speed equal to base land speed; <strong>Melee </strong>two claw attacks that each deal 1d4 points of damage (for Medium creatures); <strong>Special Qualities </strong>amphibious; <strong>Ability Scores </strong>+2 Str, +2 Con, +2 Wis.</p>\n<h1>Ghoulish Creature (CR +1)</h1>\n<p>Ghoulish creatures have succumbed to ghoul fever and transformed into cannibalistic undead versions of their previous selves.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick Rules</strong>: Counts as undead; darkvision 60 ft.; undead immunities; +1 to AC; +1 on rolls based on Str and Cha; two claw attacks that deal each 1d4 points of damage (for Medium creatures) plus paralysis and one bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (for Medium creatures) plus paralysis and disease; disease (<em>Ghoul Fever</em>: Bite-injury; <em>save </em>Fort DC = 10 + 1/2 HD + Cha modifier; <em>onset </em>1 day; <em>frequency </em>1/day; <em>effect </em>1d3 points of Con damage and 1d3 points of Dex damage; <em>cure </em>2 consecutive saves); paralysis (1d4+1 rounds, DC = 10 + 1/2 HD + Cha modifier, elves are immune).</p>\n<p><strong>Rebuild Rules</strong>: <strong>Type </strong>change to undead; <strong>Senses </strong>darkvision 60 ft.; <strong>AC </strong>natural armor bonus increases by 1; <strong>Melee </strong>two claw attacks that each deal 1d4 points of damage (for Medium creatures) plus paralysis and one bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (for Medium creatures) plus paralysis and disease; <strong>Special Attacks </strong>disease (<em>Ghoul Fever</em>: Bite-injury; <em>save </em>Fort DC = 10 + 1/2 HD + Cha modifier; <em>onset </em>1 day; <em>frequency </em>1/day; <em>effect </em>1d3 Con and 1d3 Dex damage; <em>cure </em>2 consecutive saves), paralysis (1d4+1 rounds, DC = 10 + 1/2 HD + Cha modifier, elves are immune); <strong>Ability Scores </strong>+2 Str, +2 Cha.</p>\n<h1>Hellbound Creature (CR +1)</h1>\n<p>Hellbound creatures have consigned their souls to Hell in exchange for infernal power. A hellbound creature's Hit Dice determine what type of devil it can summon with its summon spell-like ability and the summon ability's spell level. It can instead choose to summon 1d3 devils of the next weaker category, or 1d4+1 devils of two categories weaker.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick Rules</strong>: Darkvision; see in darkness; +1 to AC; +1 on rolls based on Str and Cha; contract bound*; gore attack that deals 1d4 points of damage (for Medium creatures); summon (see table; 100%).</p>\n<p><strong>Rebuild Rules</strong>: <strong>Senses </strong>darkvision, see in darkness; <strong>AC </strong>natural armor bonus increases by 1; <strong>Weaknesses </strong>contract bound*; <strong>Melee </strong>gore attack that deals 1d4 points of damage (for Medium creatures); <strong>Spell-like Abilities </strong>summon (see table; 100%); <strong>Ability Scores </strong>+2 Str, +2 Cha.</p>\n<h1>Hellbound Summon</h1>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Hellbound Creature HD</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Devil</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Spell Level</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8 or fewer</td>\n<td>Lemure</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9-10</td>\n<td>Bearded devil</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11-12</td>\n<td>Erinyes</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13-14</td>\n<td>Bone devil</td>\n<td>7th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15-16</td>\n<td>Barbed devil</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17 or more</td>\n<td>Ice devil</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1>Hive Creature (CR +1)</h1>\n<p>While a creature infested by a hive corruption usually becomes a warrior, mutations can create hive creatures that retain the capabilities of the original creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick Rules</strong>: +3 to AC; +1 on rolls based on Str, Dex, and Con; -3 on rolls based on Cha; +1 hp/ HD; two claw attacks that each deal 1d4 points of damage (for Medium creatures) and one bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (for Medium creatures); immunity to acid; blind; blindsense 60 ft.; blindsight 10 ft.; corrosive blood*; hive mind*.</p>\n<p><strong>Rebuild Rules</strong>: <strong>Type </strong>gain the hive subtype and all the corresponding abilities; <strong>AC </strong>natural armor bonus increases by 2; <strong>Melee </strong>two claw attacks that each deal 1d4 points of damage (for Medium creatures) and one bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (for Medium creatures); <strong>Ability Scores </strong>+2 Str, +2 Dex, +2 Con, -6 Cha.</p>\n<h1>Lich Creature (CR +1)</h1>\n<p>While it might not have followed the traditional path to lichdom, which requires a strong aptitude for magic, a lich creature's connection to an object allows it to survive as an undead indefinitely, returning each time its foes destroy it unless they can destroy the lich creature's phylactery (<em>Bestiary </em>188).</p>\n<p><strong>Quick Rules</strong>: Counts as undead; darkvision 60 ft.; rejuvenation*; immune to cold and electricity; undead immunities; +1 on rolls based on Int, Wis, and Cha; touch attack deals 1d8 + 1/2 HD points of damage plus paralyzing touch*; fear aura*.</p>\n<p><strong>Rebuild Rules</strong>: <strong>Type </strong>change to undead; <strong>Senses </strong>darkvision 60 ft.; <strong>Defensive Abilities </strong>rejuvenation*; <strong>Immune </strong>cold, electricity; <strong>Melee </strong>touch attack deals 1d8 + 1/2 HD points of damage plus paralyzing touch*; <strong>Special Attacks </strong>fear aura*, paralyzing touch*; <strong>Ability Scores </strong>+2 Int, +2 Wis, +2 Cha.</p>\n<h1>Lycanthropic Creature (CR +1)</h1>\n<p>Lycanthropic creatures can act as simpler variants of any sort of lycanthrope in hybrid form, but the default is for a werewolf-like creature, so if the base lycanthrope has different features, adjust the creature accordingly (for instance, a wereshark can swim). This simple template reflects the creature's hybrid form. The creature can't take full animal form, and when it's in its ordinary form, remove this template with the exceptions of change shape, low-light vision, and scent. Lycanthropic creatures don't have to be humanoids, and at your discretion, a lycanthropic creature can afflict creatures of its own type with lycanthropy, in addition to humanoids.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick Rules</strong>: +1 to AC; <strong>DR </strong>5/silver; +1 on rolls based on Str, Dex, and Con; +1 hp/HD; bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (for Medium creatures) plus curse of lycanthropy*; change shape (normal or hybrid form; <em>polymorph</em>); lycanthropic empathy* (as appropriate for the lycanthrope).</p>\n<p><strong>Rebuild Rules</strong>: <strong>Type </strong>gain the shapechanger subtype; <strong>DR </strong>5/ silver; <strong>Senses </strong>low-light vision, scent; <strong>AC </strong>natural armor bonus increases by 1; <strong>Melee </strong>bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (for Medium creatures) plus curse of lycanthropy*; <strong>Special Attacks </strong>curse of lycanthropy*; <strong>Special Attacks </strong>change shape (normal or hybrid form; <em>polymorph</em>), lycanthropic empathy* (as appropriate for the lycanthrope); <strong>Ability Scores </strong>+2 Str, +2 Dex, +2 Con.</p>\n<h1>Possessed Creature (CR +1)</h1>\n<p>While there are rules in <em>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures </em>for when a creature is possessed and totally controlled by a specific spell, sometimes a creature is possessed by a vague entity (hereafter called a spirit) that acts as a second personality within the creature's mind, sharing control and providing the creature some symbiotic benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick Rules</strong>: +2 on rolls based on Cha; +4 on Will saves; after failing a save against a mind-affecting effect, reroll the save, but the spirit takes control if the second save succeeds; always acts on the surprise round.</p>\n<p><strong>Rebuild Rules</strong>: <strong>Defensive Abilities </strong>+4 on Will saves; after failing a save against a mind-affecting effect, reroll the save, but the spirit takes control if the second save succeeds; <strong>Special Qualities </strong>always acts on the surprise round; <strong>Ability Scores </strong>+4 Cha.</p>\n<h1>Promethean Creature (CR +1)</h1>\n<p>A promethean creature has had some of its body replaced by golem parts.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick Rules</strong>: +4 to AC; +2 on rolls based on Str; slam attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (for Medium creatures); +4 on saving throws vs. poison and disease; immune to emotion(UM) effects except those that produce rage, hatred, or anger; automatically stabilize when below 0 hp.</p>\n<p><strong>Rebuild Rules</strong>: <strong>AC </strong>natural armor bonus increases by 4; <strong>Defensive Abilities </strong>+4 on saving throws vs. poison and disease, immune to emotion(UM) effects except those that produce rage, hatred, or anger; automatically stabilize when below 0 hp; <strong>Melee </strong>slam attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (for Medium creatures); <strong>Special Qualities </strong>doesn't need to eat, sleep, or drink; <strong>Ability Scores </strong>+4 Str.</p>\n<h1>Shadowbound Creature (CR +1)</h1>\n<p>A shadowbound creature has lost its color and capacity for joy and pleasure.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick Rules</strong>: darkvision 120 ft.; +1 to AC; +2 on rolls based on Con; +2 hp/HD; light blindness; can't gain morale bonuses; regretful gaze (shaken 1 round, 30 ft., Will save negates, DC = 10 + 1/2 HD + Cha modifier); after taking 3 points of damage per HD in a single attack, gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Rebuild Rules</strong>: <strong>Senses </strong>darkvision 120 ft.; <strong>AC </strong>gain a deflection bonus to AC equal to 1/4 CR (minimum 1); <strong>Weaknesses </strong>light blindness, can't gain morale bonuses; <strong>Special Attacks </strong>regretful gaze (shaken 1 round, 30 ft., Will negates, DC = 10 + 1/2 HD + Cha modifier); after taking 3 points of damage per HD in a single attack, gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 round; <strong>Ability Scores </strong>+4 Con.</p>\n<h1>Vampiric Creature (CR +1)</h1>\n<p>Vampiric creatures have been transformed into vampires, and they don't have to be humanoids. At your discretion, a vampiric creature might have the create spawn ability and could create spawn of its own creature type in addition to humanoid spawn. Non-humanoid vampiric creatures likely have unusual \"coffins\" that befit their nature.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick Rules</strong>: Counts as undead; darkvision 60 ft.; +1 to AC; +1 on rolls based on Str, Dex, and Cha; undead immunities; fast healing 1* (this includes the ability to escape to its coffin in gaseous form at 0 hp); vampire weaknesses*; slam attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (for Medium creatures) plus energy drain; blood drain*; energy drain (1 level, DC = 10 + 1/2 HD + Charisma modifier); gaseous form*, shadowless*, spider climb*.</p>\n<p><strong>Rebuild Rules</strong>: <strong>Type </strong>change to undead; <strong>Senses </strong>darkvision 60 ft.; <strong>AC </strong>natural armor bonus increases by 1; <strong>Defensive Abilities </strong>fast healing 1* (this includes the ability to escape to its coffin in gaseous form at 0 hp); <strong>Weaknesses </strong>vampire weaknesses*; <strong>Melee </strong>slam attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (for Medium creatures) plus energy drain; <strong>Special Attacks </strong>blood drain*, energy drain (1 level, DC = 10 + 1/2 HD + Charisma modifier); <strong>Special Qualities </strong>gaseous form*, shadowless*, spider climb*; <strong>Ability Scores </strong>+2 Str, +2 Dex, +2 Cha.</p>\n<h1>FLESHWARPED CREATURE</h1>\n<p>The process of altering creatures or creating new types of monsters through fleshwarping can be very involved. To quickly create a creature transformed by fleshwarping, use the simple template below. The full rules for fleshwarping appear on pages 164-171.</p>\n<h1>Fleshwarped Creature (CR +1)</h1>\n<p>These creatures are twisted by fleshwarping, grants horrific abilities by perverting creatures' original forms. This template can be applied only to corporeal living creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick Rules</strong>: +2 to AC and CMD; +2 to attack rolls and damage rolls; +2 hp/HD; +2 on rolls based on Str and Dex; -2 on rolls based on Int and Cha; the creature gains a new movement mode (climb, burrow, fly [clumsy], or swim) with a speed of 30 ft.</p>\n<p><strong>Rebuild Rules</strong>: <strong>AC </strong>increase natural armor bonus by 2; <strong>Movement </strong>The creature gains a movement new movement mode (climb, burrow, fly [clumsy], or swim) with a speed of 30 ft.; <strong>Ability Scores </strong>+4 Str, +4 Con, -4 Int, -4 Cha.</p>\n<h1>VARIANT TEMPLATES</h1>\n<p>The following variant templates alter previous templates, similarly to the way archetypes alter character classes.</p>\n<h1>Bestial Werewolf</h1>\n<p>Bestial werewolves do not transform into normal wolves or wolf-human hybrids, but instead transform into oversized, monstrous wolves.</p>\n<p>In addition to the changes for the lycanthrope template, make the following adjustments to the base creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Rating</strong>: Normal werewolf 's CR + 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities</strong>: Regardless of whether it is natural or afflicted, a bestial werewolf gains DR 10/silver and ferocity when in animal form.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks</strong>: A bestial werewolf does not gain the change shape special attack of the lycanthrope template, and instead gains the following special attacks.</p>\n<p><em>Change Shape (Su)</em>: A bestial werewolf does not gain a hybrid form, and its animal form is that of a dire wolf, rather than an ordinary wolf. Otherwise, this ability functions identically to the change shape ability granted by the lycanthrope template.</p>\n<p><em>Feral Counter (Ex)</em>: While in animal form, the first time each round that a creature damages a bestial werewolf, the bestial werewolf can take an attack of opportunity against the creature. The werewolf must threaten the triggering creature to use this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Scores</strong>: A bestial werewolf gains +4 Strength and +4 Constitution in animal form, instead of the normal statistic adjustments granted by the lycanthrope template.</p>\n<h1>Familial Lich</h1>\n<p>A familial lich does not have a physical body or standard phylactery. Instead, it possesses its own kin.</p>\n<p>In addition to the changes for the lich template, make the following adjustments to the base creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities</strong>: A familial lich gains DR 10/good instead of DR 15/bludgeoning and magic, and loses its rejuvenation ability, but gains an amount of spell resistance equal to 11 + its CR, and the following defensive ability.</p>\n<p><em>Familial Possession (Su)</em>: When a familial lich is destroyed, its spirit departs its body and seeks out the lich's nearest living relative, a process that takes 1d10 days. The familial lich then tries to possess the relative, as per <em>greater possession</em>(OA) (the caster level is equal to the familial lich's HD, and the save DC is Charisma-based). If the relative succeeds at her save, she becomes permanently immune to this ability, and the familial lich must spend another 1d10 days searching for the next-nearest living relative, repeating the process until it succeeds or until no such relatives remain and it is destroyed instead.</p>\n<p>If the relative fails her saving throw, the familial lich's spirit takes root in her body. The familial lich's consciousness remains within the relative even after the <em>greater possession </em>effect ends, and it is able to share her senses. It can use <em>greater possession </em>on her once per day thereafter. If the relative fails on three consecutive saving throws to resist, the familial lich's spirit takes over, and she physically and mentally transforms into the familial lich permanently. Even if the relative continues succeeding, it is impossible to remove a familial lich without extremely powerful magic once it has taken root.</p>\n<p>Only lineal ancestors or descendants of the familial lich, as well as siblings, are eligible targets for possession (aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, and so forth are immune).</p>\n<h1>Moonbound Werewolf</h1>\n<p>A moonbound werewolf 's lycanthropy is closely linked to the cycles of the moon.</p>\n<p>In addition to the changes for the lycanthrope template, make the following adjustments to the base creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Rating</strong>: Same as a normal werewolf (however, depending on the cycle of the moon, the CR of an encounter with a moonbound werewolf can shift up or down by 1).</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities</strong>: Regardless of whether it is a natural or afflicted lycanthrope, a moonbound werewolf gains DR 5/silver in animal or hybrid form. When the moon is near full, this increases to DR 10/silver; when the moon is full, it increases to DR 10/silver and magic; and when the moon is new, the moonbound werewolf loses this damage reduction.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Qualities</strong>: A moonbound werewolf gains the following special quality.</p>\n<p><em>Moonbound (Su)</em>: A moonbound werewolf gains benefits and drawbacks based on the current phase of the moon. For the purposes of this ability, the moon is in one of four phases at any given time: full, nearly full, new, and other.

Chapter 1: Horror Characters}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Darkness and fear are all that guide you. As the shadow consumes you, you are becoming a gaunt caricature of your former self, emptied of life and color.</p>\n<h1>CATALYST</h1>\n<p>Shadowbound corruption occurs after a month or more of exposure to the Shadow Plane or shadow magic, or contact with cruel kytons, aberrations, undead, or shadowy fey. Corruption sets in only if it is used to torment or disillusion you at least six times in a month in a deeply personal manner.</p>\n<h1>Progression</h1>\n<p>The corruption progresses when you're tortured by shadow again, when you destroy a thing of beauty or joy because your melancholy makes it unbearable, or when you sow fear. Every month you must spend at least 2 entire days per manifestation level you have away from all light and other life. If you don't, at the end of the month you must attempt a Will saving throw. If you fail, sometime in the next 24 hours you go berserk and destroy something precious. You also need to attempt such a saving throw the first time each day you come across a being or object of great beauty, or a being or object with a strong or overwhelming aura of good (this includes yourself, so to avoid the save, you might need to ruin or tarnish your own beauty). The save DC is equal to 15 + your manifestation level. If allies are able to restrain you for 24 hours or otherwise prevent you from destroying anything precious during that time, your corruption doesn't progress.</p>\n<p>However, the DC of the Will save to prevent your corruption from progressing increases by 2. These increases stack each time this occurs, and they last until your corruption reaches the next corruption stage.</p>\n<p>The precious thing you destroy when you fail your save depends on your corruption stage, as noted below. If you voluntarily destroy a being or object related to a later corruption stage, you automatically progress to that stage (you might skip over intervening stages in this manner). For example, the first time that you intentionally terrorize innocents or destroy an important object of beauty, you then immediately proceed to stage 2. Repeating your actions doesn't cause your corruption stage to progress further (if you terrorize innocents again, you don't progress to stage 3).</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 1</strong>: The first time you fail the saving throw, you destroy a reliable source of light, joy, or beauty, such as a piece of art or bit of natural beauty.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 2</strong>: The second time you fail the saving throw, you terrorize innocent people or destroy an important object of beauty, light, or joy.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 3</strong>: The third time you fail the saving throw, you destroy one of the pillars that has helped you retain yourself in the face of the corruption, either by killing someone whose support has been essential or destroying an object of vital personal importance. You lose your identity entirely, becoming an NPC under the GM's control.</p>\n<h1>Removing the Corruption</h1>\n<p>Undoing the corruption requires destroying the creature who first twisted you or restoring all the hope and joy that have fallen into darkness as a result of your corruption.</p>\n<h1>MANIFESTATIONS</h1>\n<p>The following are manifestations of this corruption.</p>\n<h1>Eerie Perception</h1>\n<p>Your eyes change, adapting to a life in the shadows.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, the range of your darkvision increases by 30 feet instead. You also gain a +2 bonus on Perception and Stealth checks. At manifestation level 3rd, the bonuses increase to +4.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Your eye color fades to a dull gray and your eyes overreact to light. You gain light sensitivity, causing you to be dazzled in areas of bright light.</p>\n<h1>Emptiness of the Void</h1>\n<p>Friends and allies are just people you can hurt more deeply.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: The darkness in your soul can draw in the life force of allies. Once per day when you take ability damage, ability drain, or hit point damage, you can divide the damage or drain evenly between you and one ally within 30 feet. You can do so only if the damage or drain would reduce your ability score or hit points to 0. The ally can attempt a Will save to resist the link. You can activate this ability as a free action, even if it isn't your turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You struggle to remember the meaning of alliance and friendship. You can't benefit from or use the aid another action.</p>\n<h1>Frightful</h1>\n<p>Fear lingers in your mind, and you can spread it to others.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You have a knack for guessing just how to scare others. You gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks and the DCs of fear effects you create increase by 1. At manifestation level 3rd, the bonus on Intimidate checks increases to +4 and the DC increases by 2 instead of 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Your hair loses its color and your sleep is interrupted by nightmares that never leave your mind. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws against fear effects, and you lose any immunities to fear you might otherwise possess. You gain immunity to effects that would remove your fear (such as <em>remove fear</em>). At manifestation level 3rd, the penalty changes to -4.</p>\n<h1>Insubstantiality</h1>\n<p>Your body flickers occasionally into insubstantial shadow.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Manifestation level 3rd.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Your body sometimes shifts or blurs momentarily before resuming the appearance of solidity. You gain a deflection bonus to your AC equal to half your manifestation level. You have a 20% chance to ignore (treat as a normal hit) confirmed critical hits and precision-based damage (such as sneak attack damage) from any weapon unless it has the <em>ghost touch </em>weapon special ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You take a -6 penalty on saving throws and to your CMD against attacks and effects that would move or trip you, as well as on all combat maneuver checks except those made to escape a grapple.</p>\n<h1>Refuge in Pain</h1>\n<p>Pain is your only solace from the emptiness of your existence.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 4th, eerie perception*, wretched pain*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Pain invigorates you. Whenever you take an amount of damage greater than or equal to three times your character level from a single attack, you gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 round. If you have the stain from the weaver of lies manifestation, these bonuses are profane bonuses instead. <strong>Stain</strong>: Whenever you take damage, increase the amount of damage you take by 1/2 your manifestation level.</p>\n<h1>Regretful Gaze</h1>\n<p>Your gaze carries your regret for wasted potential.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 3rd, frightful*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain a gaze attack that causes foes within 30 feet to become shaken for 1 round unless they succeed at a Will save. You can suppress this ability as a free action and cause it to resume as a swift action. A creature that succeeds at the saving throw is immune to your regretful gaze for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You are withered as if by age. Reduce your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores by 1 point each, or by however much they would be reduced if you were one age category older, whichever is worse for you.</p>\n<h1>Touch of Ruin</h1>\n<p>You are infused with the ruin of the Shadow Plane.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 4th, frightful*, regretful gaze*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: As a standard action a number of times per day equal to your manifestation level, you can make a melee touch attack that deals 1d10 points of damage per manifestation level you have. A creature touched this way takes 1 point of ability drain to the ability score of your choice unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this touch attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Any clothing or gear you wear or carry seems strangely faded and timeworn as long as you wear or carry it. Treat such items' hardness as half the normal amount. You take a -4 penalty on saving throws to protect items in your possession from damage or destruction.</p>\n<h1>Weaver of Lies</h1>\n<p>Using shadows drawn from the Plane of Shadow, you can spin falsehoods into convincing imitations of reality.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Manifestation level 2nd.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Once per day, you can use <em>shadow conjuration </em>as a spell-like ability, but only to emulate a sorcerer/wizard spell 1 spell level lower than your manifestation level. Your caster level is equal to your character level. The illusion is 10% real + another 10% real for every manifestation level you have beyond 2nd.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Joy and excitement have become foreign to you, leaving pain the only sensation of much interest. You can't benefit from morale bonuses or bardic performances.</p>\n<h1>Wretched Pain</h1>\n<p>Inflicting pain is one of the few sensations that still stirs you.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Eerie perception*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Whenever you deal weapon damage to a creature that you are flanking or a creature that is denied its Dexterity bonus to its AC against you, you can inflict a painful wound as an immediate action. The target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be nauseated by pain for 1 round. If the target succeeds at the save, it is sickened for 1 round and becomes immune to your further uses of this ability for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Your eyes turn a milky white, utter black, or pale yellow, making you appear blind although you can see normally in most circumstances. You gain light blindness, causing you to be blinded for 1 round whenever you are exposed to daylight or another source of bright light and dazzled for as long as you remain in bright light thereafter.</p>"}

When it does so, a portion of the swarm enters a creature's mouth and gestates for 1d4 minutes. The gestated larvae ravage the host for 24 hours, during which time the infested creature falls unconscious and can't be woken by any means. During this period the larvae are vulnerable to expulsion by <em>remove disease </em>(same DC as death throes, typically DC 16). If successful, the hive larvae die inside of the host, dealing another 1d6 points of acid damage. In some cases, metabolized hive larvae corpses can infect the creature with the hive corruption (see page 24).</p>\n<p>After 24 hours, the hive larvae achieve symbiosis. The host awakens feeling healthy but hungry. Spells such as <em>diagnose disease</em>(UM) and Heal checks used to detect disease no longer detect the hive infestation, and the host creature is now treated as both its original creature type and an aberration for purposes of spells and effects (whichever is worse). A successful DC 25 Knowledge (dungeoneering) check can identify the symbiosis. If the host dies at this point, the larval infestation dies as well. However, if the host is then returned from the dead, the larvae are returned to life as well.</p>\n<p>The swarm fully matures 2d12 hours after symbiosis. By this point, there is no way to save the host short of a <em>miracle </em>or <em>wish </em>spell. Each round for 2d12 rounds, the host suffers agonizing pain and must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 16) or be nauseated for 1 round. On each failed save, the host takes 4d6 points of damage as the mature hive creature forcibly separates itself. At the end of the 2d12 rounds, or after the host is slain by the damage, a fully formed hive creature (usually a hive warrior) explodes from within, destroying the host's body.</p>\n<p><strong>Poison (Ex) </strong>Swarm-injury; <em>save </em>Fort DC 16; <em>frequency </em>1/round for 6 rounds; <em>effect </em>1d4 Strength; <em>cure </em>2 consecutive saves.</p>\n<p>Hive larvae are the first stage of the hive life cycle.

Creatures struck by this spray take acid damage as if struck by a hive creature's death throes. Additionally, creatures damaged by a hive warrior's acid spit continue to take the same amount of acid damage for the next 1d3 rounds. A successful Reflex save halves the initial damage and negates the ongoing damage. The save DC is Dexterity-based.</p>\n<p><strong>Rending Mandibles (Ex) </strong>When a hive warrior confirms a critical hit with its bite, it deals equal damage to the creature's armor.</p>\n<p>Hive warriors guard colonies and serve as scouts for suitable hosts. Warriors sometimes range miles from their colony and drag victims back to be cocooned by hive workers. Hive warriors consider symbiosis with a hive creature to be both inevitable and beneficial and can't fathom why most victims struggle against it. Hive workers have similar statistics, though they have the ability to secrete resin and sculpt that resin, rather than acid spit or rending mandibles.</p>\n<p>^Bestiary Horrific Inspirations</p>"}

The application of the powder depends on the disease from which it is refined. Someone using powder made from diseases contracted by ingestion must apply it to food (a full-round action) for the victim to consume. Those using powder made from diseases contracted by injury must apply the powder to weapons (a standard action, as per the poison application rules) and deal damage to victims to subject them to the contagion. Diseases contracted by inhalation require the user to disperse the powder by throwing it into the air. Throwing a handful of plague powder is a splash attack with a range increment of 5 feet. Anyone standing in the square of impact must succeed at a save with a DC equal to that of the disease from which the powder is made to avoid contracting the illness, while those in adjacent squares must attempt the same save with a +4 bonus. Diseases spread through contact can use any of the three manners of application.</p>\n<p>The most common disease refined for these powders is filth fever, costing 144 gp, but refined plague powders of other diseases are available, with a price equal to the base save DC of the disease squared. Making a plague powder always requires access to a sample of the disease and exposes the creator to the disease in question each day of crafting. Crafting a dose of plague powder requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check.</p>\n<h1>Reanimated Fluid</h1>\n<p><strong>PRICE</strong> 100 GP; <strong>WEIGHT</strong> -</p>\n<p>This viscous, translucent green fluid is typically stored in a large syringe. When injected into a mostly intact corpse of a Medium or smaller creature that has been dead for no more than 1 day (time spent under effects like <em>gentle repose </em>don't count against this time), the fluid gives the corpse a rudimentary semblance of life,</p>\n<p>reactivating its nerves and muscle tissue. This causes the corpse to reanimate and shamble around erratically for 1 minute. The result is not an undead creature, nor is it a construct. The reanimated corpse remains utterly lifeless and is driven only by muscular spasms that cause it shuffle 20 feet in a random direction each round, gasping and blinking eerily as it goes. When the corpse hits a solid barrier or is attacked, it stops moving. On its next turn, roll 1d8 to determine where it goes next. On a 1, it continues forward in the same direction it had been previously moving (or runs up against the same barrier). On a 2, it turns 45 clockwise and heads in that direction; on a 3, it turns 90 clockwise and heads in that direction; and so on. The corpse can't attack, doesn't defend itself, and-as an object-has AC 10 and 12 hit points. Crafting a syringe of reanimating fluid requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check.</p>\n<p>^Horror Gear and Magic Items Bestiary</p>"}

Chapter 1: Horror Characters}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your attempt to transition into unlife has gone horribly awry and your soul is trapped. Lich corruption also works for becoming another sort of corporeal undead (except ghouls and vampires, which have their own corruptions).</p>\n<h1>CATALYST</h1>\n<p>This corruption originates from an unsuccessful attempt at lichdom. You might have lacked sufficient power or used a flawed phylactery. If you're not a spellcaster, you could have been an innocent bystander or become corrupted upon destroying a particularly powerful lich's phylactery.</p>\n<h1>Progression</h1>\n<p>Lich corruptions are rarely stable, and cause incredible mental and physical strain. Whenever you fail a saving throw against a necromancy effect, learn how to cast a new spell or spells, or are exposed to 25 points of negative energy damage or more from a single source (whether it heals or harms you), you must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 15 + your manifestation level) or become spiritually disjoined. You also need to make a saving throw whenever anyone successfully casts the <em>death ward </em>spell on you. After a failed save, your spirit and body disconnect, leaving your corporeal form helpless and your mind trapped within the Negative Energy Plane. This state lasts for 1 hour per manifestation level; if you are killed during this time, you rise 24 hours later as a wraith under the GM's control.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 1</strong>: The first time you recover from this disconnected state, you return diminished, taking a permanent -2 penalty to your Charisma score, and your alignment shifts one step toward evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 2</strong>: The second time this happens, your alignment shifts another step toward evil and you take an additional -2 penalty to your Charisma score.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 3</strong>: The third time this happens, you die and your soul is consumed by the Negative Energy Plane. You can't be raised or resurrected except by powerful magic such as <em>miracle </em>or <em>wish</em>. Even if you do get brought back, you are an evil lich NPC under the GM's control.</p>\n<h1>Removing the Corruption</h1>\n<p>Curing lich corruption requires great acts of purification, such as being exorcised by a powerful cleric, bathing in sacred springs, or creating a phylactery of your own into which to expel the lich corruption.</p>\n<h1>MANIFESTATIONS</h1>\n<p>The following are manifestations of the lich corruption.</p>\n<h1>Agonizing Touch</h1>\n<p>Your touch racks the living with pain.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 4th, death's caress*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Once per day per manifestation level, you can make an agonizing touch as a standard action. A living creature hit by this touch attack must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your manifestation level.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Both of your hands wither to nearly skeletal appendages, and your emotions dim towards the coldness of undeath. You take a -2 penalty on attacks with manufactured weapons. Your spells with somatic or emotion (<em>Occult Adventures </em>144) components have a 5% failure chance. This stacks with any spell failure chances you incur from other sources.</p>\n<h1>Bleak aura</h1>\n<p>Entropy seeps from your body.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 4th, deathless*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Any living creature that ends its turn adjacent to you takes 1 point of negative energy damage for every 2 manifestation levels you have.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Animals are startled by your presence, worsening their starting attitudes toward you by one step. Any animal companion you have abandons you when you acquire this stain. Whispering voices fill the air around you, begging for release or cursing your existence. Any creature that succeeds at a DC 20 Perception check can hear these whispers, which might alert it to your presence if you're using Stealth.</p>\n<h1>Cadaver's Countenance</h1>\n<p>Your body takes on a deathly likeness.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain a +1 natural armor bonus to your AC and a +2 bonus on saves against mind-affecting effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Your flesh tightens, turning corpselike and gray as your body rots. You take a -2 penalty to your Constitution.</p>\n<h1>Deathless</h1>\n<p>You are inured to negative energy.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects that work only on living creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You are healed by negative energy and harmed by positive energy as if you were an undead creature.</p>\n<h1>Death's Caress</h1>\n<p>Your touch drains the warmth of life from others.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You can make a touch attack as a standard action that deals cold damage equal to 1d4 + your manifestation level.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: The flesh from one of your hands rots away, leaving it a blackened, skeletal claw. Spells that detect undead sense you, though the peculiar result they return informs the caster that you're still a living creature. Other spells and effects don't treat you as undead.</p>\n<h1>Greater Cadaver's Countenance</h1>\n<p>You become emaciated and nearly skeletal.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 4th, cadaver's countenance*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain cold resistance 5 and DR equal to 1/2 your manifestation level that is overcome by bludgeoning damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You take an additional -2 penalty to your Constitution score and are affected by spells and abilities (including <em>bane </em>and favored enemy) as if your creature type were undead. This doesn't grant you the immunities of undead creatures, nor does it make you immune to effects that target living creatures or change how negative and positive energy affect you.</p>\n<h1>Malevolence</h1>\n<p>You can wrench your soul from your body to possess another.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 7th, bleak aura*, deathless*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You can touch a living creature as a standard action and force your soul into its body. If hit by this touch attack, the target must succeed at a Will save (DC = 15 + your manifestation level) or be affected by <em>possession</em>(OA). You can possess creatures for a number of minutes per day equal to your manifestation level. These minutes don't need to be used consecutively, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. A failed attempt costs 1 minute of use and renders your target immune to your malevolence for 24 hours. Your body is helpless while you possess another creature, and if it is destroyed you die when the duration of malevolence ends. You can use malevolence while in another creature's body to transfer your soul again (following the same rules for casting <em>possession </em>while in a body that's not your own).</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Your spirit is untethered from your body. You roll twice and take the lowest result on saves against spells that imprison or target your soul, such as <em>magic jar </em>and <em>trap the soul</em>, as well as against positive energy effects. If you drop below 0 hit points, your soul leaves your body and you instantly die.</p>\n<h1>Master of the Dead</h1>\n<p>You can animate the dead with your necromantic power.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 6th, agonizing touch*, death's caress*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You can cast <em>animate dead </em>at will as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to your character level. You must provide the material components, and you take 2 points of Charisma drain for every creature you animate. If the drain is removed or you avoid taking it, the animated creature is immediately destroyed (you choose which creatures are destroyed if some but not all drain is removed). Conversely, the Charisma drain from animating a creature is instantly removed when that creature is destroyed. You still must abide by the usual Hit Die limits of <em>animate dead</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Your emotions are nearly a thing of the past. You can't benefit from morale bonuses or bardic performances.</p>\n<h1>Necromantic Knowledge</h1>\n<p>You have gained unusual insights into necromancy.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 2nd, ability to cast spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You can add one necromancy spell from the sorcerer/ wizard spell list to your spellbook, familiar, or list of spells you can prepare or to your spells known. This spell must be of a level you can cast. A spell learned in this fashion is treated as though it were on your class spell list. If you normally cast your spells from the sorcerer/wizard spells list, you can add a necromancy spell from the cleric or witch spell list instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You cast any spell from a school other than necromancy as though your caster level were 1 lower, which might prevent you from casting the spell altogether.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: You can gain this manifestation multiple times. Each time you gain the gift, you gain a different necromancy spell, and each time you gain the stain, the penalties stack.</p>"}

Chapter 1: Horror Characters}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your body is slowly wasting away. As your body decays, you must gradually replace more and more of it with artificial components-corpse flesh, bone, wood, metal, or other exotic materials.</p>\n<h1>CATALYST</h1>\n<p>This corruption stems from experimentation designed to create or extend life-perhaps you were a willing participant in an alchemist's research or brought back from the dead by an unconventional means that robbed you of your humanity.</p>\n<h1>Progression</h1>\n<p>Whenever you fail a Fortitude save against any effect or fall below 0 hit points, you must attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 15 + your manifestation level). If you fail that save, some of the living components of your body begin to fail. Within the next 3 days, you or someone you trust must spend 8 hours replacing more of your body with construct parts. If you don't do so, you die, and even if you are brought back from the dead with <em>resurrection </em>or <em>true resurrection </em>(which are necessary since your body isn't viable), you still must perform the operation or you die again in 3 days. After an operation, there is a 50% chance your corruption progresses to the next stage. If it doesn't, the DC of the above Fortitude save increases by 2 until your corruption reaches the next stage. These increases stack.</p>\n<p>While your body parts are failing (after you've failed the Fort save but before you've repaired your body), you don't have to attempt additional saves when you fail a Fortitude save or fall below 0 hit points. Once you've been repaired, you need to attempt saves in these circumstances again.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 1</strong>: The first time your corruption progresses, you fall into routines easily, performing repetitive actions. Your alignment shifts one step toward neutral.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 2</strong>: The second time your corruption progresses, you find you can't bring yourself to care about things or even to love. Your alignment shifts to neutral.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 3</strong>: The third time your corruption progresses, too much of your body is gone for your soul to remain. You become a mindless, destructive automaton or free-willed evil construct under the GM's control.</p>\n<h1>Removing the Corruption</h1>\n<p>Getting rid of a corruption requires invasive surgery to remove the artificial components fused to your body. Even these procedures might not cure your underlying wasting, so you might need to scour medical and alchemical tomes and consult divine spellcasters for a safer procedure than replacing your body parts in the way you were before. Powerful magic like <em>miracle </em>or <em>wish </em>in conjunction with <em>regenerate </em>might strip the components from your body and prevent the wasting.</p>\n<h1>MANIFESTATIONS</h1>\n<p>The following are manifestations of the promethean corruption.</p>\n<h1>Armored</h1>\n<p>Your body is unnaturally hardened against attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Plates bolted to your bones or flesh like leather protect your body. You gain a +1 natural armor bonus to your AC. At manifestation level 5th, this bonus increases to +2.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Your take a -1 penalty on Dexterity- and Strength-based skill checks. At manifestation level 5th, this penalty changes to -2.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: Upon receiving this manifestation, you must take both the gift and the stain, even with the useful corruption or vile corruption variants (see page 14).</p>\n<h1>Berserk Fury</h1>\n<p>The only emotion left to you is rage.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You can voluntarily enter an enraged state as a free action for a number of rounds per day equal to your manifestation level; these rounds don't have to be consecutive. Once you end this state, you can't enter it again for 1 minute. While enraged, you gain a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls, 1 temporary hit point per character level, and a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves. You are in control of yourself during this rage, but you must still succeed at a Will save to resist losing control (as detailed in this manifestation's stain). While voluntarily enraged, you take a -2 penalty on Will saves.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: When you're hit by a critical hit or drop below half your maximum hit points, you must succeed at a Will save (DC = 15 + your manifestation level) or become enraged for a number of rounds equal to your manifestation level. You gain the benefits of this manifestation's gift, but you're completely out of control, making melee attacks against the nearest creature (roll randomly if there are multiple targets).</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: Upon receiving this manifestation, you must take both the gift and the stain, even with the useful corruption or vile corruption variants (see page 14).</p>\n<h1>Greater Armored</h1>\n<p>Your body is covered in thick armored plating.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 5th, armored*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Your natural armor bonus to your AC from the armored manifestation increases by 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: The penalty from armored changes to -3. All your movement speeds decrease by 10 feet.</p>\n<h1>Greater Shattered Body</h1>\n<p>Nearly all your body is replaced by artificial components.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 5th, armored*, shattered body*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Your body is almost entirely artificial, save for a few organic components tethering you to your original life.</p>\n<p>Your bonus on saving throws against poison and diseases from shattered body is equal to your manifestation level. You automatically stabilize when you are below 0 hit points. You no longer need to eat, drink, or sleep. You must still rest for at least 8 hours to prepare spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Most of your internal organs have been replaced. You can no longer benefit from potions, elixirs, extracts, or any other beneficial item that requires consumption.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: You can gain this manifestation only if you have failed another corruption progression saving throw and replaced more of your body with construct parts since the time you took shattered body.</p>\n<h1>Greater Shattered Mind</h1>\n<p>You can understand no emotion but rage.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 6th, corruption stage 2, shattered mind*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You become immune to all mind-affecting emotion effects, except those that produce emotions of rage, hatred, or anger.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You have lost the ability to understand love or joy. You can't benefit from morale bonuses or bardic performances.</p>\n<h1>Promethean Transfiguration</h1>\n<p>You are more machine now than mortal.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 7th, corruption stage 2, armored*, greater shattered body*, greater shattered mind*, shattered body*, shattered mind*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You become immune to bleed, disease, paralysis, poison, sleep effects, and stunning.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: So much of your body is now gone that you struggle to remain alive. You take a -4 penalty to your Constitution score.</p>\n<h1>Rampage</h1>\n<p>When you fly into a rage, you destroy everything nearby.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Berserk fury*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: While enraged, you deal double damage to objects and gain a +4 bonus on Strength checks to break objects.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Returning from the heights of fury takes a toll on your body. You are staggered for 1 minute after ending a rage of any kind (including berserk fury, barbarian rage, and the <em>rage </em>spell). Nothing can remove this condition, nor does immunity to being staggered prevent it.</p>\n<h1>Replacement Limb</h1>\n<p>One of your arms has been replaced by a prosthetic.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Armored*, shattered body*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain one slam attack as a primary natural weapon. This slam deals 1d6 points of damage if your size is Medium (1d4 if Small).</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You take a -2 penalty on Dexterity-based skill checks and ability checks using your hands, as well as on Dexterity-based attack rolls.</p>\n<h1>Shattered Body</h1>\n<p>The last time you added more construct parts to your body, you reached a tipping point.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Armored*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain a bonus on Fortitude saves against poison and disease equal to half your manifestation level. Additionally, you require only half as much food and water as normal, and half as much rest as normal to gain a full night's sleep. However, you must still rest for at least 8 hours to prepare spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You are treated as both a construct and your original creature type for spells and effects that target creatures by type (such as the <em>bane </em>weapon special ability or a ranger's favored enemy class feature).</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: You can gain this manifestation only if you have failed at least one corruption progression saving throw and replaced more of your body with construct parts.</p>\n<h1>Shattered Mind</h1>\n<p>Your transformation damaged your psyche.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Corruption Stage 1 or 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Your dulled emotions are more difficult to affect with magic. You gain a +2 bonus on Will saves against emotion effects, and if you have this manifestation's stain, you don't need to roll twice and take the lower result against them. This doesn't apply to emotion effects that cause rage, hatred, or anger. At manifestation level 5th, this bonus increases to +4.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Now easy to manipulate, you roll twice and take the lower result against compulsion effects.</p>"}

Chapter 6: Running Horror Adventures}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The promise of fear is often obvious from the first glimpse of a horror film or story, as subtly abnormal choices in the ambience set the mood for terror. Horror adventures should feel much the same. More so than other Pathfinder RPG adventures, these rely on the creation of the atmosphere, the mood that surrounds the game. Atmosphere can mean the difference between a normal session and a truly frightening experience. This section focuses on gameplay techniques and storytelling special effects aimed at creating a moodier, more disturbing atmosphere. These suggestions step beyond game rules, and the advice herein can help GMs deftly defy the expectations of both the characters and their players.</p>\n<h1>Ten Questions to Help You Design a Horror Adventure</h1>\n<table style=\"width: 764px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">1.</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">What is there to be afraid of?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">2.</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">What caused the horrific situation to develop or spike?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">3.</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">How does the adventure's environment reinforce the horror's fearsomeness or a sense of dread?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">4.</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">What hides the horror or builds the tension?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">5.</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">What do the PCs fear losing?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">6.</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Do the PCs have resources that allow them to negate the horror?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">7.</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">What gives the PCs hope of defeating their enemy?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">8.</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">What shocking event lets the PCs know that nothing is safe?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">9.</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">What scenes or settings exist to release tension?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">10.</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Are elements unintentionally predictable, clichd, or similar to well-known horror tales?</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1>How to Scare Heroes</h1>\n<p>There's no one route to telling a good horror story, nor is there just one way to run a great horror adventure. GMs can take a three-pronged approach to unsettling the PCs.</p>\n<p><strong>Narrative Dread</strong>: Something can be made frightening by building tension. A GM wants her story to evoke a sense of dread, which is the expectation of harm or terrible things. Stories should be built so the characters expect horrible things before they actually see anything. Situations should get gradually worse and be punctuated by encounters that feature terrible creatures or that provide evidence of gruesome fates. Don't give the characters all of the details, though. Let them imagine that things are even worse than they appear. Then, when the situation is at its most tense, the monster or other shocking feature of the story is revealed. For more details, see Creating Horror Adventures on page 198.</p>\n<p><strong>Dramatic Storytelling</strong>: The Art of GMing section on page 28 of the&nbsp;<em>GameMastery Guide&nbsp;</em>presents numerous tips to help anyone become a more engaging Game Master. A GM is the window through which players experience a horror story. A GM can follow the techniques of skilled ghost storytellers and consider how her voice, tempo, movements, and what she chooses to focus on can work to build an ominous atmosphere.</p>\n<p><strong>Ominous Setting</strong>: The adventure's most fearful moments transpire in the players' imaginations, but what happens in the real world can help it along. See Creating Horror Atmosphere on page 204 for suggestions on how to prepare a game space for terror.</p>\n<h1>How to Scare Players</h1>\n<p>Numerous guides, stories, and films exist that can help GMs tell a better horror story. However, few explicitly help a GM run better horror adventures. Telling a great story is only part of a horror adventure. The GM still runs a Pathfinder game, and unlike most horror stories, this means the players are not just her audience but also the stars of her story. While she wants to terrify the characters, she wants to give the players the opportunity to dread something as well-to share a sympathetic sort of fear with their characters. While the game's atmosphere can contribute to players' fear, a GM can also subtly alter the roleplaying game experience to sow suspicion and dismay. The following techniques are essentially GM special effects and are best used sparingly.</p>\n<h1>Secrets and Suspicion</h1>\n<p>Players occasionally learn things at different times or find themselves in cahoots with the GM regarding some larger plot. Rather than trying to hide that one player has secret information, consider broadcasting it. As soon as the players know they don't share an even footing, matters of trust and suspicion become a choice rather than a foregone conclusion. Consider the following techniques to build suspicion between players.</p>\n<p><strong>The Secret</strong>: The GM has one player step outside of the room with her or otherwise out of earshot of the other players. She then provides him with secret information he's learned during the course of play or something only he's noticed. She possibly gets a brief response, then as swiftly as possible, they return to the game table. How and whether that information is shared with the rest of the party is up to the player-but now everyone knows that something special happened to him.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bluff</strong>: The GM pulls a player away from the table and asks him how he thinks the game is going, or how his day is, or tells him there's nothing special to reveal. Then they return to the game. Now all the other players think the player has a secret. Even if the player tells the truth and explains that he was pulled away for no reason, who in the party's going to believe him?</p>\n<p><strong>The Observation</strong>: The GM pulls a player away and tells him something inconsequential-maybe that his character feels like rats are staring at him, that he never noticed the hint of blond in the bard's hair, or that all the fallen leaves seem to point to the west. Now the player has to wonder whether this is a meaningful secret or just a random observation. Maybe he fixates on it-especially if the GM encourages him to do so. Perhaps he mentions it to the other players, at which point the GM can decide whether to confirm the observation and have the other characters notice too, or to deny it, causing the other characters to mistrust the observer and causing the observer to mistrust her. This works particularly well if a single character has become slightly unhinged or if one character is legitimately more perceptive than the others.</p>\n<p><strong>The Shell Game</strong>: Combining the techniques above, the GM calls each player away from the table one at a time. She tells one character something relevant, but provides the others with either nothing or pointless observations. The players who got nothing now have to wonder if they were the only ones, while the player who learned a secret has to wonder what other players learned. This works well in situations where one player has become the GM's coconspirator-perhaps via an enchantment effect on the player's character or by the PC being replaced by a monster.</p>\n<h1>Dice and Other Deceits</h1>\n<p>Much of the structure of a Pathfinder game can seem like a foregone conclusion. But in a horror game, nothing need be sacred. Consider manipulating the fundamental activities of the game to keep the players off guard.</p>\n<p><strong>The Mystery Roll</strong>: The GM asks a player to roll a d20 and makes a show of noting the result. When the player asks what the roll was for, the GM tells him not to worry about it. She might not need this roll for anything at all, but the players won't know that. This works particularly well for refocusing the attention of distracted players.</p>\n<p><strong>The Stolen Check</strong>: The GM rolls a d20 and asks a player what his Perception modifier is. She notes the result. Repeat for the entire group-or not. This could just be a technique to make the players wonder if they've missed something, or it could be a legitimate hidden check (there are even several sorts of rolls that generally dictate that they are rolled by the GM). This trick works best when used in both ways throughout a game, leaving the players wondering about any given stolen check. As a variation, the GM might have the players roll 10 Perception checks at the start of the session and keep the results on hand. During the adventure, don't ask players to roll Perception checks, just reference the existing bank for results. That way the players won't know whether they rolled well and noticed all there is or poorly enough that they should search again.</p>\n<p><strong>Reconsider Game Aides</strong>: Many Pathfinder adventures feature a variety of tools that encourage strategy and precision gaming. A GM could throw precision out the window. When vague horrors are reduced to pawns and squares, the fearfulness of the unknown withers. Instead, the GM might play faster and looser with game measurements, tracking player arrangements vaguely on whiteboards or in the imagination alone, erring in the PCs' favor in terms of range and movement whenever possible. It takes some experimentation, but GMs can find that players identify more intimately with characters in their heads than with miniatures on the game table.</p>\n<h1>Stress and Uncertainty</h1>\n<p>The PCs should never feel like they're entirely in control in a horror game. Just as their characters should feel unsure about what's going to happen, the players should experience their own uncertainty. Whether in a GM's storytelling or how she runs encounters, the following techniques can help add tension to a game.</p>\n<p><strong>Accentuate the Unnatural</strong>: The GM is the game's narrator. That doesn't mean she has to be an impartial or reliable narrator. Consider having the world seem to function in ways it shouldn't-or in outright supernatural manners. A creak might sound like a player's name; the wind coming through the window might cease as soon as the PCs enter the room; a rat might stop in the middle of the hall, rise on its back legs, look into the characters' eyes, and whisper \"Beware.\" These elements don't need rules because they're not dangers or things to fight. They're glimpses into the world-a world where something is unsettlingly wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>Acting with Urgency</strong>: The GM can describe a battle as being as hectic as she pleases, but if the PCs have lengthy strategic conversations during combat, it loses any hint of urgency. The GM can make the situation's stressfulness real by demanding that PCs act swiftly. Speak quickly and demand to know what a PC will do as soon as his turn comes up in initiative. If he falters or reaches for a book, the GM insists that he either delay his turn or make a decision in 6 seconds or else he loses his action-then begin counting down. The purpose here isn't to cheat players out of turns, but a constrained window of action lets the players share the same strain as their characters. Don't be too much of a stickler about the countdown, especially with players new to the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Countdown to Terror</strong>: During a stressful situation, the GM starts a tally of rounds that pass, sets a timer or countdown, or makes a show of accounting for the time-\"This is round three, right?\" Ideally, this countdown leads to an occurrence on a particular round, but it doesn't have to. It could just be a trick to make the PCs worry that something's coming. Alternatively, a GM can strip the mystery away and let the players know something their characters couldn't: that when the countdown ends, something terrible will happen. What? That's up to the GM. But unless the PCs manage to defeat the monster, activate the device, or escape, things are about to get worse.</p>\n<p><strong>Purposeful Misperceptions</strong>: The GM tells a PC that he thinks he hears something. When he asks what, he's told he doesn't know, and then can decide whether he investigates further. Maybe the GM tells him he thinks it's nothing-but can he be sure? It could be something the character heard, a shadow he thought he saw move, or even just a memory that pops to mind. Regardless, by giving PCs bits of uncertain or unsettlingly meaningless information, they begin to wonder what's important and what's not, what's real and what's just in their character's head.</p>\n<p><strong>Refuse Rest</strong>: When the PCs rest, they recover hit points, spells, and other abilities or elements the adventure has worn down. But when the PCs can't rest, the situation becomes more dire. Spellcasters covet their last spells, healers wait to dole out their last potions, and combatants think more strategically and retreat more readily when their hit points run low. How a GM denies the party rest might involve the adventure needing to occur within a limited span of time or there merely being no convenient safe space. As an alternative, circumstances might prevent a rest from recovering the PCs' resources (for instance, the&nbsp;<em>nightmare&nbsp;</em>spell prevents an arcane spellcaster from preparing spells). While this technique is crucial for portraying dwindling resources and maintaining momentum and tension, use it with care. Players quickly grow frustrated if the restrictions seem artificial rather than tied to the story.</p>\n<p><strong>Splitting the Party</strong>: It's relatively common in horror stories for the protagonists to become separated. If this happens in a game, the GM divides the group and sends those who aren't currently playing out of the room-she doesn't want them knowing their allies' fate or distracting the players currently in the limelight. Switch between groups about every 10 or 15 minutes until the group meets back up, trying to end each scene with a group either on a mini-cliffhanger or at a point when they have something to discuss (which can happen away from the table). Keep the party split for as brief a period as possible; not only are divided groups weaker in a fight, but players quickly lose their immersion when away from the game table and forced to put the game on hold.</p>\n<h1>Death and Bargaining</h1>\n<p>Sometimes characters die. That's not fun for anyone, though-especially if the GM has spent a considerable amount of time on a story that now might never take shape. While players should feel like doom looms around the next corner, the threat of death and the idea of defeat are far more useful than actually killing off the entire group. Few GMs are above fudging a die roll, having a foe die suddenly, or having villains start taking prisoners if bad rolls turn an encounter against the players. Total party kills should be reserved for when they make the best stories, like at the hands of a truly terrible foe.</p>\n<p>Still, sometimes characters die, and it's not always convenient or plausible to stop the adventure to find a cleric capable of restoring them. In such cases, a GM might take it on herself to make a deal with a player, trading a miraculous recovery (and thus, his continued role in the game) for a price she determines. Such a bargain might last for a set period: until the session's end, until it's convenient to make a new character, until the party comes up with a better solution, or-most menacingly-simply until the GM says so. The terms of the deal should be set outside the earshot of the other players, and the PC has the right to refuse. Regardless of the specifics, if the PC accepts, he works for the GM now, a factor that can lend new threats to several sorts of horror games. In all of these cases, the GM should take the blame for the PC's treachery because she doesn't want to cause hurt feelings between players.</p>\n<p><strong>The Doppelganger</strong>: Inform the PC that he barely survived-but only because he was replaced by a shapeshifting creature at some point in the past. He is now playing a monster with the exact same statistics as his character. When he sees an opportune moment, he should attack or otherwise betray the party to the villain. Once this occurs and the player's monstrous nature is revealed, it raises the question of what happened to the real character- who might now be a prisoner somewhere, waiting to be saved by the others.</p>\n<p><strong>The Evil Spirit</strong>: Inform the PC that he died, but his corpse has been animated by an evil spirit. He can continue to play as normal, but when something in particular happens in the story (or simply when the GM says \"now\"), he should turn on the rest of the party or perform some other action prescribed-like attack the paladin. The GM might grant the character some fitting special ability or other monstrous power.</p>\n<p><strong>The Devil</strong>: Inform the PC that he died and now stands before a devil, a grim reaper(B5), or something worse. This godlike entity offers to return the PC to life but will come to call later and demand a service. Whatever this service might be, the PC is compelled to comply and also to keep the terms of the bargain secret. Perhaps the GM knows what the entity wants at the bargain's outset, but even if not, this kind of loose thread is perfect for future exploitation.</p>\n<h1>Encouraging Horror Roleplaying</h1>\n<p>Pathfinder is not a game anyone wins, but it's not uncommon for players to want to overcome challenges in an exceptional fashion or with the minimum expenditure of resources. That means that some players view time spent indulging in terrified reactions and unheroic roleplaying as a waste of time-particularly when such roleplaying arises during combat encounters. If a GM wants her players to care about and emphasize not just roleplaying but also reacting to horror, it's up to her to encourage it-or at least not to penalize it. To incentivize her players into displaying frightened reactions, she can point them toward the Playing a Horror Hero discussion on page 8, and consider employing the following techniques.</p>\n<p><strong>Time for Terror</strong>: Many players' first reaction to a threat, no matter how overwhelming, will be to fight.</p>\n<p>Before rolling initiative for a particularly terrifying scene, the GM can ask the players whether any of them would like to use the instant before combat for a terrified reaction. This is not a surprise round or any other in-game unit of measurement, but rather a special instance for characters who want to play up their reaction to the scene with a free action like yelling a warning, dropping an object, falling backward, or shrieking. In this way, the GM rewards players who want to express their shock and gets the group's reactions all at once, rather than drawing out the first round of combat.</p>\n<p><strong>Reward Terror</strong>: Whenever a player does something that improves the game's story, enhances the session's atmosphere, or just seems cool, the GM can give the party an ad hoc experience award. There are few more powerful ways to encourage behavior that benefits the game than with immediate positive reinforcement, and the GM has an endless supply of experience points to dole out. This shouldn't be much, maybe as little as 50 XP at lower levels, maybe creeping up to 200 XP at higher levels-nothing that feels like a game-changer. Even then, though, a little reward can serve as a strong incentive to encourage good roleplaying and story investment. Best of all, it encourages not just one player but the entire group to prioritize behavior the GM rewards.</p>\n<h1>Going Too Far</h1>\n<p>Some GMs make the mistake of thinking that if a frightening gimmick works for a haunted house or campfire story, then it will work for their horror adventures. Such is rarely the case. At best, overdoing it on artificial, half-creepy tricks can break the atmosphere and distract from the game. At worst, they become jokes or can upset players. As a rule, a GM should keep a horror game on the game table. Here are a few gimmicks to absolutely avoid.</p>\n<p><strong>Don't Fake Emergencies</strong>: Faking choking or pretending the slasher attack is real can be legitimately scary in a way that violates players' trust. The game must remain a game, and as soon as it breaks the fourth wall and enters reality, things can go off the rails fast. Never risk someone getting hurt or having the authorities get involved.</p>\n<p><strong>Don't Involve People Outside the Game</strong>: Those who haven't joined the game should not have to experience the game's creepy elements, whether that be loud music, in-character shrieking, or other disruptive sounds. Additionally, never ask outside coconspirators to secretly participate in the game unbeknownst to the players.</p>\n<p><strong>Don't Touch the Players</strong>: Whether this means getting into character and clamping a cold hand on a player's shoulder or physically dropping plastic spiders from the ceiling, never invade the players' personal space or set up tricks that could backfire and cause physical harm.</p>\n<p><strong>Don't Use Costumes or Makeup</strong>: Costumes and fake blood are distractions. If a GM tries to make herself look creepy, it might work for a minute, but most games run longer than that. After a while, the prop or special effect becomes commonplace, or worse, just silly.</p>"}

Some must be worn in a specific magic item slot in order to work, while others must merely be kept on hand and used. \"Wondrous item\" is a catchall category for anything that doesn't fall into other groups, such as armor, weapons, staves, and so on. Anyone can use a wondrous item unless the item specifies otherwise.</p>\n<p>There are two main categories of wondrous items: slotted and slotless. A slotted item takes up a magic item slot and must be worn by someone who wants to employ the item or benefit from its abilities.</p>\n<h1>Table 7-8: Wondrous Items</h1>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\"><strong>Least Minor Slotless Item</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"4\"><strong>Price</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Akoben talisman</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">450 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Pentacle talisman</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">600 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Scarab talisman</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">600 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Triskelion talisman</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">600 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\"><strong>Lesser Minor Slotless Item</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"4\"><strong>Price</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Ankh talisman</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">1,250 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Brilliant flash symbol</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">1,600 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Oil of attraction</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">1,700 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Channel-thieving belt</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">2,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Silver nail</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">2,100 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Hamsa talisman</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">3,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\"><strong>Greater Minor Slotless Item</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"4\"><strong>Price</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Monster almanac</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">4,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Purifying ointment</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">4,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Wolf caller's horn</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">4,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Greater akoben talisman</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">4,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Eldritch scholar's monocle</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">5,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Perilous puzzle box</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">5,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Mantle of the darkest night</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">6,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Pain ward of the ostiarius</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">6,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Greater pentacle talisman</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">6,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Greater scarab talisman</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">6,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Greater triskelion talisman</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">6,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Witchlight lantern</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">7,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\"><strong>Lesser Medium Slotless Item</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"4\"><strong>Price</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Gloves of feasting</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">8,400 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Redemptor's blessing</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">9,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Greater channel-thieving belt</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">9,200 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Greater ankh talisman</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">12,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Urn of smoldering shapes</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">16,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Crimson altar</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">17,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\"><strong>Greater Medium Slotless Item</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"4\"><strong>Price</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Black heart</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">18,800 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Greater monster almanac</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">20,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\"><strong>Lesser Major Slotless Item</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"4\"><strong>Price</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Greater hamsa talisman</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">30,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Blackmarrow altar</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">32,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Dark lens altar</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">40,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Mantle of life</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">48,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Necromancer's beacon</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">48,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\"><strong>Greater Major Slotless Item</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"4\"><strong>Price</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Moonlight lantern</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">66,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Threshold guardian</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">66,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1>BLACK HEART</h1>\n<p><strong>PRICE</strong> 18,800 GP</p>\n<p><strong>SLOT</strong> none <strong>CL</strong> 5th <strong>WEIGHT</strong> 1/2 lb.</p>\n<p><strong>AURA</strong> faint necromancy [evil]</p>\n<p>This withered, black heart is disturbingly cool to the touch. It must be attuned to an evil deity in a vile ritual that takes at least 1 hour and requires a living sentient creature as a sacrifice before the wielder can use its powers. Once attuned, it counts as an unholy symbol of that deity for all purposes (such as acting as a divine focus for spellcasting) and can't be attuned to another deity until at least 1 week has passed since its last use.</p>\n<p>By brandishing the <em>black heart </em>as a standard action, the wielder can detect the presence of good creatures. If any good creatures are within 60 feet, the withered heart begins to slowly beat. The heart doesn't show the wielder who specifically is good, but it does beat faster the closer to a good creature it comes. The wielder can activate this ability once per day, and it lasts as long as she concentrates, to a maximum of 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>If the wielder brandishes the heart and concentrates, the wielder can squeeze the heart as a standard action, targeting a living creature within 60 feet. The target takes 3d8+5 points of damage and becomes sickened for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 14 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the sickened effect. This is a negative energy effect, and evil creatures are immune to it.</p>\n<p>CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p><strong>COST</strong> 9,400 GP</p>\n<p>Craft Wondrous Item, <em>detect good</em>, <em>inflict serious wounds</em>, creator must be an evil worshiper of an evil deity</p>\n<h1>BLACKMARROW ALTAR</h1>\n<p><strong>PRICE</strong> 32,500 GP</p>\n<p><strong>SLOT</strong> none <strong>CL</strong> 17th <strong>WEIGHT</strong> 24 lbs.</p>\n<p><strong>AURA</strong> strong necromancy [evil]</p>\n<p>This altar is built from skulls and bones as black as onyx. When placed upright on a solid surface, the altar begins radiating negative energy, as per <em>desecrate</em>. If the altar is knocked over, the effect ends until the altar is righted as a move action. A spellcaster can use a <em>blackmarrow altar </em>as a focus when casting <em>animate dead </em>or <em>create undead</em>. The spell then doesn't require onyx gems as a material component. Instead, the altar supplies the unholy energy needed for casting the spell. The altar can sustain a maximum of 20 Hit Dice of undead creatures created this way, and it can't create more than 20 HD of undead creatures in a week even if previously created undead are destroyed. The undead creatures can't create spawn or use similar abilities.</p>\n<p>When undead creatures created with the altar as a focus move farther than 100 feet away from it, dark fumes continuously pour out from their eyes (or eye sockets) and mouths. Any such undead creature needs to return to the altar's vicinity within 4 hours to replenish its negative energy. If unable to do so, the creature is immediately destroyed after 4 hours.</p>\n<p>CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p><strong>COST</strong> 16,250 GP</p>\n<p>Craft Wondrous Item, <em>desecrate</em></p>\n<h1>BRILLIANT FLASH SYMBOL</h1>\n<p><strong>PRICE</strong> 1,600 GP</p>\n<p><strong>SLOT</strong> none <strong>CL</strong> 3rd <strong>WEIGHT</strong> 1/2 lb.</p>\n<p><strong>AURA</strong> faint evocation</p>\n<p>This holy (or unholy) symbol is crafted from brilliantly polished clear quartz with a facet that contains a small sapphire. When brandished, the symbol catches and amplifies the surrounding light into a blinding flare. This has several effects.</p>\n<p>When the bearer uses the holy symbol to channel energy (whether she channels positive or negative energy), any creature that takes damage must succeed at a DC 10 Fortitude save or be dazzled for 1 round.</p>\n<p>If the bearer casts a spell using a <em>brilliant flash symbol </em>as a divine focus, she can force up to three creatures affected by the spell to attempt a DC 10 Fortitude save; any who fail are dazzled for 1 round in addition to any of the spell's other effects. The bearer can permanently expend the magic inside the small sapphire to cause the creatures to instead be blinded if they fail the save or dazzled if they succeed at it. This causes the sapphire to crumble into fine powder.</p>\n<p>A <em>brilliant flash symbol </em>functions only in areas with some kind of ambient light. It loses all of its powers in areas of total darkness.</p>\n<p>CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p><strong>COST</strong> 800 GP</p>\n<p>Craft Wondrous Item, <em>flare</em>, channel energy class feature</p>\n<h1>CHANNEL-THIEVING BELT</h1>\n<p><strong>PRICE</strong> 2,000 GP</p>\n<p><strong>SLOT</strong> belt <strong>CL</strong> 3rd <strong>WEIGHT</strong> 2 lbs.</p>\n<p><strong>AURA</strong> faint conjuration and necromancy</p>\n<p>This wide black leather belt is inlaid with spiraling copper runes. If the wearer is a living creature, she heals each time she is within the area of a burst of channeled positive energy used to deal damage to undead creatures. If the wearer is an undead creature, it heals each time it is within the area of a burst of channeled negative energy used to deal damage to living creatures. The wearer regains 1 hit point for each 1d6 points of energy channeled. The belt has no effect if its wearer is the one channeling energy.</p>\n<p>CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p><strong>COST</strong> 1,000 GP</p>\n<p>Craft Wondrous Item, <em>cure light wound</em>, <em>inflict light wounds</em></p>\n<h1>CHANNEL-THIEVING BELT, GREATER</h1>\n<p><strong>PRICE</strong> 9,200 GP</p>\n<p><strong>SLOT</strong> belt <strong>CL</strong> 7th <strong>WEIGHT</strong> 2 lbs.</p>\n<p><strong>AURA</strong> moderate conjuration and necromancy</p>\n<p>This belt functions as a normal <em>channel-thieving belt</em>, except the amount of healing is equal to 1/2 the amount of damage healed or dealt by the creature channeling energy.</p>\n<p>CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p><strong>COST</strong> 4,600 GP</p>\n<p>Craft Wondrous Item, <em>cure serious wounds</em>, <em>inflict serious wounds</em></p>\n<h1>CRIMSON ALTAR</h1>\n<p><strong>PRICE</strong> 17,500 GP</p>\n<p><strong>SLOT</strong> none <strong>CL</strong> 8th <strong>WEIGHT</strong> 28 lbs.</p>\n<p><strong>AURA</strong> moderate necromancy</p>\n<p>This red marble altar is carved in the shape of two legless humans conjoined at the waist, their heads facing opposite directions. The figure's four arms are bent at the elbow, supporting the altar like the legs of a table would. Each face is featureless save for a gaping maw, and hollow moans occasionally escape from their taut, perpetually blood-stained marble lips.</p>\n<p>Whenever a creature within 40 feet of the altar takes piercing or slashing damage, the altar's foul magic invades the wound and forces it to stay open, automatically dealing 1d4 points of bleed damage. This bleed damage doesn't stack with any bleed damage the attack would normally deal, nor does it stack with itself.</p>\n<p>Unholy magic beckons spilled blood to crawl toward the altar. There is a shallow, round indentation on the altar; if a silver cup worth 25 gp is placed within, crimson nectar trickles into the cup each time a creature within 40 feet takes bleed damage. The cup is filled to the brim once 30 points of bleed damage have been dealt within 40 feet of the altar. As a standard action, a creature can drink the nectar to regain 5d6 hit points. The nectar heals both living and undead creatures. The nectar loses its potency and turns into clotted blood if it is not consumed within 1 round of the cup being removed from the altar. The altar can produce 3 full cups of healing nectar per day.</p>\n<p>CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p><strong>COST</strong> 8,750 GP</p>\n<p>Craft Wondrous Item, <em>bleed</em>, <em>death knell</em></p>\n<h1>DARK LENS ALTAR</h1>\n<p><strong>PRICE</strong> 40,000 GP</p>\n<p><strong>SLOT</strong> none <strong>CL</strong> 13th <strong>WEIGHT</strong> 37 lbs.</p>\n<p><strong>AURA</strong> strong conjuration</p>\n<p>Set in the center of this dark steel altar is an eye-shaped, obsidian lens. Many-eyed horrors from dark spaces between the stars stare back through the lens. When viewed from different angles, the altar's proportions seem to change as though space were bent around the object.</p>\n<p>Whenever a creature within 60 feet of the altar casts a <em>summon monster </em>or <em>summon nature's ally </em>spell (or uses either spell as a spell-like ability), the creature can use the altar as a focus for the spell. Any creatures summoned this way emerge from the dark lens, appearing adjacent to the altar. The creatures are strangely mutated, gaining the benefit of <em>lesser evolution surge</em>(APG) as though they were eidolons with no base form. They still must meet all prerequisites for an evolution, including having particular natural attacks, and they count as the eidolons of a summoner with a summoner level equal to the level of the summoning spell for the purposes of satisfying prerequisites and determining how many total attacks per round they can use. There is a 25% chance that any creature summoned through the lens attempts to kill the summoner rather than obeying the summoner's commands. Roll once per casting for all creatures summoned, and if the creatures turn on their summoner, the summoner can't dismiss the spell as normal (though it still expires when the duration ends).</p>\n<p>When the summoned creature appears, the planar rift through which it passes creates a vacuum near the altar for 1 round. Each creature within 5 feet per level of the summoning spell is affected by a severe blast of air (as per <em>gust of wind</em>) directed toward the altar. A summoning spell of 4th level or higher creates a more powerful vacuum; all creatures within the area are treated as one size category smaller for the purpose of determining how the vacuum affects them. If the summoning spell is 7th level or higher, the creatures are treated as two size categories smaller. If a creature summoned through the altar is ever forced into the altar's space, including by the vacuum effect, the summoning instantly ends as the creature is sucked back to its home dimension.</p>\n<p>CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p><strong>COST</strong> 20,000 GP</p>\n<p>Craft Wondrous Item, <em>lesser evolution surge</em>(APG), <em>plane shift</em></p>\n<h1>ELDRITCH SCHOLAR'S MONOCLE</h1>\n<p><strong>PRICE</strong> 5,000 GP</p>\n<p><strong>SLOT</strong> eyes <strong>CL</strong> 3rd <strong>WEIGHT</strong> -</p>\n<p><strong>AURA</strong> faint divination</p>\n<p>This lens, mounted in a round electrum frame, fits snugly over the wearer's eye. Upon donning the monocle, the user sees a swirl of arcane sigils through the lens, but the sensation quickly fades. The monocle allows the user to decipher magical inscriptions, as per <em>read magic</em>.</p>\n<p>Once worn for 24 consecutive hours, an <em>eldritch scholar's monocle </em>also protects the user from anything dangerous to read or view. While wearing the monocle, whenever the user triggers a curse effect, an effect that causes sanity loss, or a magic trap (such as <em>explosive runes </em>or <em>sepia snake sigil</em>) simply by reading or viewing an object, the monocle's glass starts shaking, pulling the wearer's attention away from the dangerous details in the object. This allows the wearer to roll any saving throw against such an effect twice and take the better result. This effect functions only once per day. For the remainder of the day, everything viewed through the lens appears blurred and distorted, and the <em>read magic </em>effect no longer functions.</p>\n<p>CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p><strong>COST</strong> 2,500 GP</p>\n<p>Craft Wondrous Item, <em>augury</em>, <em>read magic</em></p>\n<h1>GLOVES OF FEASTING</h1>\n<p><strong>PRICE</strong> 8,400 GP</p>\n<p><strong>SLOT</strong> hands <strong>CL</strong> 9th <strong>WEIGHT</strong> 1/2 lb.</p>\n<p><strong>AURA</strong> moderate transmutation</p>\n<p>Each of these leather gloves has a large, ragged hole in the palm. Upon donning the gloves, the wearer is nauseated with pain for 1 round as the skin on his palms rips open, revealing terrible gashes that each sprout fangs, lips, and a tongue. While the wearer's hands are empty, he can breathe, eat, drink, and speak through the mouths on his hands (though this doesn't allow him to drink more potions in a round, speak with more than one voice at a time, or otherwise take more actions than normal). The wearer retains the use of his hands; the mouths remain shut while the wearer is holding items in his hands.</p>\n<p>The wearer receives a +2 enhancement bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple a foe with his hands. If he begins his turn grappling with his hands, the wearer can make a free bite attack with one of the mouths on his hands. The bite is treated as a natural weapon and deals an amount of damage equal to 1d4 + his Strength modifier for a Medium wearer (1d3 + his Strength modifier if he's Small).</p>\n<p>CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p><strong>COST</strong> 4,200 GP</p>\n<p>Craft Wondrous Item, <em>polymorph</em></p>\n<h1>MANTLE OF LIFE</h1>\n<p><strong>PRICE</strong> 48,000 GP <strong>SLOT</strong> shoulders <strong>CL</strong> 10th <strong>WEIGHT</strong> 4 lbs.</p>\n<p><strong>AURA</strong> moderate necromancy</p>\n<p>This short cape shimmers faintly under light. The wearer is immune to the energy drain attacks made by undead creatures. She still suffers any other effects of the attack, but ignores the energy drain. If a corpse is wearing the mantle, it can't rise as an undead creature for any reason. This doesn't prevent creatures that were already undead from using abilities like rejuvenation to return to unlife.</p>\n<p>CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p><strong>COST</strong> 24,000 GP</p>\n<p>Craft Wondrous Item, <em>death ward</em></p>\n<h1>MANTLE OF THE DARKEST NIGHT</h1>\n<p><strong>PRICE</strong> 6,000 GP</p>\n<p><strong>SLOT</strong> shoulders <strong>CL</strong> 5th <strong>WEIGHT</strong> -</p>\n<p><strong>AURA</strong> faint evocation</p>\n<p>This cloak is woven from a fabric of solid darkness held together by magic alone. When the wearer takes the total defense action, the mantle quickly dissolves into a globe of darkness (as per <em>deeper darkness</em>) that is centered on the wearer. The darkness coalesces into a mantle on the wearer's shoulders again at the beginning of her next turn unless she immediately uses another total defense action to maintain it. This effect functions up to 10 rounds per day.</p>\n<p>If any of the item's daily uses are left, the wearer can grab the mantle and toss it into a space within 30 feet as a standard action. The mantle dissolves into a <em>deeper darkness </em>effect centered where the mantle landed and lasting for a number of rounds equal to the remaining daily uses. When the duration ends, the mantle materializes in the square into which the wearer threw it.</p>\n<p>CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p><strong>COST</strong> 3,000 GP</p>\n<p>Craft Wondrous Item, <em>deeper darkness</em></p>\n<h1>MONSTER ALMANAC</h1>\n<p><strong>PRICE</strong> 4,000 GP <strong>SLOT</strong> none <strong>CL</strong> 3rd <strong>WEIGHT</strong> 1/2 lb.</p>\n<p><strong>AURA</strong> faint divination</p>\n<p>This sketchbook has up to 100 pages full of scribbled notes and hasty sketches about monsters. When the user focuses on a particular page, the text and pictures start moving, revealing more details about the creature.</p>\n<p>The user must spend 10 minutes researching a particular type of monster to get any benefit from the almanac. If the user is trained in the appropriate Knowledge skill to identify a monster, he gets a +2 circumstance bonus on his check. He can attempt a Knowledge check to identify a creature despite being untrained in the appropriate skill (but without the +2 bonus) as long as the check's DC is no higher than 15.</p>\n<p>CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p><strong>COST</strong> 2,000 GP</p>\n<p>Craft Wondrous Item, <em>augury</em>, <em>silent image</em></p>\n<h1>MONSTER ALMANAC, GREATER</h1>\n<p><strong>PRICE</strong> 20,000 GP</p>\n<p><strong>SLOT</strong> none <strong>CL</strong> 11th <strong>WEIGHT</strong> 4 lbs</p>\n<p><strong>AURA</strong> moderate divination</p>\n<p>The countless pages of this heavy tome bear detailed illustrations and descriptions of creatures from the Material Plane and other planes, including numerous Material Plane planets and the vast black spaces between the stars. The book looks slim when closed, but when a user turns its pages, more and more pages appear.</p>\n<p>The user must spend at least 10 minutes researching a particular type of monster to get any benefit from the almanac. If the user is trained in the appropriate Knowledge skill to identify the monster, she gets a +5 circumstance bonus on her skill check. She can attempt a Knowledge check to identify a creature despite being untrained in the appropriate skill (without the +5 bonus) regardless of the DC.</p>\n<p>If the user spends 24 hours instead of 10 minutes, she can treat the check as though she got a result of 25. This functions much like using an extensive library and doesn't require the user to be trained in the relevant Knowledge skill.</p>\n<p>CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p><strong>COST</strong> 10,000 GP</p>\n<p>Craft Wondrous Item, <em>legend lore</em>, <em>major image</em></p>\n<h1>MOONLIGHT LANTERN</h1>\n<p><strong>PRICE</strong> 66,000 GP</p>\n<p><strong>SLOT</strong> none <strong>CL</strong> 13th <strong>WEIGHT</strong> 3 lbs.</p>\n<p><strong>AURA</strong> strong transmutation</p>\n<p>This intricate silver bullseye lantern filters its light through a stained-glass image of a howling wolf silhouetted by the moon. The pale blue light it casts does little to illuminate the surrounding area, casting dim light in a 60-foot cone directed by the lantern's bearer. The lantern can remain lit for 30 minutes per day. These minutes don't need to be used consecutively, but must be spent in 5-minute increments.</p>\n<p>When the lantern's light falls on a creature that is not in its true form or that has more than one form-such as a creature that has been polymorphed, a doppelganger, or a lycanthrope-the light shows all of that creature's forms. Anyone who can see the target perceives any additional forms as semi-transparent illusions superimposed over the creature's current form. This is a divination effect and otherwise works as per <em>true seeing</em>.</p>\n<p>Once per day as a standard action, the bearer can force a creature within the lantern's light to assume another of its forms. If the creature is under the effects of a spell with the polymorph descriptor, the bearer can attempt to dispel the effect (as per <em>dispel magic</em>) using the lantern's caster level. If the creature has the shapechanger subtype, it must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save to resist this effect. If it fails this saving throw, the bearer of the <em>moonlight lantern </em>can choose another of the target's forms and force it to transform immediately. The shapechanger doesn't need to spend an action to do so. The target must remain in the chosen form for at least 1 minute before it can shift again.</p>\n<p>CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p><strong>COST</strong> 33,000 GP</p>\n<p>Craft Wondrous Item, <em>dispel magic</em>, <em>greater polymorph</em>, <em>true seeing</em></p>\n<h1>NECROMANCER'S BEACON</h1>\n<p><strong>PRICE</strong> 48,000 GP</p>\n<p><strong>SLOT</strong> none <strong>CL</strong> 13th <strong>WEIGHT</strong> 1 lb.</p>\n<p><strong>AURA</strong> strong necromancy</p>\n<p>This gruesome lantern is made from bone and emerald-tinted glass.

This light makes living creatures uncomfortable, but does them no harm.</p>\n<p>A lit <em>necromancer's beacon </em>attracts undead creatures within 1,000 feet, whether they can see it or not. Sentient undead must succeed at a DC 20 Will save to avoid this effect, and mindless undead receive no saving throw. Any undead creature attracted by a <em>necromancer's beacon </em>must move as fast as it is able toward the lantern; once it comes within 60 feet of the lantern, the undead creature can act normally (unintelligent undead usually attempt to destroy the lantern). This effect is blocked by 1 foot of wood, 1 inch of stone, or a thin layer of lead. An intelligent undead that succeeds at its saving throw against a <em>necromancer's beacon </em>is forever immune to the effects of that particular <em>necromancer's beacon</em>.</p>\n<p>Undead creatures take 1 point of positive energy damage every round they remain within the light shed by a <em>necromancer's beacon</em>. If the lantern is destroyed, all undead are immediately freed from the lantern's compulsion.</p>\n<p>CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p><strong>COST</strong> 24,000 GP</p>\n<p>Craft Wondrous Item, <em>control undead</em></p>\n<h1>OIL OF ATTRACTION</h1>\n<p><strong>PRICE</strong> 1,700 GP</p>\n<p><strong>SLOT</strong> none <strong>CL</strong> 3rd <strong>WEIGHT</strong> 1/2 lb.</p>\n<p><strong>AURA</strong> faint necromancy</p>\n<p>This vial of foul-smelling unguent is a great boon for trackers and hunters. Each vial of oil is keyed to a particular kind of creature and functions only against such creatures. The kind of creature is fairly narrow.

It bears numerous sharp hooks and barbs. Rather than being suspended from a cord or chain, it grips directly onto the wearer's chest with a life of its own. When the item attaches, the user permanently loses 1 hit point and gains a +10 circumstance bonus to resist any attempts to steal the <em>pain ward of the ostiarius </em>and to the DC of other attempts to remove it (such as with Sleight of Hand). Once attached, this item can act as an unholy symbol for any evil deity and reshapes itself to match the symbol of an evil deity the wearer worships. If the unholy symbol is removed from the wearer, he takes 1d8 points of damage and 1 point of Constitution damage.</p>\n<p>The <em>pain ward of the ostiarius </em>grants an evil wearer a +4 profane bonus on any saving throws against spells and abilities with the pain(UM) descriptor. Once per day, the wearer can channel his pain into negative energy and inflict it on an unwilling victim. This is a touch attack that deals 1d8+5 points of negative energy damage and sickens the victim for 1d4 rounds.

While in its solved configuration, the puzzle box is safe to open and close, and the user can access an extradimensional compartment that can store up to 10 pounds of objects. The user can store a single touch spell of 4th level or lower in the box by casting the spell and touching the box. This spell has no effect until the box is changed to an unsolved state and someone subsequently tries and fails to solve it.</p>\n<p>Any creature can close the box and twist its segments, at which point the puzzle box becomes unsolved and requires a successful DC 20 Intelligence check to solve and open. Each subsequent consecutive round spent randomly twisting the segments increases the number of Intelligence checks needed to solve the puzzle, to a maximum of three checks after 3 rounds of scrambling. As soon as the creature ceases twisting the segments, it is no longer safe to change the configuration.</p>\n<p>Thereafter, twisting any segment triggers a 1-minute timer, during which the holder can safely attempt to solve the puzzle with a series of Intelligence checks. This requires two hands and a full-round action for each Intelligence check. If the timer runs out before the puzzle is solved or the creature pauses for 1 round in the middle of attempting to solve the puzzle, the touch spell stored in the <em>perilous puzzle box </em>(if any) discharges, automatically hitting any creature holding the box.</p>\n<p>Unless the attempt to solve the puzzle succeeds, after 1 minute, the box automatically reverts to the configuration it had before the attempt to solve the puzzle and locks itself for 24 hours.

The ash scatters in the air, but the particles quickly ignite, grow into smoldering embers, and gain momentum, coalescing in the target space as a vaguely humanoid shape. The urn produces 7 doses of ash per day. Throwing a pinch of ash uses 1 dose and creates a Small shape (AC 6, 10 hp) that is reminiscent of a cluster of cowering human children. The Small shape doesn't provide cover, but the square counts as difficult terrain. Throwing a small handful of ash uses 2 doses and creates a Medium shape (AC 5, 15 hp) that resembles a cluster of crestfallen adult humans. The Medium shape provides cover and prevents passage through the square. Throwing a large handful of ash uses 4 doses and creates a Large shape (AC 4, 25 hp) that resembles a sobbing angel. The Large shape provides cover and prevents passage through a 10-foot-square area.</p>\n<p>If the smoldering shape is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, it explodes, dealing fire damage in a 10-foot-radius spread depending on the size: 2d6 points for Small, 4d6 points for Medium, or 8d6 points for Large.

Chapter 2: Archetypes And Class Options}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Some occultists specialize in using the belongings of the restless dead or talismans that ward reality against the strange geometries of the beyond.</p>\n<h1>Haunt Collector (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Haunt collectors use items haunted by their former owners to create ghostly presences imbued with psychic power.</p>\n<p><strong>Possessed Possessions (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, and every 4 occultist levels thereafter, when the haunt collector chooses an implement school he doesn't already know, instead of using implements as normal for that school, he can gain access to a haunted implement-a powerful, spirit-possessed item collected during his travels. When he selects a haunted implement, he forsakes the resonant power from the item's implement group and instead selects a spirit from the medium's list of spirits (<em>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures </em>33), gaining that spirit's seance boon in place of the resonant power. He can also call upon the implement's haunting entity as a swift action to temporarily gain bonuses on all checks associated with the selected legendary spirit's spirit bonus for 1 round. This spirit bonus is equal to 1/2 the amount of mental focus invested in the implement, to a maximum bonus of 1 + 1 for every 4 occultist levels the haunt collector has. He can call upon this spirit bonus a number of times per day equal to the amount of mental focus invested in the implement, though invoking it doesn't expend any mental focus. Once the spirit type is selected for an implement, it cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>This ability alters implements.</p>\n<p><strong>Hauntist (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, a haunt collector with at least one haunted implement gains the medium's haunt channeler class feature (<em>Occult Adventures </em>31), with an effective medium level equal to his occultist level - 2.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces aura sight.</p>\n<p><strong>Spirit Speaker (Sp)</strong>: At 8th level, a haunt collector with at least one haunted implement can commune with the spirits once per day. By holding a seance for 10 minutes, he can ask questions of a destroyed undead or a neutralized or destroyed haunt. To use this ability on a corporeal undead, the haunt collector must have the creature's head in his possession. For a haunt or incorporeal undead, this seance must be held in the haunt's location or where the incorporeal undead was destroyed. Treat this ability as <em>speak with haunt</em>(ACG) or as <em>speak with dead </em>(but affecting only destroyed undead rather than only corpses), using the haunt collector's occultist level as the caster level. He can perform this seance one additional time per day at 12th level, and again at 16th level and 20th level.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces outside contact.</p>\n<p><strong>Extricate Haunt (Su)</strong>: The haunt collector can temporarily exorcise his haunted implements' possessing entities to spontaneously create phenomena similar to haunts and imbue them with spells the occultist knows. As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the haunt collector expends 1 point of mental focus to extricate an implement's spirit and infuse an adjacent square with its ghostly presence while granting it the power to deliver a spell from the implement's associated school (whose range is touch or greater) on the haunt collector's behalf. This action consumes the spell just as if it had been cast, but the energy is held in check by the created haunt until triggered by conditions set forth by the haunt collector. The conditions needed to trigger the haunt's spell effect must be clear, although they can be general, using the guidelines of the <em>magic mouth </em>spell. The haunt is stationary, and once the conditions for the trigger are met, the spell is discharged normally, though it now originates from the haunt's square.</p>\n<p>The haunt itself is an invisible, incorporeal, spectral force, similar to a stationary <em>unseen servant </em>with an undead aura for the purposes of spells such as <em>detect undead</em>. It has a number of hit points equal to the double the level of the spell used to create it + the occultist's Intelligence modifier. If triggered during the same combat it is created, the haunt acts at initiative count 10; otherwise, when the trigger occurs, the haunt initiates combat and acts at initiative count 10 on the surprise round. Other creatures must succeed at a Perception check (DC = 10 + the haunt collector's occultist level) to act in the surprise round. The haunt can be damaged by positive energy and anything else that can harm haunts, and if destroyed before it is triggered, it dissipates harmlessly. If the haunt is destroyed, it does not reform in its haunted implement until the occultist next invests his implements with mental focus. If the haunt doesn't trigger before the occultist next invests his implements with mental focus, the haunt dissolves at that point and reforms in its haunted implement.</p>\n<p>The haunt collector can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + his Intelligence modifier. While a haunting presence is extricated from its implement, the haunt collector does not receive the benefit of the implement's seance boon, nor can he call upon the implement's spirit bonus or use its focus powers, though he can still cast spells associated with the implement without penalty. If the spell is discharged successfully (rather than the haunt being destroyed), the spirit's presence returns to the haunt collector's implement the following round, and the seance boon and spirit bonus abilities are again available to the haunt collector.</p>\n<p>At 12th level, the haunt collector can create a free-roaming haunt by expending an additional point of mental focus, granting it a fly speed of 10 feet with good maneuverability, which allows it to change locations or seek targets, under the restrictions for trigger conditions as outlined above. If the haunt wanders beyond medium range (measured from the haunt collector's current position), it is instantly destroyed.</p>\n<p>At 16th level, the haunt collector can extricate an implement's spirit as a standard action.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces magic circles, binding circles, and fast circles.</p>\n<h1>Talisman Crafter (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Talisman crafters specialize in the creation of seals, constructing master talismans to use as implements and inscribing wards with esoteric geometry.</p>\n<p><strong>Talismanic Implements (Su)</strong>: The talisman crafter doesn't gain normal implements; rather, after refreshing her mental focus, she spends 1 hour crafting a number of small master talismans out of cast metal, parchment, wax, or wood, inscribing them with esoteric seals and investing them with power to serve as her implements for casting occultist spells of the schools she knows. The talisman crafter selects schools as normal (two at 1st level and an additional one at 2nd level and every 4 occultist levels thereafter). She creates one master talisman for each implement school she knows, unless she selected that implement school multiple times, in which case she needs one master talisman per time she has selected that school. The talisman crafter splits her mental focus among the schools she knows and generic focus as normal.</p>\n<p>This ability alters implements.</p>\n<p><strong>Spellbound Talisman (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a talisman crafter can inscribe spellbound talismans in addition to her master talismans, infusing small tokens she crafts with psychic spells she knows that normally affect one or more target creatures (but not spells that target the caster, spells that affect an area, spells that create effects, or other such spells). When the occultist infuses a talisman with one of her spells, she expends the spell slot just as if she had cast the spell and expends any material components necessary. The talisman crafter can hurl this prepared talisman as a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity and that requires the same thought and emotion components (<em>Occult Adventures </em>144) as the original spell. Even if she can normally throw objects without provoking an attack of opportunity, throwing a talisman still provokes an attack of opportunity unless she also succeeds at a concentration check to cast defensively. The thrown talisman has a range of 20 feet, and the occultist must succeed at a ranged touch attack to hit her target. If she hits the target, the spell affects it normally, and the creature receives the normal saving throw (if any) against the spell effect. This allows the talisman crafter to deliver touch spells at range through the spellbound talisman. Alternatively, the talisman crafter can touch the talisman to a target creature as a melee touch attack (for a willing target, she automatically hits); this attack doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity as long as she succeeds at a concentration check to cast defensively. If an inscribed talisman's spell would normally target more than one creature, its DC increases by 2.</p>\n<p>Only a talisman crafter can activate her spellbound talismans. Once created, a spellbound talisman remains potent until the next time the talisman crafter regains spell slots before losing its magic. Inscribing a spellbound talisman in this manner takes 1 minute of work.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces magic item skill and object reading.</p>\n<p><strong>Shared Talisman (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, a talisman crafter can expend 1 point of generic mental focus to create a spellbound talisman that anyone can activate. As long as the spellbound talisman exists, it continues to occupy one of the occultist's spell slots, but can be used by another creature to trigger its effects. Whoever triggers the effect, a shared talisman does not require thought or emotion components, and it doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity for casting a spell (though it still does so as normal if thrown).</p>\n<p>This ability replaces shift focus.</p>\n<p><strong>Warding Seal (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, a talisman crafter can inscribe a warding seal, infusing an inscribed glyph with psychic energy. Inscribing the seal follows the rules for drawing magic circles, takes 1 minute, and requires the occultist to expend 1 point of mental focus (either generic focus or focus from any one of her implements). As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the talisman crafter expends 1 point of mental focus to scribe a special seal, infusing the glyph with a psychic spell she knows that affects one or more creatures and expending the spell slot just as if she had cast the spell. This seal holds the spell energy in check until it's triggered by conditions set forth when the seal is crafted or until the occultist refreshes her mental focus. The seal functions as the spell glyph option of the <em>glyph of warding </em>spell. At 17th level, the talisman crafter's fast circles ability applies to her warding seals, and she treats the ability as the greater spell glyph option of the <em>greater glyph of warding </em>spell.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces aura sight and the focus powers normally gained at 5th and 17th levels.</p>\n<p>^Archetypes and Class Options Feats</p>"}

Scholars studying the behavior and organization of the unknown speculate they may have originally been fey creatures that somehow reached the Dimension of Dreams and became trapped there, remade by other minds likewise lost in ephemeral dreamscapes. The unknown propagate more of their own kind by eroding humanoids' psyches until the victims transform into new unknown. Unknown typically choose to victimize those who are already relatively helpless, especially children, but when they transform an accomplished adventurer into one of their own, the result can be truly terrifying.</p>\n<h1>CREATING AN UNKNOWN</h1>\n<p>\"Unknown\" is an acquired template for any humanoid. Unknown use the base creature abilities, except as noted.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Rating</strong>: Base creature's CR + 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Neutral evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Type</strong>: The creature's type changes to fey (augmented humanoid). Do not recalculate HD, BAB, or saves.</p>\n<p><strong>Senses</strong>: An unknown gains low-light vision.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class</strong>: Natural armor bonus improves by 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities</strong>: An unknown gains DR 10/cold iron.</p>\n<p><strong>Melee</strong>: An unknown gains two claw attacks (assuming the base creature has two hands). These claws deal 1d6 points of damage if the unknown is Medium (1d4 if Small).</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks</strong>: An unknown gains the following special attacks.</p>\n<p><em>Psyche Erosion (Su)</em>: Once per day, a target affected by an unknown's victimize ability that sees the unknown's true appearance must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the unknown's total Hit Dice + the unknown's Charisma modifier) or take 1d6 points of Charisma damage. A successful save negates the Charisma damage and also ends the unknown's victimize effect on that target. As long as a creature is the target of an unknown's victimize ability, it can't recover the ability damage from psyche erosion, even through magic. If the Charisma damage from psyche erosion is equal to the target's Charisma score, that creature doesn't recover ability score damage naturally even if it ceases being the target of victimize. Only magic can fully heal this ability damage.</p>\n<p>When its Charisma damage is equal to its Charisma score, the target falls into a nightmare-filled catatonia where it continues to be followed by an unknown. This dream state lasts for 1d4 days, and at the end, the character awakes if its Charisma damage has been reduced to less than its Charisma score. If not, the creature immediately loses all sense of self, becoming an unknown thrall. It replaces its Charisma score with the unknown's Charisma score, and no longer takes Charisma damage from exposure to the unknown. Over time, typically 1 to 2 weeks, the thrall becomes a new unknown, gaining this template.</p>\n<p>The unknown can share its senses with any of its thralls (even if it changes the target of its victimize ability), and as a full-round action, it can assume control of a thrall's body, as per <em>possession</em>(OA). Typically, an unknown uses this ability to keep the thrall close by until it becomes an unknown. Unknowns often use thralls to lure new victims to its lair.</p>\n<p>Psyche erosion is a mind-affecting effect. If your game uses the sanity system (see page 12), the erosion deals 2d6 points of sanity damage instead of Charisma damage, and triggers the catatonia and the transformation into a thrall if the victim's sanity damage is equal to or exceeds the target's sanity.</p>\n<p><em>Victimize (Su)</em>: As a swift action, an unknown can target a single creature within line of sight with this ability. After designating a target, the unknown can't change the target of this ability for 24 hours, or until the target dies or succeeds at its save against the unknown's psyche erosion ability. An unknown always knows the exact location of a victimized creature and the shortest route to reach it, even if it is on another plane (similar to a combined <em>discern location </em>and <em>find the path</em>); this is a divination effect and can only be prevented by <em>mind blank </em>and similar effects. A creature can be the target of only one unknown's victimize ability at a time, and an unknown can victimize only one creature at a time.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell-Like Abilities</strong>: An unknown can use <em>blur</em>, <em>ghost sound</em>, <em>ventriloquism</em>, and <em>vocal alteration</em>(UM) (self only) as spell-like abilities at will, with a caster level equal to its Hit Dice.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong>: An unknown gains Aklo as a bonus language. It can't speak except by using its <em>ventriloquism </em>spell-like ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Qualities</strong>: An unknown gains the following.</p>\n<p><em>Assume Likeness (Su)</em>: As a standard action while using hallucinatory camouflage, an unknown is able to disguise itself as a specific creature known to the target of its victimize ability. If the victimized creature succeeds at a Will save (at the same DC as in psyche erosion) it negates this effect, and the unknown can't use this ability again for 24 hours or until it changes victims, whichever comes first. Otherwise, the unknown's features and mannerisms change to match the creature known to its victim, granting it a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate this creature.</p>\n<p>Unlike hallucinatory camouflage, this ability works against the target of victimize. This is a mind-affecting illusion (glamer) effect.</p>\n<p><em>Dream Movements (Su)</em>: To the unknown, all worlds are tinted with the shades of nightmares from the Dimension of Dreams, allowing them to defy the laws of physics as they move as if in a dream. An unknown gains an insight bonus to AC equal to its Charisma bonus. It can travel as if by <em>dimension door </em>as a move action at will, but only to enter or leave an area within line of sight of the target of its victimize ability. The victimized creature and the intended destination must both be within long range of the unknown.</p>\n<p><em>Hallucinatory Camouflage (Su)</em>: As long as an unknown is targeting a creature with its victimize ability, it hides its appearance behind a veil of illusions, appearing to be an unremarkable member of the victimized creature's race to everyone except the target of victimize. A successful Will save (at the same DC as psyche erosion) allows a creature that interacts with the illusion to disbelieve the effect. This is a mind-affecting illusion (glamer) effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Scores</strong>: +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, +4 Charisma.</p>\n<p>^Bestiary Horrific Inspirations</p>"}

Chapter 1: Horror Characters}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The waves call to you, like a siren's song echoing across crashing surf.</p>\n<h1>Catalyst</h1>\n<p>The corruption of the deep ones typically comes in two varieties. The most common source of deep one corruption is having dormant deep one blood running through your veins. Exposure to the magic of cults dedicated to Great Old Ones like Cthulhu could awaken this dormant lineage within you, beginning your transformation into a deep one. Likewise, exposure to the presence of deep ones themselves can cause you to heed a call to deep waters that ends with a torturous transformation. Less common means of contracting a deep one corruption include ritualistic transformation, curses, or-in extreme cases-willing copulation with a deep one.</p>\n<h1>Progression</h1>\n<p>Once the deep one corruption has taken root, the summons calling you to the deep ones' cold, lightless realm becomes a constant thrum in the back of your mind. Exposure to sea water becomes increasingly important to you. Each day that you don't spend at least 1 hour per manifestation level fully immersed in the ocean or a salt-water sea, you must succeed at a Will save (DC = 15 + your manifestation level). You also need to attempt such a Will save whenever you are a target of (or in the area of ) a divine spell or spell-like ability with the evil descriptor.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 1</strong>: The first time you fail, you lose control of yourself for 24 hours. When you regain your senses, you find yourself in the sea or an ocean, or at least on your way to such a place if you were too far away to reach it.</p>\n<p>Either way, your alignment shifts one step towards chaotic evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 2</strong>: The second time you fail, you lose control again, and you find that you have made contact with an alien entity during the missing time. Your alignment shifts to chaotic evil and your race changes to deep one hybrid (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 5 </em>70), if it wasn't already. If you are already over the venerable age for a deep one hybrid (60 years), you experience the final change as per the race's ability, becoming an NPC deep one under the GM's control.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 3</strong>: The third time you fail, you experience the final change early, becoming an NPC deep one under the GM's control.</p>\n<h1>Removing the Corruption</h1>\n<p>Removing the deep one corruption might require psychic conditioning away from compulsions regarding water and necromantic rituals to expunge the deep one blood from your veins. The ritual might also require slaying the deep one who sired your bloodline.</p>\n<h1>Manifestations</h1>\n<p>The following are manifestations of the deep one corruption.</p>\n<h1>Bloodthirst</h1>\n<p>You gain a bite attack and can taste blood in the water.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Deep adaptation*, loathsome gills*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain a bite attack as a primary natural weapon. This bite attack deals 1d6 points of damage if your size is Medium (1d4 if Small). Additionally, you gain the scent ability when underwater and can track a creature that travels underwater using a Perception check rather than a Survival check, so long as it was bleeding (either suffering from a bleed effect or having taken at least 1 point of piercing or slashing damage that was neither healed nor treated with a successful Heal check).</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Your toothy maw distorts your speech, and your thoughts flit between potential prey. You take a 15% spell failure chance for spells with verbal or thought (<em>Occult Adventures </em>144) components and a -2 penalty on all Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Handle Animal, and Perform checks.</p>\n<h1>Call of the Deep</h1>\n<p>Your slimy touch robs your victims of breath.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 7th, claws of the deep*, swimmer in the deep*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Once per day for every 2 manifestation levels you possess, you can attempt a touch attack that causes your opponent to suffocate. If this attack hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or it gains the ability to breathe water, but also immediately loses the ability to breathe air and begins to suffocate unless it holds its breath. This effect lasts for a number of minutes equal to your manifestation level, and after each minute, the victim can attempt another Fortitude save to negate the effect. The DC of the save increases by 2 every minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You require constant submersion in salt water. If you spend more than 1 day without fully submerging yourself in such water, you suffer internal organ failure, painful cracking of the skin, and death within 4d6 hours.</p>\n<h1>Claws of the Deep</h1>\n<p>Disgusting, translucent claws grow from your fingers.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 3rd, swimmer in the deep*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain two claw natural attacks. These claws deal 1d4 points of damage if your size is Medium (1d3 if Small).</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You exude a strong odor of low tide. This allows creatures with the scent ability to notice you from twice the usual distance, and makes it extremely difficult-and sometimes outright impossible-to disguise yourself. You also take a -4 penalty on your Diplomacy and Perform checks against creatures without the aquatic subtype. Your supernatural scent is not affected by the <em>negate aroma</em>(APG) spell.</p>\n<h1>Deep Adaptation</h1>\n<p>You are acclimated to deep ocean pressures and temperatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Loathsome gills*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain cold resistance 5. At manifestation level 6th, you can survive safely at any ocean depth.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Your flesh peels away to reveal fine, iridescent scales, and your movements become slow and awkward. You take a -2 penalty to your Dexterity score while on land.</p>\n<h1>Deepsight</h1>\n<p>Your eyes grow accustomed to the dark places of the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain low-light vision. At manifestation level 5th, you gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet, or if you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Your eyes' reflective sheen causes light sensitivity.</p>\n<h1>Landwalker</h1>\n<p>Your journey to the depths presaged your return to dry land.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Manifestation level 7th, loathsome gills*.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain the aquatic subtype and the amphibious special quality. You gain a swim speed equal to half your land speed. If you have the swimmer in the deep manifestation, increase your swim speed by 10 feet instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Your hair falls out in patches and your skin takes on a slimy sheen. You take a -2 penalty to your Charisma score.</p>\n<h1>Loathsome Gills</h1>\n<p>You grow gills at your jawline.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You can hold your breath underwater for 10 minutes per point of Constitution you have. At manifestation level 3rd, you can breathe underwater indefinitely. At manifestation level 7th, you can no longer breathe air and must hold your breath when above water (though you can still hold your breath for 10 minutes per point of Constitution you have).</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Your gills impose a -4 penalty on Fortitude saves against inhaled poisons and poison effects (like <em>stinking cloud</em>).</p>\n<h1>Siltsight</h1>\n<p>Your senses are keener underwater.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: While underwater, you ignore concealment from silt, muck, and murky water. At manifestation level 5th, you also gain blindsense with a range of 10 feet while underwater.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Your eyes grow bulbous and fishlike. You take a -2 penalty on Perception checks while not underwater.</p>\n<h1>Slow Aging</h1>\n<p>Your deep one blood runs thick and slowly, arresting aging.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Manifestation level 5th.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You age more slowly than members of your base race. It takes you twice as long to reach middle age, and three times as long to reach both old age and venerable. At manifestation level 8th, you gain a +2 bonus to your Constitution score.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You dream of lost cities in ages primordial and are haunted by strange aeons long since forgotten. You require 16 hours of sleep for a night's rest and you are incapable of deriving benefit from effects that replace the need for sleep (like a <em>ring of sustenance</em>) or ameliorate, suppress, or remove the effects of lack of sleep.</p>\n<h1>Swimmer in the Deep</h1>\n<p>The cold depths of the ocean are your home now.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain a +4 racial bonus on Swim checks (which doesn't stack with the +8 racial bonus from having a swim speed) and can take a 10 on Swim checks even while threatened. At manifestation level 3rd, you gain a swim speed equal to half your land speed. At manifestation level 5th, your swim speed is equal to your land speed.</p>\n<p>If you are a deep one hybrid (<em>Bestiary </em>5 70), you instead gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to your swim speed. This increases to a +20-foot enhancement bonus at manifestation level 3rd and to a +30-foot enhancement bonus at manifestation level 5th.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You grow webbing between your fingers and toes and become dissatisfied with life on land. You take a -2 penalty on Dexterity- and Strength-based skill checks and ability checks while on land.</p>"}

Chapter 5: Horror Rules","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<p>Haunts are the echoes of tormented spirits that linger in locations keyed to their suffering-and they have proven to be a favorite challenge in many adventures. The <em>Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide </em>introduced rules for haunts and those rules are expanded in <em>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</em>. This section introduces new elements to add to haunts, as well as variants that expand the haunt rules to apply to corrupted or twisted regions that are not tied to undeath. It also provides examples of variant haunts and a set of new haunts for every CR from 1/4 through 20. In the haunt stat blocks that follow, new rules elements presented in this chapter are marked with an asterisk (*).</p>\n<h1>HAUNT ELEMENTS</h1>\n<p>The new haunt elements in this section are templates that can be applied to any haunt.</p>\n<h1>Elusive Haunt (CR +1 or +2)</h1>\n<p>A typical haunt can be harmed within the area of its manifestation, but an elusive haunt's source is in a separate location. An elusive haunt can be damaged only at its source, and can manifest far away from that source, up to 100 feet per point of CR. The elusive element typically increases a haunt's CR by 1. If the haunt is also persistent, the elusive property increases the haunt's CR by 2.</p>\n<h1>Latent Haunt (CR +0)</h1>\n<p>A latent haunt's effects are subtle and come into effect only if a creature who fails a save against the haunt fulfills a particular condition, such as visiting a certain location or performing a specific action. For example, a latent haunt may rest among the graves of victims of a serial killer, and only demonstrate its effects if the affected creature enters the killer's manor. Latent haunts affecting a creature treat that creature as their source, and can be detected and damaged by any means that would detect or damage the haunt. A latent haunt works best if the DC of the skill check to notice it is unusually high for its CR.</p>\n<h1>Tenacious Haunt (CR +1)</h1>\n<p>A tenacious haunt clings desperately to its existence. When the haunt is required to attempt a saving throw, instead of automatically failing, it can attempt a saving throw with a bonus equal to 2 + its CR.</p>\n<h1>Unyielding Haunt (CR +2)</h1>\n<p>An unyielding haunt has all of the properties of a tenacious haunt, except when it succeeds at a saving throw against a spell or effect that would normally deal it damage, it instead takes no damage.</p>\n<h1>VARIANT HAUNTS</h1>\n<p>Haunts that are not tied to undeath are not vulnerable to positive energy, and cannot be detected with spells such as <em>detect undead </em>or evaded with spells such as <em>hide from undead</em>. They have their own sets of vulnerabilities and defenses.</p>\n<h1>Dimensional Instabilities</h1>\n<p>Dimensional instabilities are areas where the boundary between the Material Plane and another plane is thin and rifts between the planes frequently open. They take damage from effects that oppose the connected plane's fundamental nature. For example, a dimensional instability associated with the chaotic evil Abyss takes damage from good or lawful spells or effects, and an instability tied to the Elemental Plane of Fire takes damage from water and cold effects. Instabilities can even provide benefits to those who know how to cultivate them.</p>\n<p>The sample haunt appeared when an ancient wizard bound 666 demons. Over time, the boundary between the Abyss and his summoning chamber grew thin, and the plane's influence fractured the binding circle he carved into the floor, creating tiny rifts that flicker into existence at irregular intervals.</p>\n<p>In addition to good and lawful effects, the haunt is vulnerable to other damage associated with good or law at the GM's discretion, such as the extra damage from a <em>holy </em>weapon<em>. </em></p>\n<h1>SPAWN OF THE ABYSS CR 11</h1>\n<p><strong>XP 12,800 </strong></p>\n<p>CE persistent vaporous(OA) variant haunt (40-ft. radius)</p>\n<p><strong><strong>AURA</strong> </strong>strong conjuration</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level </strong>13th</p>\n<p><strong>Notice </strong>Perception or Knowledge (arcana) DC 25 (to notice a faint shimmering or recognize the significance of the fractured circle)</p>\n<p><strong>hp </strong>49; <strong>Weakness </strong>good and lawful effects (immune to positive energy); <strong>Trigger </strong>proximity; <strong>Reset </strong>1d20 days</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>When a mortal creature enters the area, it's presence provokes curiosity from the other side.

If she succeeds, she gains the fiendish template for 24 hours, and her alignment shifts one step closer to chaotic evil. If she fails, she is pulled into the Abyss.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction </strong>The instability can only be permanently closed with a <em>miracle </em>or <em>wish </em>spell. A <em>hallow </em>spell tied to a dimensional anchor can temporarily prevent the instability's effects.</p>\n<h1>Maddening Influence</h1>\n<p>These haunts are tied to the reality-warping influence of beings beyond comprehension. The only way to hold these haunts at bay is to draw upon dark knowledge, but such knowledge comes at a cost. As a full-round action, any character within the haunt's area can attempt an appropriate Knowledge check to perform a short rite, utter an arcane word, or otherwise quell the maddening influence (DC = 15 + the haunt's CR). If successful, the haunt takes 5 points of damage plus additional damage equal to the amount the character exceeded the DC.</p>\n<p>The whispers from beyond haunt detailed below is an example of a maddening influence formed at the site of a mass ritual suicide. The murmurs worm their way into the minds of all who hear them and leave lasting wounds.</p>\n<h1>WHISPER FROM BEYOND CR 10</h1>\n<p><strong>XP 9,600 </strong></p>\n<p>CE free-roaming(OA) persistent variant haunt (30-ft. radius)</p>\n<p><strong>Caster </strong>Level 9th</p>\n<p><strong>Notice </strong>Perception DC 25 (to hear whispers emerging from inside the skulls of all nearby creatures)</p>\n<p><strong>hp </strong>45; <strong>Weakness </strong>harmed by Knowledge (arcana, planes, or religion) DC 25 (immune to positive energy); <strong>Trigger </strong>proximity; <strong>Reset </strong>1 day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The whispers drift toward sentient beings, particularly those whose minds they have touched before. Each creature in the area must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or take 1d8 points of Wisdom damage, or 1 Wisdom damage on a successful save (or if you are using the sanity system, 1d6 points of sanity damage on a successful save or 2d8 points on a failed save; see page 12). The DC increases by 1 for each round a creature spends within the haunt's area (these rounds need not be consecutive, though a given creature's DC resets to 16 after 24 hours and whenever the haunt is dispersed). Each time a creature damages this haunt, it must succeed at a Will save with a DC equal to its Knowledge check result or take 1d4 Wisdom drain (or, if you are using the sanity system, 1d8 points of sanity damage on a successful save or 2d10 points on a failed save).</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction </strong>The haunt is destroyed if the corpses of all the cultists who created it are cremated and buried on consecrated ground.</p>\n<h1>Magical Scars</h1>\n<p>Each spell, no matter how weak, leaves its signature on the world for a short time, which spellcasters can perceive as a lingering magical aura. When dozens of powerful spells are hurled against each other over a small area, reality itself can form scars that affect all who come near them.</p>\n<p>Magical scars have auras and count as ongoing spell effects for the purposes of <em>detect magic </em>and similar spells. A successful Spellcraft check to identify a scar reveals its effect and its weakness, and, if it succeeds by 10 or more, the scar's benefit. A creature can't attempt to activate a benefit it hasn't identified. Spells that automatically reveal the nature of magical effects, such as <em>greater arcane sight</em>, automatically reveal all of these properties. The destruction conditions for magical scars are more obscure, and require research or exploration to uncover.</p>\n<p>The arcane storm haunt arose when a pair of evokers dueled to the death centuries ago. An echo of the duel still rages at the site of their battle, and the charred ground tells the bitter tale.</p>\n<h1>ARCANE STORM CR 6</h1>\n<p><strong>XP 2,400 </strong></p>\n<p>N persistent variant haunt (30-ft. radius)</p>\n<p><strong><strong>AURA</strong> </strong>faint evocation</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level </strong>5th</p>\n<p><strong>Notice </strong>Perception or Spellcraft DC 20 (to hear the sound of clashing energy or deduce the effect from the charred ground)</p>\n<p><strong>hp </strong>27; <strong>Weakness </strong>energy damage (immune to positive energy); <strong>Trigger </strong>proximity; <strong>Reset </strong>1 day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>Each round, the arcane storm fires a bolt of energy to hit as many creatures as possible in its area (Reflex DC 15 halves). This functions as per <em>lightning bolt</em>, except the energy type cycles between acid, cold, electricity, and fire. The storm is immune to the most recent type of energy damage it has dealt.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit </strong>A character who fails the save against one of the arcane storm's bolts and does not reduce the damage in any way (such as energy resistance) can attempt a DC 16 Will save to harness a fraction of the storm's power. A character who harnesses the storm's power gains 5 charges. He can spend 1 charge as a free action to add 1d6 points of damage of the same energy type as that of the channeled bolt to either an evocation spell that deals damage matching any of the storm's four energy types or to a natural attack or unarmed strike. A creature can gain charges from the arcane storm only once.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction </strong>The arcane storm is destroyed if a character successfully counterspells four of its bolts in a row.</p>\n<h1>Psychic Haunts</h1>\n<p>Sometimes, the collective emotional energy of significant or traumatic events creates a lasting psychic impression, even in places not associated with death. These psychic haunts are mind-affecting emotion effects. A character who uses <em>analyze aura </em>(<em>Occult Adventures </em>156) or the read aura skill unlock (<em>Occult Adventures </em>197) on a psychic haunt's area automatically detects the haunt and receives cryptic clues about how to put it to rest.</p>\n<p>Every psychic haunt focuses on a specific emotion, and when targeted by or within the area of effect of an emotion spell or effect that is not connected to the associated emotion, they take damage equal to three times the effect's spell level (each spell deals damage to the haunt once, regardless of its duration). <em>Calm emotions </em>damages psychic haunts regardless of their associated emotion, and an emotion effect without a spell level deals an amount of damage equal to the HD of the creature who created the effect. A character can calm a psychic haunt with a Diplomacy check (DC = 15 + the haunt's CR). If successful, the haunt takes 5 points of damage plus additional damage equal to the amount the character exceeded the DC.</p>\n<p>The psychic echo below lies in the heart of an abandoned village. A group of raiders drove the villagers from their home by the sword, but an echo of the villagers' fury persists, stoking hatred against all members of the raiders' ethnic group.</p>\n<h1>PSYCHIC ECHO (ANGER) CR 10</h1>\n<p><strong>XP 9,600 </strong></p>\n<p>N persistent variant haunt (30-ft. radius)</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level </strong>11th</p>\n<p><strong>Notice </strong>Sense Motive DC 25 (to sense an internal spark of anger)</p>\n<p><strong>hp </strong>45; <strong>Weakness </strong>emotion effects and <em>calm emotions </em>(immune to positive energy); <strong>Trigger </strong>proximity; <strong>Reset </strong>1 day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>As per <em>foster hatred </em>(<em>Occult Adventures </em>172), except any creature that fails a DC 19 Will save becomes hostile toward members of the raiders' ethnic group.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction </strong>To destroy the haunt, two people, one each of the villagers' and raiders' ethnicity must reveal their true love for one another (typically by marrying) within the haunt's area.</p>\n<h1>NEW HAUNTS</h1>\n<p>The following haunts draw upon haunt elements from <em>Occult Adventures </em>and this book.</p>\n<h1>Bloody Handprints</h1>\n<p>A murder or other violent death lingers as bloody marks that harm any creature touching the surface on which they appear.</p>\n<h1>BLOODY HANDPRINTS CR 1/4</h1>\n<p><strong>XP 100 </strong></p>\n<p>NE haunt (surface with an area up to a 5-ft. square)</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level </strong>1st</p>\n<p><strong>Notice </strong>Perception DC 5 (to see dried bloody prints on the surface)</p>\n<p><strong>hp </strong>1; <strong>Trigger </strong>touch; <strong>Reset </strong>1 day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>Bloody handprints slowly appear on the surface. Anyone touching the surface takes 1d6 points of damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction </strong>The bloody handprints vanish if the surface is thoroughly cleaned and scrubbed with holy water.</p>\n<h1>Scratching Behind the Wall</h1>\n<p>A lord with a terrible secret caught a servant snooping through his papers. He knocked the servant over the head and threw her into a disused dumbwaiter, which he jammed between floors. The servant awoke the following day, and her desperate attempts to escape infuse the walls that contained her.</p>\n<h1>SCRATCHING BEHIND THE WALL CR 1/2</h1>\n<p><strong>XP 200 </strong></p>\n<p>CE haunt (5-ft.-by-10-ft. hallway)</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level </strong>1st</p>\n<p><strong>Notice </strong>Perception DC 15 (to hear a faint scream behind the wall)</p>\n<p><strong>hp </strong>1; <strong>Trigger </strong>proximity; <strong>Reset </strong>1 day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The sound of claws scraping on the inside of the wall echoes throughout the hallway. Creatures within its area must succeed at a DC 11 Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction </strong>A character who finds the servant's body and removes her from behind the wall destroys the haunt forever.</p>\n<h1>Cold Spot</h1>\n<p>Cold spots are echoes of spirits too weak to manifest as ghosts. They can occur alone or cluster around significant areas.</p>\n<h1>COLD SPOT CR 1</h1>\n<p><strong>XP 400 </strong></p>\n<p>NE haunt (5-ft. radius)</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level </strong>1st</p>\n<p><strong>Notice </strong>Perception DC 20 (to feel the temperature dropping)</p>\n<p><strong>hp </strong>2; <strong>Weakness </strong>fire (these effects can damage this haunt); <strong>Trigger </strong>proximity; <strong>Reset </strong>1 day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The temperature suddenly plummets below freezing. All creatures within the radius are affected as if they had been outside in cold weather for 1 hour, taking 1d6 points of nonlethal damage unless they succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save. The cold temperature lingers for 10 minutes, but has no additional mechanical effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction </strong>If the cold spot is destroyed with holy fire (such as with <em>flame strike</em>), it never returns.</p>\n<h1>Spectral Screams</h1>\n<p>Some spirits take joy in terrifying the living. Spectral screams are collections of lesser spirits who have banded together to increase the amount of terror they can spread.</p>\n<h1>SPECTRAL SCREAMS CR 2</h1>\n<p><strong>XP 600 </strong></p>\n<p>NE haunt (10-ft. radius)</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level </strong>3rd</p>\n<p><strong>Notice </strong>Perception DC 10 (to hear the moaning spirits approaching)</p>\n<p><strong>hp </strong>4; <strong>Weakness </strong>Intimidate; <strong>Trigger </strong>proximity; <strong>Reset </strong>1 hour</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>Spectral forms of disembodied heads emerge from the floor and scream at everyone in the area, their jaws distending to an impossible width. Creatures are affected by <em>scare</em>. The spectral heads take pride in terrorizing their victims; if a creature succeeds at a DC 16 Intimidate check to demonstrate its own frightening nature, the spirits decide the PC is the true winner of the current contest, after which they lose interest in the PCs for 1 hour as if reduced to 0 hit points.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction </strong>The spectral screams haunt is destroyed if a creature spends 8 consecutive hours sleeping in its area.</p>\n<h1>Foreboding Mist</h1>\n<p>Foreboding mists lurk in ill-kept graveyards, drawing their substance from the unrest of all who are buried below. They manifest regardless of the weather, and target the minds of those who fail to recognize they are not entirely real.</p>\n<h1>FOREBODING MIST CR 3</h1>\n<p><strong>XP 800 </strong></p>\n<p>NE persistent haunt (15-ft. radius)</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level </strong>3rd</p>\n<p><strong>Notice </strong>Perception DC 15 (to notice a chill fog forming)</p>\n<p><strong>hp </strong>13; <strong>Weakness </strong>slow; <strong>Trigger </strong>proximity; <strong>Reset </strong>1 hour</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>A chilly fog descends, twisting and condensing into claws that grab and prod those within it. This fog functions as per <em>haunting mists</em>(UM) (DC 13).</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction </strong>Casting <em>consecrate </em>on the ground underneath the mist prevents it from returning.</p>\n<h1>Buried Alive</h1>\n<p>The spirits of those unfortunate souls who are buried alive sometimes clamber to force others to share their fate.</p>\n<h1>BURIED ALIVE CR 4</h1>\n<p><strong>XP 1,200 </strong></p>\n<p>NE persistent haunt (15-ft. radius)</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level </strong>5th</p>\n<p><strong>Notice </strong>Perception DC 20 (to hear a shovel cleaving through dirt)</p>\n<p><strong>hp </strong>18; <strong>Trigger </strong>proximity; <strong>Reset </strong>1 day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>On the first round, spectral gravediggers create a single 15-foot-deep pit covering the haunt's entire radius. Creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex saving throw or fall to the bottom of the pit, taking 2d6 points of damage. Creatures who succeed leap to a square at the edge of the pit. The walls of the pit are uneven (Climb DC 20). On the second round, the spectral gravediggers fill the pit with loose, spectral dirt, burying everyone still inside. Buried creatures are pinned, but they can reduce their condition to grappled with a successful DC 15 Strength check. They take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage each minute, and begin to suffocate after 10 minutes. Creatures outside of the pit can dig out the buried creatures. Each 5-foot cube of spectral dirt weighs 1,000 pounds; a creature can move 5 times her maximum load worth of dirt per minute, or 10 times her maximum load if she has a shovel. If the haunt is dispersed, buried creatures automatically rise to the surface.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction </strong>The haunt can be permanently destroyed if a character finds the bones of the person who was buried alive, exhumes them, coats them in holy water, and reburies them in a temple of their patron deity.</p>\n<h1>Belated Arrival</h1>\n<p>The regret of those who arrived too late to spare others a terrible fate can manifest as a haunt. A belated arrival haunt often arises near another haunt or undead, representing the fate that these regretful spirits were not fast enough to stop. A belated arrival haunt is often chained to a ghost (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </em>144) but a necrocraft (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 </em>200) is a truly horrifying alternative.</p>\n<h1>BELATED ARRIVAL CR 5</h1>\n<p><strong>XP 1,600 </strong></p>\n<p>N chained(OA) haunt (25-ft. radius)</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level </strong>9th</p>\n<p><strong>Notice </strong>Perception DC 20 (to hear running footsteps)</p>\n<p><strong>hp </strong>22; <strong>Weakness </strong>slow; <strong>Trigger </strong>proximity; <strong>Reset </strong>1 day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The spectral forms of several people take faltering steps before falling to their knees and wailing with grief. All creatures in the area are exhausted (no save, as per <em>waves of exhaustion</em>) and are slowed for 13 minutes as per <em>slow </em>unless they succeed at a DC 16 Will saving throw.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction </strong>These spirits find rest only if those they could not save lead them to the afterlife.</p>\n<h1>Unsolved Murder</h1>\n<p>After a merchant was murdered at a party being held to celebrate his latest venture, his spirit was obsessed with finding his killer and exacting vengeance. It has clung to his body for years, hoping for a hapless grave robber to inadvertently become the pawn of his unfinished business.</p>\n<h1>UNSOLVED MURDER CR 6</h1>\n<p><strong>XP 2,400 </strong></p>\n<p>NE latent* persistent possessing(OA) haunt (up to a 30-ft. radius)</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level </strong>6th</p>\n<p><strong>Notice </strong>Perception DC 25 (to notice the corpse's hand twitching)</p>\n<p><strong>hp </strong>27; <strong>Trigger </strong>touch; <strong>Reset </strong>1 week</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The merchant's spirit subtly possesses the creature who touched his corpse (even if the creature touched it with a tool), as per <em>riding possession</em>(OA) (Will DC 17 negates), except he and the host can communicate telepathically. He nudges his host toward investigating his murder. On any day his host makes progress, he is pleased and grants his host a +2 morale bonus on skill checks. If his host does not make progress for 1 week, he curses his host in a fit of rage. This functions as per <em>bestow curse </em>(Will DC 16 negates), except the spirit can remove it whenever he chooses. He can apply one new curse per week.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction </strong>The merchant's spirit can rest only if the murderer dies in an act of revenge. If the murderer dies of other causes before this can happen, the merchant's spirit demands another form of harsh vengeance against the murderer's memory or family.</p>\n<h1>Betrayal</h1>\n<p>When the sting of betrayal lingers beyond the grave, it can manifest as a disjointed mass of confused and paranoid spiritual energy that can turn even the closest of allies against one another.</p>\n<h1>BETRAYAL CR 7</h1>\n<p><strong>XP 3,200 </strong></p>\n<p>CE persistent haunt (30-ft. radius)</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level </strong>7th</p>\n<p><strong>Notice </strong>Perception or Sense Motive DC 20 (to see the outlines of a dozen cloaked figures begin to form or feel a sudden sense of suspicion)</p>\n<p><strong>hp </strong>31; <strong>Trigger </strong>proximity; <strong>Reset </strong>1 day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>As dozens of cloaked figures swarm the area, the line between friend and foe blurs, and paranoia descends upon everyone within the haunt's area, as per <em>confusion </em>(Will DC 15 negates). Furthermore, creatures within the haunt's area must attempt a DC 15 Will saving throw against the haunt's curse. Until it is removed, the curse forces its victims to attempt saving throws against spells, including those designated harmless. Additionally, the victims cannot benefit from any effect that requires them to treat another creature as an ally, such as flanking or aid another. <em>Remove curse </em>can remove this effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction </strong>The betrayal haunt is destroyed if a victim falls unconscious or dies because of damage it took on behalf of another creature in the area. Any spell or ability that allows for the transfer of damage, such as <em>shield other </em>or a life oracle's lifelink ability (<em>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide </em>49), satisfies this haunt's requirement. This doesn't work if the characters in question colluded to manufacture the damage transfer to destroy the haunt; it works only if it was a truly selfless act of protecting another.</p>\n<h1>Watery Grave</h1>\n<p>Watery grave haunts typically travel aboard ghost ships, protecting the ghost vessel's passengers. When the ghost ship's captain boards an enemy vessel, the watery grave haunt drifts aboard as well.</p>\n<h1>WATERY GRAVE CR 8</h1>\n<p><strong>XP 4,800 </strong></p>\n<p>CE chained(OA) free-roaming(OA) persistent haunt (one ship, up to a 40-ft. radius)</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level </strong>9th</p>\n<p><strong>Notice </strong>Perception DC 20 (to hear bubbles rising to the surface of the water)</p>\n<p><strong>hp </strong>36; <strong>Trigger </strong>proximity; <strong>Reset </strong>1 day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>A ghostly tendril of water erupts from the sea and forces itself into the lungs of a living creature aboard the ship, which then begins to drown. This functions as per <em>suffocation</em>(APG) (Fortitude DC 17 negates). The haunt affects one additional victim each round until it is dispersed.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction </strong>The watery grave haunt is destroyed if the ghost ship's captain is permanently destroyed.</p>\n<h1>Devouring Maws</h1>\n<p>A pack of ravenous ghouls descended upon a once-peaceful town, killing or transforming all of its denizens who were not fast enough to flee. The ghouls' unending hunger blended with the townsfolk's horrifying memories of death to produce the devouring maws haunt.</p>\n<h1>DEVOURING MAWS CR 9</h1>\n<p><strong>XP 6,400 </strong></p>\n<p>CE persistent haunt (30-ft. radius)</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level </strong>9th</p>\n<p><strong>Notice </strong>Perception DC 20 (to hear teeth scraping against bone)</p>\n<p><strong>hp </strong>40; <strong>Trigger </strong>proximity; <strong>Reset </strong>1 day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>A swarm of disembodied mouths fills the area. Each humanoid creature in the area must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or be paralyzed, as per <em>mass hold person</em>. The maws swarm around paralyzed creatures, dealing them 4d6 points of damage per round. Elves are immune to the effects of this haunt.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction </strong>Living (though not necessarily sentient) creatures with a combined <strong>WEIGHT</strong> of at least 10,000 pounds must be left in the area to be devoured over the course of a single day.</p>\n<h1>Living Decay</h1>\n<p>Among the most frightening diseases are those that cause their victims' bodies to rot away. A living decay haunt arises when an epidemic of such a disease devastates a population. This haunt uses the optional disease rules presented on pages 138-139 of <em>Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained. </em></p>\n<h1>LIVING DECAY CR 10</h1>\n<p><strong>XP 9,600 </strong></p>\n<p>NE persistent haunt (50-ft. radius)</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level </strong>9th</p>\n<p><strong>Notice </strong>Perception DC 20 (to smell decaying flesh)</p>\n<p><strong>hp </strong>45; <strong>Weakness </strong><em>remove disease</em>; <strong>Trigger </strong>proximity; <strong>Reset </strong>1 day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The area fills with a potent miasma that reeks of decaying flesh. Everyone within the radius must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or contract the disease living rot, as detailed below, except they bypass the latent/carrier state. Within the haunt's area, the disease's frequency increases to 1 round and its save DC increases to 20. Characters who succeed at this saving throw are not immune; they must attempt a new saving throw each round they remain in the haunt's area. Reducing the haunt to 0 hit points does not remove the disease. A character who casts <em>remove disease </em>on the living decay haunt deals it an amount of damage equal to her caster level.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction </strong>Casting <em>heal </em>on each remaining body in the original victims' mass grave (or a single casting of <em>mass heal</em>) prevents this haunt from returning.</p>\n<h1>LIVING ROT</h1>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>disease, contact, inhaled, or injury; <strong>Save </strong>Fortitude DC 17</p>\n<p><strong>Track </strong>physical; <strong>Frequency </strong>1/day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>In the weakened state, the target also takes a -2 penalty on Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks and ability checks. In the impaired state, the target takes a 50% miss chance on attack rolls and the target's speed is reduced by half (minimum 5 feet). All objects touched at the impaired state and beyond can transfer the disease; <em>Cure </em>2 consecutive saves,penalties from the weakened state and worse are permanent until the victim is the target of <em>heal </em>or <em>regenerate</em></p>\n<h1>Eternal Pyre</h1>\n<p>An eternal pyre is formed from the spirits of people who were burned alive during an overzealous witch trial. It hates all living beings, but it has a strong bond of kinship with the witchfire (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 </em>284) who arose from the most powerful of those spirits. The witchfire often lurks within the haunt's area, as her witchflame intensifies the power of the pyre's strikes, which in turn heal her.</p>\n<h1>ETERNAL PYRE CR 11</h1>\n<p><strong>XP 12,800 </strong></p>\n<p>CE chained(OA) fast(OA) free-roaming(OA) persistent spiteful(OA) tenacious* haunt (30-ft. radius)</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level </strong>11th</p>\n<p><strong>Notice </strong>Perception DC 20 (to hear the crackling of a fire)</p>\n<p><strong>hp </strong>49; <strong>Weakness </strong>water spells and effects (these effects damage the haunt); <strong>Trigger </strong>proximity; <strong>Reset </strong>1 day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>A pillar of black and red flames manifests within the haunt's area each round. This pillar functions as per <em>flame strike </em>(Reflex DC 19 negates), except its damage is half fire and half negative energy.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction </strong>Destroying the witchfire also destroys the eternal pyre haunt.</p>\n<h1>Dissolving Vat</h1>\n<p>A sadistic alchemist conducted experiments on test subjects within his remote laboratory. When he was finished with his subjects, he threw them into a vat of harsh chemicals to dissolve. His victims' spirits have permeated the vat, and they reach out with their oozing spectral forms toward any who come near.</p>\n<h1>DISSOLVING VAT CR 12</h1>\n<p><strong>XP 19,200 </strong></p>\n<p>CE fast(OA) persistent haunt (60-ft. radius centered around the vat)</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level </strong>11th</p>\n<p><strong>Notice </strong>Perception DC 20 (to smell the acrid chemical tang growing stronger)</p>\n<p><strong>hp </strong>54; <strong>Weakness </strong>vulnerable to acid damage (these effects damage the haunt); <strong>Trigger </strong>proximity; <strong>Reset </strong>1 day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The chemical vat boils and froths, and spits its contents at everyone within its range each round as a ranged touch attack (+15 to hit, 4d6+6 points of damage). This damage ignores damage reduction and energy resistance. A creature hit by the chemicals must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or become liquefied, as its bones and muscles melt into a pile of oozing flesh. The DC of this saving throw increases by 1 for each chemical ball that has hit the creature in the past 24 hours. A liquefied creature cannot carry, use, or wear any items, and its Dexterity score is reduced to 1. It loses all physical attacks, and it cannot cast spells with verbal or somatic components. It gains a slam attack appropriate for a creature of one size category larger than its size (for example, 1d6 points of damage if Medium). Additionally, it gains immunity to critical hits, flanking, paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep, and stun. A liquefied creature reverts to its normal state if the haunt is reduced to 0 hit points; otherwise, only a <em>limited wish</em>, <em>miracle</em>, <em>regenerate</em>, or <em>wish </em>spell can restore it.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction </strong>All of the alchemist's research notes must be collected and thrown into the vat.</p>\n<h1>Heart Explosion</h1>\n<p>The spirits responsible for this haunt were scared to death, and in their attempt to force mortals to understand their fear, they cause their victims' hearts to race faster and faster until they explode.</p>\n<h1>HEART EXPLOSION CR 13</h1>\n<p><strong>XP 25,600 </strong></p>\n<p>CE fast(OA) persistent haunt (60-ft. radius)</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level </strong>13th</p>\n<p><strong>Notice </strong>Heal or Perception DC 20 (for affected characters to feel pressure building around their hearts)</p>\n<p><strong>hp </strong>58; <strong>Trigger </strong>proximity; <strong>Reset </strong>1 day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The spectral form of a giant beating heart appears, and the hearts of everyone within the haunt's area begin to accelerate out of control. All creatures within the area are sickened, and must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save each round or be dazed and take 1d6+2 Constitution drain. If a creature who fails this saving throw has fewer than 10 hit points or reaches a Constitution score of 0, its heart forcefully explodes out of its chest, killing it instantly. The pressure of the explosion throws fragments of rib cage in all directions, dealing 2d6 points of slashing damage to all creatures within 10 feet (Reflex DC 21 negates). Creatures without hearts are immune to this haunt.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction </strong>The heart explosion haunt is destroyed if a good-aligned creature spends 3 days motionlessly meditating in the center of its area.</p>\n<h1>Crushing Terror</h1>\n<p>Tales of a legendary linnorm have drawn many daring adventurers who wish to prove themselves by slaying the dragon. The linnorm, for its part, appreciates the sport of hunting those who seek it, and is particularly fond of crushing its victims to death with its powerful tail. The spirits of these unfortunates linger on in the form of a crushing terror haunt.</p>\n<h1>CRUSHING TERROR CR 14</h1>\n<p><strong>XP 38,400 </strong></p>\n<p>NE persistent haunt (30-ft. radius)</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level </strong>13th</p>\n<p><strong>Notice </strong>Perception DC 20 (to hear the sound of bones snapping)</p>\n<p><strong>hp </strong>58; <strong>Trigger </strong>proximity; <strong>Reset </strong>1 hour</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>Several copies of the same colossal dragon's tail snake through the haunt's area. Each round, the tails attempt to grab and constrict each creature in the area (+18 to hit, 2d6+6 points of damage plus grab, CMB +35, constrict 2d6+18 points of damage). Each round a creature takes damage from the tail's constrict ability, one of its limbs (randomly determined) snaps into pieces, and it must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. Cure spells are not sufficient to repair the severely broken bones this haunt produces-only <em>heal </em>or stronger magic can mend them. Snapped limbs cannot be used for any purpose; having a snapped leg reduces a creature's movement speed by half when using its legs, and having more than half a creature's legs snapped prevents it from using any form of movement that uses its legs.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction </strong>The crushing terror haunt is destroyed if the bodies of the linnorm's victims are retrieved from the cave where it stores them, reassembled, and buried.</p>\n<h1>Final Soldier</h1>\n<p>The ancient antipaladin general responsible for this haunt ruled through fear, and forbade his soldiers from accepting surrender or showing mercy. His favorite way to end a battle was to order his soldiers to kill everyone but the opposing army's commander, then offer a rich reward to whichever of his soldiers could produce the opposing commander's head.</p>\n<h1>FINAL SOLDIER CR 15</h1>\n<p><strong>XP 51,200 </strong></p>\n<p>NE belligerent(OA) chained(OA) fast(OA) persistent tenacious* vaporous(OA) haunt (60-ft. radius)</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level </strong>15th</p>\n<p><strong>Notice </strong>Perception DC 20 (to hear the muted sounds of battle)</p>\n<p><strong>hp </strong>202; <strong>Trigger </strong>proximity; <strong>Reset </strong>1 day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>A horde of armor-clad spectral soldiers rises from all sides. On the haunt's initiative count, five soldiers beset each creature in the area, and each soldier makes a single incorporeal touch attack with a spectral sword (+12 to hit, 2d6+9 points of damage/19-20). Creatures in the haunt's area can attack the soldiers, but even if they destroy an individual soldier, five soldiers continue to attack each of the creatures each round until they disperse the haunt.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction </strong>The final soldier will rest only once the ancient general, who has risen as a graveknight (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 </em>138) antipaladin, is permanently destroyed.</p>\n<h1>Fallen from the Sky</h1>\n<p>A thriving metropolis on the top of a cliff customarily executed criminals by throwing them off the precipice, until the spirits of the condemned hurled the city's head magistrate over the edge as well.</p>\n<h1>FALLEN FROM THE SKY CR 16</h1>\n<p><strong>XP 76,800 </strong></p>\n<p>NE fast(OA) increased area(OA) persistent unyielding* haunt (160-ft.- radius area along the base and upper edge of a 200-ft.-tall cliff)</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level </strong>16th</p>\n<p><strong>Notice </strong>Perception DC 20 (to feel a slight tremor in the ground)</p>\n<p><strong>hp </strong>72; <strong>Trigger </strong>proximity; <strong>Reset </strong>1 day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The haunt causes all creatures within the haunt's area along the cliff's edge to plummet 200 feet to the ground, dealing 20d6 points of damage. The haunt temporarily negates spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities within its area as per <em>antimagic field</em>, except it does not block effects that deal positive energy damage. The haunt's entire area is always difficult terrain. Extraordinary abilities, such as a monk's slow fall ability, reduce falling damage as normal. The haunt lifts creatures back to the top of the cliff on each subsequent round, but it must then succeed at a combat maneuver check to bull rush each creature off the cliff (CMB +25). Creatures with natural flight can attempt a Fly check opposed by the haunt's CMB to control their descent and take no damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction </strong>The current head magistrate of the city must go to the cliff's edge and issue individual pardons by name to everyone who was ever thrown off the cliff, even those whose names were never recorded.</p>\n<h1>Haunted Dungeon</h1>\n<p>When enough haunts gather in a single dungeon, they can combine into a gestalt haunt that infuses the entire structure with a single, malevolent will. The haunt's source typically rests in the most difficult to find or obscure location within the structure, but it moves if it senses creatures approaching it.</p>\n<h1>HAUNTED DUNGEON CR 17</h1>\n<p><strong>XP 102,400 </strong></p>\n<p>CE belligerent(OA) elusive* free-roaming(OA) increased area(OA) persistent tenacious* haunt (entire structure, up to a 170-ft. radius)</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level </strong>17th</p>\n<p><strong>Notice </strong>Perception DC 10 (to notice all of the dungeon's furniture and trappings approaching)</p>\n<p><strong>hp </strong>229; <strong>Trigger </strong>proximity; <strong>Reset </strong>1 day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>This dungeon directs its malevolence toward everyone inside of it. Its interior is under the effects of <em>guards and wards </em>at all times. If this ability is dispelled, the haunt recreates it when it resets the following day. Once per minute, the dungeon can gather a collection of furniture and other items to form an animated object (<em>Bestiary </em>14). It can create one Colossal animated object; alternatively, it can create two Gargantuan animated objects, four Huge animated objects, and so on. It can control up to four times as many animated objects as it can create in a minute (for a total CR of 15). For the purposes of detecting creatures, the haunted dungeon and its animated objects have blindsight out to a range of the entire area of the haunt, even through walls.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction </strong>If the entire dungeon is simultaneously placed under the effects of <em>hallow</em>, the haunt is destroyed.</p>\n<h1>Flayed Suicide</h1>\n<p>A flayed suicide haunt arises from the spirits of people tortured beyond insanity, until no remnants of their former essence remain. Only kytons are capable of the depths of depravity required to produce this powerful, disturbing vestige of suffering.</p>\n<h1>FLAYED SUICIDE CR 18</h1>\n<p><strong>XP 153,600 </strong></p>\n<p>NE belligerent(OA) persistent unyielding* haunt (up to a 90-ft. radius)</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level </strong>20th</p>\n<p><strong>Notice </strong>Perception DC 20 (for affected characters to notice a prickling sensation in their skin)</p>\n<p><strong>hp </strong>243; <strong>Trigger </strong>proximity; <strong>Reset </strong>1 day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>Hundreds of razor-sharp knives appear and carve into the skin of those in the haunt's area. An affected creature can attempt a DC 25 Fortitude save to maintain the connection between its skin and its body. On a successful save, the creature takes 10d6 points of slashing damage. Creatures that fail this saving throw take 20d6 points of slashing damage as they are flayed alive. The skin of each flayed creature animates into a necromantic puppet that single-mindedly tries to kill its source. The skin carries all of the creature's equipment (and thus the creature loses access to this equipment), has access to all of its abilities, and shares its statistics, except its hit point total is equal to half the original creature's maximum hit points. If the skin uses one of the creature's limited-use abilities, it counts against the creature's total uses for the day. A flayed creature is permanently sickened, and is staggered from the pain unless it succeeds at a DC 25 Fortitude save at the beginning of its turn. Even if she defeats her necrotic skin, a flayed creature's skin never regrows naturally, and can only be restored with <em>regenerate</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction </strong>A flayed herald of a deity must be reunited with its skin and cured of its madness to give the haunt its final rest. If a character manages this feat, all flayed suicide haunts in existence on any plane are instantly destroyed.</p>\n<h1>Soul Vortex</h1>\n<p>The soul vortex is a gaping wound in the fabric of reality connected to the Negative Energy Plane. One may form at the site of a massive tragedy that claims hundreds of thousands of lives. The soul vortex annihilates the souls of anyone unfortunate enough to encounter it, and rips through the protections that even the most experienced adventurers consider unassailable.</p>\n<h1>SOUL VORTEX CR 19</h1>\n<p><strong>XP 204,800 </strong></p>\n<p>NE belligerent(OA) fast(OA) persistent unyielding* haunt (up to a 95-ft. radius)</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level </strong>20th</p>\n<p><strong>Notice </strong>Perception DC 20 (for affected creatures to notice a fundamental feeling that something is wrong within them)</p>\n<p><strong>hp </strong>256; <strong>Trigger </strong>proximity; <strong>Reset </strong>1 day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>A black vortex appears in the center of the haunt's radius, and tugs inexorably on the souls of all creatures within its reach. Each round, before it targets their souls, the vortex first targets the magic protecting them, affecting each creature with a <em>greater dispel magic </em>effect that targets <em>death ward </em>or any other spells that would prevent level drain first. After the dispelling effect, the creature must succeed at a DC 23 Will save to partially resist the vortex's pull. On a success, the creature takes 1d4 negative levels. On a failure, that creature's soul is wrenched out of its body and destroyed. Only <em>miracle </em>or <em>wish </em>can reconstitute a soul that the vortex devours. The vortex gains 5 temporary hit points for each level it drains- treat devouring a soul as draining as many negative levels as</p>\n<p>it would normally take to kill the creature. These temporary hit points stack and last for 1 hour. The soul vortex haunt is immune to the spells <em>heal </em>and <em>mass heal</em>. Creatures normally immune to fear lose that immunity within this haunt's radius.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction </strong>The soul vortex haunt can only be destroyed if the phylactery of a lich of CR 20 or higher that is currently destroyed and awaiting rejuvenation is cast into it. This act destroys both the vortex and the phylactery.</p>\n<h1>Twisted Wish</h1>\n<p>A twisted wish haunt can only arise in the most extraordinary circumstances, when a genie noble of considerable power dies with vengeance in its heart. It rests in places like wells or fountains where people go to make wishes, so it can use its powers frequently.</p>\n<h1>TWISTED WISH CR 20</h1>\n<p><strong>XP 307,200 </strong></p>\n<p>LE belligerent(OA) free-roaming(OA) unyielding* haunt (up to a 100-ft. radius)</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level </strong>20th</p>\n<p><strong>Notice </strong>Perception DC 35 (to notice a slight stutter in time originating from the center of its radius)</p>\n<p><strong>hp </strong>120; <strong>Trigger </strong>proximity; <strong>Reset </strong>1 day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The twisted wish haunt collects the wishes of those who come near it, and stores them until it decides to grant them at its leisure and in its own warped fashion. The haunt understands all languages, as per <em>tongues</em>, and does not need to manifest to hear every spoken wish and read every written wish within its radius. The haunt can manifest once per day to cast <em>wish </em>to grant any wish from its collection. It does not need to wait for a creature to enter its radius to manifest. The twisted wish is immune to the spells <em>heal </em>and <em>mass heal</em>. Unlike the effects of a typical haunt, the wishes this haunt grants do not count as fear effects. The haunt can fly at a speed of 10 feet even when it is not manifested, but it rarely chooses to do so unless its current region isn't providing enough victims, or it perceives someone as a potential threat.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction </strong>The sheer number of <em>wish </em>spells this haunt can bring to bear makes it nearly invincible. Only the direct intervention of a deity can destroy the twisted wish haunt.</p>\n<p>^Horror Rules Running Horror Adventures</p>"}

Chapter 6: Running Horror Adventures}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>An adventure might be a masterpiece of terror, but if it's being played on a sunny day with people laughing in the background, the players still might not be able to feel the mood. The surroundings can be a GM's greatest ally in telling a truly effective horror tale, but they might also work against her entirely. Consider the game space as a stage. This section includes ways that a GM might manipulate that performance space to create an atmosphere perfect for horror adventures.</p>\n<h1>Game Space</h1>\n<p>Since playing Pathfinder can take up a considerable area, the size of which is often limited by any number of practical constraints, game space can be one of the most difficult environmental factors to influence. If the GM has a choice, though, she can seek a quiet place where interruptions will be few-traffic and background noise can negatively impact the atmosphere being created. If she has to share a space, it might help for the GM to tell nonplayers that she's running a game and would appreciate not being interrupted, or she might schedule a time when disturbances will be limited. While a GM might consider running the game outside or in creepy surroundings like a crypt or cabin in the woods, keep in mind that such a venue could be distracting in itself and is probably more trouble than it's worth.</p>\n<h1>Lighting</h1>\n<p>Dimming the lights can go a long way in creating a moodier environment. Shadows add an air of the unknown, and cause everyday distractions to fade away. Make sure that the players can see, though-there's a lot of reading and page referencing in Pathfinder that GMs don't want to turn into a chore. A room with lights on a dimmer switch works well, as does turning off overhead lighting and moving a single-bulb lamp into the room. Candles and non-electric lamps typically prove distracting and troublesome, if not outright hazardous. While rooms with natural lighting can create issues during the day, at night, the dark can make them prime game spaces.</p>\n<h1>Music</h1>\n<p>Used well, music can be a powerful tool for creating atmosphere. Handled poorly, it can be a major distraction that irreparably warps, or even completely ruins, a game's mood. When a GM uses music in her horror game, the goal is to create a subtle but ever-present auditory undercurrent that reinforces her descriptions of settings and events. The music fills in gaps in the action with content that supports the story's atmosphere. Often breaks in play get filled in with distractions, but effective musical choices can counter that. Consider the following tips when selecting music to include in a horror adventure.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid the Familiar</strong>: Music should evoke a theme, but not a specific scene or character. Therefore, be wary of using immediately recognizable songs. Players who identify a particular theme will naturally associate a game with the source's events, often to distracting ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Keep It Simple</strong>: Don't let tinkering with audio devices or searching for the perfect song get in the way of a game. Assemble a playlist before the game. Select a theme for major NPCs and significant events, a few for prominent locations, one or two for battles, and one for a final battle. If a GM can run her music from a computer or phone, preferably linked to a wireless speaker, she can readily switch between tracks without leaving the game table.</p>\n<p><strong>Repetition</strong>: RPG scenes usually last longer than a typical music track. Rather than assembling dozens of pieces of music for every event or location in a game, find songs that work well in repetition. Video game scores work well for this as they're often designed with repeat listening in mind. Set a music player to repeat a track, changing it when the scene or story demands. Avoid songs that have an obvious element to them, like a particularly dramatic crescendo-so players don't notice the same section every time. In the best cases, players will notice the music for only a few moments at a time before their attention shifts back to the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Steady Mood, No Lyrics</strong>: A GM shouldn't have to compete with the music for the players' attention. When selecting music for a game, instrumental music that fades into the background is ideal. Avoid music with lyrics, as language distracts from what's being said and is noticed more readily when it repeats. By the same token, a GM wants songs that inspire a consistent mood. If a piece jumps from somber to upbeat, it won't serve when needed for one or the other.</p>\n<p><strong>Volume Manipulation</strong>: Most times, a GM wants background music to be low and subtle so players focus on the game. That said, manipulating volume allows her to create a number of special effects. Try using the music's volume to manipulate player attention. If the players' attention drifts, a GM can slowly turn up the volume until their focus shifts back to her. Once they've noticed she's waiting or has begun speaking, she can turn it back down. This is a fantastic way to end breaks and signal that play is restarting.</p>\n<p><strong>Volume Matching</strong>: In action-packed scenes, a GM can turn an energetic track up and raise her voice over it, quickening her speech's tempo to evoke a sense of urgency. If everyone has to speak louder to be heard over the music, it's easier to envision the hectic or dangerous nature of the accompanying scene. As with all narrative special effects, this technique works best when used infrequently.</p>\n<h1>House-Ruling Distractions</h1>\n<p>Portable games, social media, and other hobbies vie for everyone's attention. A GM, though, is the arbiter of the rules, both those in the game books and in her own house rules. Consider setting a simple house rule: When at the game table, the group is playing Pathfinder- and nothing else. Phones are away, computers are off, other hobbies and distractions-even RPG-related ones like painting miniatures-are set aside. The GM might expand this to most food and drink as well since eating and the presence of food containers undermine immersion.</p>\n<p>There are a number of reasons to adopt such rules. The first is simple engagement. Some players say they can do two things at once, but if they're not focused on the game, they're not imagining the story, thinking in character, or noticing the atmosphere. The second is a matter of verisimilitude. The characters likely don't have electronic devices. It's easier for everyone to envision their fellow players as their characters if they're not engaged in activities that run counter to what's possible in the game world. The final reason is just a matter of courtesy. A GM puts thought and time into an adventure, and the other players invest a similar degree of consideration in developing their characters. Just as an audience would in any other storytelling medium, players should repay such efforts with their respectful attention.</p>\n<p>If including rules for what is and isn't allowed at a game table, the GM should make them clear before the game starts, possibly explaining why or showing players this section of text as reasoning. The goal here is to create as atmospheric and immersive an experience as possible, not to be a tyrant.</p>\n<p>^Running Horror Adventures Horror Gear and Magic Items</p>"}

In a world of horror, there are alchemists, druids, and kineticists who steal the lives of others to increase their own power, as well as paladins who sacrifice themselves to protect their companions. Crazed clerics secretly worship eldritch abominations while brave but daring investigators track them and foolhardy wizards learn their maddening secrets in order to fight them. Dark spiritualists bond to horrible undead phantoms and righteous necromancers refuse to torture the dead and instead turn their powers to battling undead. Serial killers live a double life to avoid detection, and tireless profilers attempt to discover the truth before it's too late for the next in a grisly string of victims.</p>\n<p>When a character takes levels in a class, he must decide whether to take the standard class features or those presented by an archetype. Each archetype replaces specific class features from the parent class, and the choice to take an archetype does not need to be made until a character reaches the first level that includes a class feature that is altered or replaced.</p>\n<p>If an archetype includes multiple class features, a character must take all of them. He cannot decide to stop pursuing the archetype and instead take the replaced class features at later levels, unless doing so is specifically allowed by the archetype. All other class features of the base class that are not mentioned in the archetype remain unchanged and are acquired normally when the character reaches the appropriate level (unless noted otherwise). A character who takes an alternate class feature does not count as having the class feature that was replaced for the purposes of meeting any requirements or prerequisites.</p>\n<p>A character can take more than one archetype and gain additional alternate class features, but none of the archetypes can replace or alter the same class feature from the base class as another alternate class feature.</p>\n<p>If an archetype replaces a class feature that is part of a series of improvements or additions to a base ability (such as a fighter's weapon training or a rogue's uncanny dodge), the next time the character would gain that ability, it counts as the lower-level ability that was replaced by the archetype. In effect, all abilities in that series are delayed until the next time the class improves that ability. For example, if an archetype replaces a cleric's 2d6 channel energy at 3rd level, when she reaches 5th level and gains the next increase to her channel energy, it doesn't jump from 1d6 to 3d6-it instead improves to 2d6 just as if she finally gained the increase at 3rd level. This adjustment continues for every level at which her channel would improve until 19th level, when she finally reaches 9d6 instead of the 10d6 of a standard cleric.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.horror-adventures.Kmort2z27MN7wxMS]{2.01.

Chapter 1: Horror Characters}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>A foul curse has a deep hold on your body and soul. Your resentment toward the one who cursed you has taken on a life of its own. You notice slights against you by everyone around you, and can gain solace only by punishing them.</p>\n<h1>Catalyst</h1>\n<p>The corruption begins with a hateful curse, visitations from a night hag, or another relentless magical torment. These curses most often originate with hags, witches, gods, fey, depraved genies, or insidious divs. Even if the curse is lifted, its corruption lingers upon your soul.</p>\n<h1>Progression</h1>\n<p>The progression is tied to spiteful actions you take that have lasting consequences. When you inflict a permanent or long-lasting curse, such as <em>bestow curse</em>, or engage in brutal retaliation (what constitutes brutal retaliation is up to the GM, but usually includes disproportionate acts of violence against living creatures), you must attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 15 + your manifestation level). You must also attempt a saving throw after any month in which you have failed to perform a number of spiteful retaliations equal to or greater than your manifestation level. If you fail any of these saving throws, you must use the most severe punishment at your disposal against the next creature that wrongs you, even in a minor way.</p>\n<p>If you fail the save but your allies or others prevent you from exacting your retribution for three consecutive slights, you shake off this urge. You avoid having to exact retribution for the time being, and your corruption doesn't progress. However, the DC of the Will save against your corruption progressing increases by 2. These increases stack each time you shake off this urge, and they last until your corruption reaches the next corruption stage.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 1</strong>: The first time you engage in disproportionate punishment (voluntarily or because of a failed save), your alignment shifts one step toward evil and your face changes, making you memorably ugly or beautiful.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 2</strong>: The second time you engage in this behavior, your alignment shifts another step toward evil and you take on an inhuman appearance, increasingly resembling the type of creature that cursed you.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption Stage 3</strong>: The third time you engage in this behavior, you are utterly consumed by your hatred and become an NPC under the GM's control.</p>\n<h1>Removing the Corruption</h1>\n<p>Lifting the corruption requires breaking the original curse and either killing or earning forgiveness from the one who laid the curse. If you killed or permanently impaired any creatures unfairly, you must undo the harm and atone.</p>\n<h1>Manifestations</h1>\n<p>The following are manifestations of the accursed corruption.</p>\n<h1>Baleful Glare</h1>\n<p>You can weaken foes with a glare.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Manifestation level 6th.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Once per day, when you successfully use Intimidate to demoralize a creature within 30 feet, you can curse that target as a swift action. The victim must succeed at a Will save or be staggered permanently. If you use this ability on a creature that is still under the effects of your baleful glare from a previous day, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be paralyzed with fear for 3 days. At the end of each day the target spends paralyzed with fear, it must succeed at another Fortitude saving throw or die. Your effective caster level for these curses is equal to your character level.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: One eye becomes bulging and bloodshot or each eye turns a different color. You take a -4 penalty on Perception checks. This transformation can't be hidden by magic.</p>\n<h1>Cold Iron Allergy</h1>\n<p>Your skin is as hardened as your heart.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Manifestation level 4th.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain an amount of damage reduction equal to 1/2 your manifestation level. This DR is overcome by cold iron.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: Whenever you touch cold iron, including being struck by a cold iron weapon, you are sickened for 1 round. Immunities don't prevent this sickened condition, and you can't remove it early by any means. You can attempt to hide this aversion from foes with a Bluff check opposed by their Sense Motive checks.</p>\n<h1>Cruel Deceiver</h1>\n<p>You can weave magical lies to set victims up for a downfall.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Manifestation level 2nd.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: You gain a +2 bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks. You can use <em>dancing lights</em>, <em>disguise self</em>, and <em>ghost sound </em>once per day each as a spell-like ability. You can perfectly mimic the sound of any animal or voice you have ever heard. At manifestation level 3rd, the bonus doubles. At manifestation level 5th, you can use <em>mirage arcana </em>once per day as a spell-like ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You can never speak or otherwise communicate the truth. You can still communicate by various methods, such as uttering insignificant lies, obvious lies, or nonstatements.</p>\n<h1>Grim Fate</h1>\n<p>You can twist the strands of fate to your desires.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Once per day as an immediate action, you can reroll an ability check, attack roll, caster level check, saving throw, or skill check after learning the result. At manifestation level 8th, you can also lay a curse of unluck upon a creature (<em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook </em>557) once per day. This takes a standard action, and must target a creature you can see within 30 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You can't benefit from morale bonuses. You take a -2 penalty on Perform and Sense Motive checks. At manifestation level 3rd, the penalty doubles.</p>\n<h1>Horrific Shock</h1>\n<p>You can surprise a foe with overwhelming horror.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: When you damage a creature on the surprise round, it becomes shaken for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Will save.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You take on a horrible appearance. You take a -2 penalty on Diplomacy, Handle Animal, and wild empathy checks against creatures who can see you. At manifestation level 3rd, the penalty doubles.</p>\n<h1>Spiteful Transformation</h1>\n<p>You can transform foes into mere beasts.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Manifestation level 5th.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Add 1 to the DCs of your spells and abilities that have the curse descriptor (<em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic </em>137). Once per day as a standard action, you can use <em>baleful polymorph </em>as a spell-like ability, with a caster level equal to your character level. This counts as a curse, and the DC of any caster level check to remove it increases by 5.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You take a -2 penalty on Will saves. If you have this manifestation's gift, using your <em>baleful polymorph </em>curse negates the penalty until the next day.</p>\n<h1>Undying Hatred</h1>\n<p>You can't rest while those you hate go unpunished.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Once per day, if you would die from hit point damage, instead your hit point total becomes -1 and you stabilize. This ability doesn't work against death effects. Observers believe you to be dead unless they study you closely and succeed at a DC 25 Heal check. After 1 minute, you regain 1 hit point and regain consciousness.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: When you begin your turn with a helpless foe within 5 feet of your reach, you must attempt a Will save. If you fail, you must attempt a coup de grace against that foe this round if possible. The DC of this Will save is equal to 15 + your manifestation level.</p>\n<h1>Weakening Claws</h1>\n<p>Your fingernails grow into talons.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Manifestation level 3rd.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Your nails grow into claw natural weapons that deal 1d3 points of damage if you're Medium (1d2 if Small). Once per day, you can make a weakening claw attack as a standard action. If you hit, you inflict a permanent -4 penalty on the target's Strength score. The victim can halve the penalty and reduce the duration to 24 hours with a successful Fort save.</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: You take a -2 penalty on Disable Device checks, Sleight of Hand checks, and attacks with manufactured weapons. Your spells with somatic or emotion (<em>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures </em>144) components have a failure chance of 5%. If you have a spell failure chance from other sources, add the chances together.</p>\n<h1>Wish Peddler</h1>\n<p>Like a fey or genie, you can twist another creature's wishes.</p>\n<p><strong>Gift</strong>: Once per day as a full-round action, you can duplicate the effect of a witch spell of a spell level lower than your manifestation level. This spell cannot have a material or focus component costing more than 1 gp or a casting time longer than 1 standard action. The spell's effect must fulfill, in part or in whole, a wish verbally stated by a humanoid creature you can hear (other than yourself ).</p>\n<p><strong>Stain</strong>: If you cast or use a harmless spell or spell-like ability when you are in combat, you must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + double the spell level) or lose the spell. This also applies to nonharmless spells you cast that target only allies. Additionally, you must attempt saves against your allies' spells and spell-like abilities, even if they are harmless</p>"}

Chapter 5: Horror Rules","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<p>@Compendium[pf-content.horror-adventures.jsEW1pMN3Ds5FXmw]{(Index) Horror Adventures}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.horror-adventures.PFLYbkCimZRvhtit]{5.0. Chapter 5: Horror Rules}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The elements of a horror game might be gruesome, dreary, unnatural, or frightful, but they have the biggest impact if the players aren't quite expecting them. The rules in this chapter support some tried-and-true elements of horror that need new rules elements to be fully realized for a horror campaign. Though these rules are a good start for a GM running a horror campaign, it is equally important to set the right tone with how they're used. Each section delves into this topic some, but even more advice can be found in Chapter 6: #h;Running Horror Adventures.</p>\n<p>The horror rules topics sections of this book are as follows.</p>\n<h1>CURSES (PAGE 138)</h1>\n<p>Inflicting dreadful consequences and sapping away one's abilities or sense of self, curses are a reminder-often a permanent one-of the horrors a character has seen or the incautious mistakes he has made. The curses and cursed items in the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook </em>cover the basic circumstances for bringing curses into a game through a battle or in a treasure hoard. However, a horror game needs curses that work on a wider scale and involve and influence the actions of the players to inspire entire sessions or adventures.</p>\n<p>The Curses section includes a breakdown of how curse spells work. This is followed by several new curses-many of which are more involved than the curses found in the <em>Core Rulebook </em>and geared toward creating a narrative within the game rather than applying penalties or dealing ability damage. This section also gives advice on creating new curses for a game and ways to make them interesting. Types of curses, novel ways to break curses, and possible conditions for ending curses are all covered here. Cursed items come next, with rules on deliberately crafting cursed items, as well as examples of purposefully cursed items.</p>\n<p>Though most commonly thought of as afflicting people and other creatures, curses can plague an entire region. The cursed land rules present curses on this scale, allowing GMs to represent places where the soil is blighted, a building takes on something like sentience, or the entire land falls under eternal night. The Cursed Land section describes how an area can become tied to one malevolent or accursed creature, and make use of the environment rules in this chapter and the dread lord template on page 234. Finally, curse templates provide a quick way to make curses contagious, especially deadly, or handed down through generations.</p>\n<h1>HORRIFIC DISEASES (PAGE 146)</h1>\n<p>Slowly devastating the body or mind, a disease can be a physical reminder of evil's blight. This section includes templates to empower existing diseases, increasing their virulence, magic resistance, lethality, and so on.</p>\n<p>In addition, this section features new diseases that work differently from the diseases in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>. Rather than having a set effect that repeats, they get worse over time, going through increasingly severe stages: carrier, early, moderate, severe, and terminal. These new diseases include gruesome ailments like brain moss, gore worms, and skin wastes.</p>\n<h1>ENVIRONMENTS (PAGE 152)</h1>\n<p>Fog-shrouded moors, dreary forests of gnarled gray trees where red eyes glow in the shadows, or the steaming ground of haunted graveyards-evocative environments make horror games more immersive and create a sense of dread. The environments section describes some unique features of horrific locations, like imgage;facelesss, godless voids, and twisted mansion hallways that mislead visitors and reshape themselves.</p>\n<p>This section also features new hazards, which are presented for various CRs. They range from simple bat colonies and eerie echoes to rains of gore and grasping graves. The Domains of Evil section gives GMs the tools to create a horror realm ruled over by a dreadful dread lord (see page 159). The land warps to match the lord's tortured soul, and hazards crop up throughout the land.</p>\n<p>Horrific traps are more involved and deadly than the basic traps found in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>, and are perfect for estates and castles where monsters dwell. Finally, the Nightmare Dreamscapes section describes how both mundane and supernatural nightmares work.</p>\n<h1>FLESHWARPING (PAGE 164)</h1>\n<p>By transforming creatures into unnatural new forms, fleshwarpers create bizarre monsters unlike anything else already living. The most comprehensive form of fleshwarping, true fleshwarping creates new types of creatures by painstakingly altering unfortunate specimens' entire biology. This process originally created driders, fleshdregs, sinspawn, and other abominations.</p>\n<p>By contrast, fleshcrafting reshapes only a small portion of a creature's form, sometimes only temporarily. A fleshcraft graft gives the creature abilities unlike other creatures of its type, such as a set of gills, fangs, or a carapace.</p>\n<p>The third category of fleshwarping is called fleshwarp mutations, and covers mutations that comes about from environmental effects like radiation, pollution, or magic. Tables in this section allow GMs to randomly generate mutations at various levels of severity.</p>\n<h1>Other Horror Rules</h1>\n<p><em>Horror Adventures </em>teems with systems, tools, and guidance for running horror-themed games, but it's not the first Pathfinder RPG book to touch on that territory. The rules and systems from numerous other sources fit well in horror-themed campaigns. The list below points toward relevant sections of these sources, and mentions which ones link with systems within this book when applicable. For a similar listing of horror monsters, see page 232.</p>\n<h1>Core Rulebook</h1>\n<p>Cursed Items (page 538)</p>\n<p>Curses and Diseases (pages 556 and 557; related to Curses and Horrific Diseases from this chapter)</p>\n<h1>GameMastery Guide</h1>\n<p>Planar (page 184; describes many planes suitable for extraplanar horror games)</p>\n<p>Haunts (page 242)</p>\n<p>Sanity and Madness (page 250)</p>\n<h1>Occult Adventures</h1>\n<p>Possession (page 206)</p>\n<p>Occult Rituals (page 208; more occult rituals appear in Chapter 4 of this book)</p>\n<p>New Haunt Rules and New Haunts (page 228)</p>\n<p>Mindscapes (page 234; related to Nightmare Dreamscapes in this chapter)</p>\n<p>Esoteric Planes (page 238; notably includes the Dimension of Dreams)</p>\n<p>Cursed Items (page 265)</p>\n<h1>Ultimate Campaign</h1>\n<p>Alignment (page 134)</p>\n<h1>Ultimate Equipment</h1>\n<p>Cursed Items (page 342)</p>\n<h1>Ultimate Magic</h1>\n<p>Binding Outsiders (page 101)</p>\n<h1>HAUNTS (PAGE 172)</h1>\n<p>One of the most ubiquitous representations of horror in the Pathfinder RPG, haunts provide a different kind of challenge from monsters. To make haunts more versatile, this section includes haunt elements, which function like templates to change the effects of haunts.</p>\n<p>After that come variant haunts. Though haunts normally work like undead, other forms of horror can manifest as haunts. The influence of the Great Old Ones, magical scars, dimensional instabilities, and psychic energy can all give rise to these variants.</p>\n<p>The lengthiest part of this section provides a massive number of new haunts stretching from CR 1/4 to CR 20. Scratching behind the walls, specters of betrayal, an entire haunted dungeon, and a collector of twisted wishes all appear within this selection.</p>\n<h1>MADNESS (PAGE 182)</h1>\n<p>Witnessing supernatural horror or undergoing great trauma can cause madness. These forms of insanity can be used with the sanity system from Chapter 1 (see page 12), but since they're presented as afflictions, they can be used even without that system. The section includes guidance on how to use these madnesses in coordination with the insanity rules from <em>Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide</em>.</p>\n<p>Madnesses come in two categories, one more severe than the other. Lesser madnesses include difficult but not entirely debilitating effects, such as delusion, melancholia, and paranoia. Greater madnesses have a much stronger impact, and include amnesia and catatonia.</p>\n<p>^Horror Rules Running Horror Adventures</p>"}

Chapter 6: Running Horror Adventures}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Horror stories are not all alike, and neither are all horror adventures. In fiction and film, horror is divided into numerous subgenres. This section introduces just a few of those subgenres to help the GM choose the type of horror story she wants to tell and create adventures that match. While nowhere near a complete listing, the following horror subgenres have been singled out either because they translate easily into Pathfinder RPG adventures or they are particularly challenging to translate and often need more advice than usual to succeed.</p>\n<p>Each of the following subgenres follows a similar format: a general description, followed by four sections.</p>\n<p><strong>Storytelling</strong>: This section features notes on themes common to stories in this subgenre and elements to consider including in a subgenre-based Pathfinder adventure.</p>\n<p><strong>Monsters and Threats</strong>: This section includes a selection of creatures and rules content that make appropriate threats for this subgenre. Monsters in products other than the&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary&nbsp;</em>include a superscript reference.</p>\n<p><strong>Basic Plots</strong>: This section contains examples of plots with central subgenre elements that make fine one-off adventures. A GM can flesh out these ideas or use them as departure points to create her own adventures.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Plots</strong>: Advanced plots are more complex, and can serve as the basis for entire campaigns. Again, they can be used to inspire unique adventures.</p>\n<h1>Body Horror</h1>\n<p>The body is a frail, little-understood thing that might betray its host-consciousness at any moment. This visceral subgenre concerns itself with the organic terror of the flesh, including disease, physical corruption, and transformation. At its basest level, body horror is the revulsion felt upon hearing a bone break or seeing a joint violently bend in the wrong direction. Elaborated upon, it's the terror of becoming physically monstrous and the awfulness that might hide within.</p>\n<p><strong>Storytelling</strong>: Body horror plots often concern themselves with transformation. This might be in a mundane fashion, such as a character racing to find a cure for a withering disease, trying to escape enemy territory with a broken leg, or knowing that a parasite is devouring his flesh. Unleashed from reality, body horror might involve an uncontrolled transformation, a disease that has gained sentience, or a monster that consumes flesh or blood. Body horror plots can involve a timeline or countdown, evoking a disease running its course or an untreated wound turning gangrenous. The only way to stop the spread of whatever fleshy terror has been unleashed is to cure it medically or excise it with sword or spell before it is too late. Doing so often comes with the greatest threat of body horror: infection. Characters might suffer curses (see page 138), contract terrible illnesses (see page 146), undergo horrific corruptions (see page 14), or become host to ravenous parasites. Customize body horror effects to the story's needs, pairing nauseating descriptions with game-affecting effects like loss of limbs, hit point damage, ability score drain, inability to naturally heal, or worse.</p>\n<p>GMs running body horror adventures will likely find that many players have powerful reactions to descriptions of gore and disease symptoms. A GM should describe such scenes in a way that's right for her players, and remember that gratuitous descriptions quickly lose their impact. Uncertainty and time are also powerful factors in body horror stories, with PCs often unsure whether they or those they love are safe from infection-and if they don't show signs today, what about tomorrow?</p>\n<p>The enemy in a body horror game can also be unclear. While it might be individuals spreading a plague, a race of sentient parasites, or a mad scientist transforming victims, it might also be simply a disease itself. The former examples lend themselves toward common Pathfinder plots. The latter, though, might unfold as a scavenger hunt or series of challenges that contribute toward concocting a cure. In such cases, the final challenge should be the most harrowing and present the greatest risk of exposure to infection. In that way, the defeat of the invisible menace has a climax, but it also has the extremely personal threat of another outbreak.</p>\n<p><strong>Monsters and Threats</strong>: Parasites and diseases often feature in body horror stories, so consider rot grubs(B3) (of the giant variety or more common hazards), ear seekers (<em>Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide&nbsp;</em>244), intellect devourers, or visceral plagues from the disease list on page 557 of the&nbsp;<em>Core Rulebook&nbsp;</em>(though consider using the rules for diseases on page 138 of&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained</em>) or the disease section of this book (see page 146). Creatures that implant their eggs or are born from other creatures include lunarmas(B4), vegepygmies, and xills, while those who cling to or take over a host's body include incutilises(B4) and wizard's shackles(B5). Fleshwarps(B4) and oozes like carnivorous blobs(B2) embody the horror of abominable transformation, beheaded(B4) and crawling hands(B2) are unbound body parts, and drow and kytons use flesh as mediums for their art or taboo experimentations. Many of the corruptions on pages 14-37 and the fleshwarping rules on pages 164-171 of this book also allow a PC to experience the terror of transformation firsthand.</p>\n<p><strong>Basic Plots</strong>: A quarantine traps the PCs in a city suffering from bubonic plague. A breed of oozes infests a community's sewers, changing those they touch into melting zombies. Ghorazaghs(B3) capture the PCs in a labyrinthine scab-hive.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Plots</strong>: The secret of an incestuous imperial dynasty reveals an undercity of vain, inbred mongrelmen(B2) lurking beneath the capital. A mind-altering disease (to which elves are mysteriously immune) becomes sentient, infects the minds of hundreds, and launches a pogrom against those it can't infect. A nation's pervasive, cowlike herd animals stave off famine, but the nation turns on the PCs when they expose that the creatures are semi-sentient drakainia(B4) spawn.</p>\n<h1>Cosmic Horror</h1>\n<p>Often called cosmicism or Lovecraftian horror, stories in this subgenre involve the realization that humanity and all its struggles are insignificant amid the greater workings of the universe. Such plots typically involve revelations of the truth that shelters the limited, shared lie society calls reality. The forces beyond this veil are fundamentally unfathomable, indifferent, and dangerous. Brushes with these powers typically scar a character, resulting in death, insanity, or understandings that make her an outcast from society. Ignorance and willful delusion then become virtues, shields that protect a fragile narrative from the truth of a vast, apathetic cosmos.</p>\n<p><strong>Storytelling</strong>: Cosmic horror stories aren't about tentacles- they're about the truths mortals are better off not knowing. Perhaps these revelations are the secrets of cosmic overlords, or maybe they're leaps of understanding-realities radically different from what society thinks it knows. The pursuit of greater knowledge can begin as a noble quest, gradually revealing an organic conspiracy propagating truths too great for the characters to influence. A GM might provide bread crumbs leading toward this knowledge, but the PCs' limited perspective grants only glimpses of the terrible whole. The discovery of strange cults or unsettling artifacts might push characters to uncover devices and creatures not native to their understanding of the world. These elements are best revealed slowly, like evidence in a mystery story, and they should build upon one another to suggest ever-greater threats. Ultimately, the threat might be entities from beyond gulfs of existence, or even be something like the arrangement of the stars themselves-foes that can't be defeated with sword and spell. While the PCs might win a skirmish with such forces and prevent the apocalypse du jour, their world's days are numbered. Depending on how much the PCs learn, they might never again be able to share in the vision of reality needed to function in society. If that wasn't terrible enough, when they glimpse the truths beyond the veil, those sanity-bending forces gaze back.</p>\n<p><strong>Monsters and Threats</strong>: Cosmic horror games frequently feature aliens-intruders from other worlds, planes, or epochs. These are not typically spiritual beings, like angels or demons, but neighbors in existence that prove the laws of reality aren't exactly fair. Many creatures from the works of H. P. Lovecraft and other authors of this subgenre exist in the Pathfinder RPG and fit naturally into cosmic horror adventures, such as deep ones(B5), denizens of Leng(B2), elder things(B4), Great Old Ones (B4), mi-go(B4), shoggoths, and Yithians(B3), to name just a few. Lovecraftian creatures don't have exclusive dominion over this subgenre, though. Given the right backstory, any creature with an aberrant form or mind makes a useful cosmic horror foe, like aboleths, chokers, cloakers, hunduns(B5), hyakumes(B4), immortal ichors(B4), and otyughs. Consider casting whole races or creature types as manipulators from other worlds or beings possessed of enigmatic agendas, such as aberrations, certain monstrous humanoids, or fey.</p>\n<p>Beyond bizarre monsters, tools and artifacts from other worlds might prove to be equally dangerous. Consider taking a familiar item and describing it in an otherworldly fashion-a crossbow takes on an entirely different aspect if it screams every time it's fired. Magic, too, if learned from otherworldly sources, might gain a dangerous cast, perhaps dealing damage to the caster or eroding a character's ability scores. Shocking discoveries can also present their own dangers in the form of sanity effects. See page 182 for a host of reactions characters might experience when their visions of reality shake and their pillars of sanity crumble.</p>\n<p><strong>Basic Plots</strong>: An ally, fearing for his life, provides the PCs with a secret or relic pursued by servants of a god-ocean that covers a distant moon. Opening an ancient vault unleashes a member of a race for which time means nothing. A town forsakes its religions after a seasonally appearing comet lands atop a windmill outside their community.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Plots</strong>: A strange nightmare, swift-growing plant, or spreading wound holds a means of communicating with a future dominated by another species. In the wake of a planetary alignment, an entire race begins fleeing the planet. A musician discovers tones that allow her to reshape reality, drawing the attention of otherworldly star-shrieks.</p>\n<h1>Dark Fantasy</h1>\n<p>As its name implies, dark fantasy isn't a subgenre of horror but rather a fantasy subgenre that relies on horror themes. Dark fantasies typically involve the same tropes as fantasy tales-swords, castles, magic, heroics-but viewed through a grim lens. Deadliness, despair, and the macabre are common here, elements that threaten innocents with forces beyond their power to understand or overcome.</p>\n<p><strong>Storytelling</strong>: In these tales, magic and the supernatural take on a darker and deadlier cast. Enchanted lands become accursed places filled with ravenous predators and dangerous outcasts. Magic might bear the threat of arcane backlash or addiction. Monsters are fearful things, whether they are born from the corpses of former neighbors, demonic incarnations of temptations, or terrifying beasts that city walls dubiously hold at bay. It's a pessimistic sort of fantasy where threats are many and death seems likely, yet the heroes of these stories have the opportunity to defend the rare places of warmth and light. Not unlike other fantasy heroes, they become champions of the helpless and foes of evil. However, here the odds are stacked far more heavily against them.</p>\n<p><strong>Monsters and Threats</strong>: Aberrations, constructs, evil outsiders, and undead are common in dark fantasy adventures, as are grim reimaginings of magical beasts and other classic fantasy creatures. Evil spells, cursed magic items, and magical environmental hazards are also typical. With a properly grim twist, nearly any fantasy element could find its home in a dark fantasy adventure.</p>\n<p><strong>Basic Plots</strong>: Necromancers use the corpses of a plague-scoured village to create a gashadokuro(B4). A gargoyle trophy hunter is responsible for a series of baffling murders. A troll uses the sewer to slip into the basement of the royal archives and preys upon scholars who linger too long after dark.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Plots</strong>: A genius arcanist seeks to recreate the empire of a fallen undead tyrant by retracing his path to lichdom. A rift between realities allows the hordes of the Abyss to invade the world. The corpse of everyone who dies returns as a ghoul within 1 day, forcing the PCs to investigate why souls are not passing on to the afterlife.</p>\n<h1>Ghost Story</h1>\n<p>These stories feature ghosts-whether they're actual spirits or the characters simply believe in those spirits. Usually relatively short tales, stories in this subgenre focus on wayward souls and the tragic events that keep them from passing on. They usually feature a haunted place-such as the archetypical haunted house-but this might be any location, object, person, or other element that is somehow tied to the spirit's unfortunate past. The protagonists of a ghost story tend to be latecomers to the tragedy. By entering the zone of spiritual fallout, they either embroil themselves in healing residual scars or try to escape before becoming the next victims.</p>\n<p><strong>Storytelling</strong>: Ghost stories make fantastic single-adventure plots because they typically link an atmospheric story with a specific location. The tie between a ghost and its haunting grounds means that PCs can indulge in a ghost story without it necessarily interfering with a wider campaign.</p>\n<p>Ghosts come in an enormous variety, but for horror adventures, the two most useful are ghosts that want something and violent ghosts. The former might be sorrowful entities that make the PCs their agents in the hopes of being set free. The latter are vicious things, incarnations of madness and violence that take their wrath out on any who dare trespass on their haunting grounds. In neither case does a ghost need to be a sympathetic character, but in both, the spirit's origins affect its appearance, abilities, and behavior. While revealing the lore behind a haunting might be story enough, in a typical Pathfinder ghost story, learning the spirit's background and using it to put the ghost to rest is central to the plot.</p>\n<p>With the wealth of ghost stories in fiction and film, a GM can plunder existing works for inspiration and experiment with the definitions of \"ghost\" and \"haunting.\" She might also consider giving the ghost story a trigger, an event that activates a dormant haunting. Perhaps the return of a family member to his ancestral home or a PC gazing through an orb that reveals the spirit world sparks a full-blown ghost story.</p>\n<p><strong>Monsters and Threats</strong>: Obviously, these tales focus on ghosts, but in the Pathfinder RPG, \"ghost\" might mean a variety of things, not just the monster of the same name. However, a ghost is an excellent choice of monster due to its rejuvenation ability, which means the spirit can only be truly defeated if the PCs discover the correct means. This ability forces the PCs to involve themselves in a ghost story to defeat their foe.</p>\n<p>A GM might use any number of ghostly spirits to create specific sorts of ghost stories-for instance, banshees(B2) terrorize barren moors, poltergeists(B2) disturb peaceful households, and yuki-onnas(B3) haunt snowy vistas. Looking up creatures with the incorporeal subtype in Appendix 8 of any&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary&nbsp;</em>volume can point to strong ghost story candidates. Ghosts don't need to be incorporeal. Phantom armors(B4), revenants(B2), skeletal champions, and zuvembies(B3), for example, all make fine corporeal threats. A \"ghost\" also doesn't need to be undead, especially as the line between spirit and outsider is often blurry. Consider having any of a variety of fiends-such as owbs(B4) or vulnudaemonsB3-haunt a ghost story. For story purposes, a GM shouldn't hesitate to give non-ghosts the rejuvenation ability as well, but only so long as the threat stays bound to a single plot-rich locale.</p>\n<p>More so than in other subgenres, haunts make obvious choices (see page 172 for haunt ideas). Spectral beings (especially geistsB4) teamed with a variety of flavorful haunts can work together to create a wider and more satisfying haunting.</p>\n<p><strong>Basic Plots</strong>: The destruction of a local asylum releases years of pent-up mental trauma as an allip(B3) or caller in darkness(B5), the dominant personality of which wants nothing more than to visit the sea once more. The ghost of a golem-crafter intimidates a young trespasser into reactivating her laboratory and creating a soulbound(B4) body for her to inhabit. A painting from a far-off land drags the ghost of the portrait's subject with it, a noble but frustrated foreign warrior who speaks only his native language.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Plots</strong>: A ghost becomes the PCs' patron, offering its treasure (or home) if they complete what it left undone. A violent, mute ghost the PCs thought exorcised reappears- could they have mistaken its identity? The ghost of a defeated villain or a fallen ally becomes linked to one of the PCs' pieces of equipment, though the connection seems to be stronger than simply that between victim and murder weapon.</p>\n<h1>Gothic Horror</h1>\n<p>Gothic horrors exude atmosphere and portent. This is the subgenre of&nbsp;<em>The Castle of Otranto</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Raven</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dracula</em>. Lightning-illuminated castles, baroque cathedrals, tortured minds, and unquiet souls fill these stories, every element fostering moodiness and presaging dooms-often through ornate description. While gothic horror regularly focuses on darkness, decay, fallen grandeur, and the wages of sin, it can also be rich with romance and bravery, making it well suited to Pathfinder adventures.</p>\n<p><strong>Storytelling</strong>: More than any specific monster or type of fear, in the best of these stories, grim details work together to create an oppressive atmosphere of perpetual fall or winter, where secret transgressions exert dark prices in the form decrepitude, sickness, curses, and monstrous predation. Settings, characters, and plot all work together in gothic tales, and a GM should strive to insinuate that dark things are to come through elements of the narrative. If any subgenre is going to feature sudden thunderstorms, ominous coincidences, or peasant warnings, it's gothic horror. The evil force at the end of this foreboding path might have the statistics of a brooding vampire or an ageless wizard, but by the time the PCs meet her, what they've experienced should have built her up as something much more.</p>\n<p>Gothic horror tales highlight and develop wealth, extravagance, and the noble or positive qualities of characters to better wring pathos from their ruination. Romances are also common, whether as the spark that ignites dark passions or as the motivation for heroics. Death, desperation, and madness are frequent results of both themes, paving the way for encounters with the fantastic, deals with wicked forces, and passions that keep characters from a peaceful death. Indulging these themes suggests not only a host of settings (like crumbling manors, grim cathedrals, and misty graveyards), but also stock characters (suspicious townsfolk, penniless nobles, and ghostly governesses) waiting to populate a gothic tale.</p>\n<p><strong>Monsters and Threats</strong>: The mainstays of gothic horror include some of the most identifiable monsters in fiction and folklore: fiends, ghosts, hags, lycanthropes, mummies, murderous animals, skeletons, vampires, yeth hounds, and the like. Almost any monster could make a fine villain in a gothic horror story, though, so long as it has a tragic background and intentions of menace. For example, the sorrow of a lovelorn dryad might extend beyond herself, transforming a wilderness into a savage nightmare.</p>\n<p>Insidious magic items-like&nbsp;<em>monkeys' paws&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>soul portraits</em>-also often appear in gothic stories, the objects taking on the sins of their past owners. Bargains with fiends, foul gods, or perhaps even death itself can inspire tragic villains. Haunts also make useful threats for gothic horror tales, their descriptive dangers providing a way to reveal mournful histories-perhaps piece by piece through a series of interrelated, tragic events.</p>\n<p><strong>Basic Plots</strong>: Every hundred years, a graveknight(B3) appears and challenges the high priest of the goddess of valor, whose cathedral stands upon an ancient battlefield. A changeling(B4) begs for the PCs' protection, fearful of the crone she's seen in her nightmares. The PCs must retrieve a lost locket from a spectral house that appears only on the night of the winter solstice.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Plots</strong>: A PC is the reincarnated lover of an ancient vampire baroness. A mothman(B2) follows the PCs from afar, intent on creating, ending, or repeating an age-long curse. The entire faith of a just deity is convinced a PC holds the key to a horrible prophecy and can't be allowed to live.</p>\n<h1>Psychological Horror</h1>\n<p>As a counterpoint to body horror, the psychological horror subgenre plays upon the fears and uncertainties rooted deep within the mind. The possibility of becoming detached from reality, plots to drive people mad, and the menace of taboo urges all fill the surreal world of psychological horror. While these stories might involve supernatural elements, it's often difficult for characters to be sure whether such menaces are real or entirely within their heads.</p>\n<p><strong>Storytelling</strong>: Among the most challenging subgenres of horror to re-create in a Pathfinder adventure, psychological horror stories often deal with themes of conspiracy, doubt, and paranoia. In film and fiction, these stories might focus on a single individual being pushed beyond her limit as the lines of reality blur around her. In a Pathfinder adventure, it's difficult to make one PC the victim of such horror-but it is possible. While the rules for sanity simulate a variety of psychological effects, these are most effective when a player chooses to roleplay their effects, forcing the group to acknowledge that the character's grip on reality has slipped. Beyond those rules, the techniques described in the Warp Reality section on page 199 and in the Secrets and Suspicion section on page 201 can help sow uncertainty among the players, leaving them wondering what's real and who they can trust.</p>\n<p>Easier to create are adventures where another individual has lost his grip on reality, leading him to commit monstrous acts and possibly transform his home into a manifestation of his delusions. Conspiracy plots might unite a cadre of foes seeking to hide some shocking truth, perhaps making the PCs question whether lifelong beliefs have been lies all along. In more extreme cases, the PCs might become victims of gaslighting (perhaps by a gaslighter mesmerist; see page 60), either in subtle ways or in elaborate experiments-like a dungeon of shifting passages or a deadly puzzle room- meant to drive them insane.</p>\n<p><strong>Monsters and Threats</strong>: Cunning shapechangers (like araneas, doppelgangers, and rakshasas) and creatures with manipulative mind powers (like aboleths, grays(B5), and lotus treesB5) make fantastic foes in psychological horror adventures. Psychic magic is an obvious threat in these tales, warping memories and outright controlling the weak willed, but so are illusions, which can manipulate what a victim perceives or thinks he knows. More insidious than monsters in psychological horror stories are the everyday people who manufacture plots to undermine someone's sanity or the individuals whose stresses and delusions become uncontrollable enough to set them on deadly courses-like a deranged individual who makes his home a trap-filled murder pit or a zealot who believes his sins can only be purified with innocent blood.</p>\n<p><strong>Basic Plots</strong>: A divine emissary in animal form comes to a PC and encourages her to slay a secret enemy of the faith- but it only speaks when the PC is alone. The PCs need to cure a scholar who has gone insane by entering his hag-haunted nightmares. The PCs come to a town where a teenage girl can turn herself invisible, and everyone lives in fear of what she does, doesn't, or could know.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Plots</strong>: The PCs become aware they are the only true humanoids in a society that consists entirely of doppelgangers. Derros kidnap the inhabitants of an entire village without their knowledge, relocating them to a near-perfect re-creation of their community deep underground. A pakalchi sahkil(B5) convinces the queen that her court mages have turned against her, leading her to start a bloody witch hunt throughout the entire nation.</p>\n<h1>Slasher Horror</h1>\n<p>Violent stories that pit relentless murderers against defenseless victims, slasher horror is the home of some of film's most brutal killers. These tales typically follow the rampage of a single weapon-wielding psychopath and his targets' desperate attempts to survive. The slasher is usually more than a normal person, possessing a drive or fortitude that makes him more akin to a deadly force of nature. Only bravery and cunning hold any hope of defeating the slasher, and even then, usually only after he has spilled seas of blood.</p>\n<p><strong>Storytelling</strong>: Of primary importance to a slasher story is the sense of inescapability. If the would-be victims can just leave an area and escape the slasher, his threat is undermined. Therefore, seclusion is important. Perhaps the PCs-the likely victims-are isolated by geography (on an island, in the mountains), by terrible weather, or by some other physical factor (a flood washed out the road, the PCs are in a labyrinth that's supposedly inescapable). Social factors can also create seclusion. Perhaps the PCs don't speak the language and can't effectively go for help, know the town guard wants to shield the murderer, have a responsibility to stay in a place, or are cursed and can't leave an area. In any case, the PCs are trapped with a menace they're not likely able to physically overcome.</p>\n<p>As monsters and combat are such fundamental parts of the Pathfinder RPG, it's easy for a slasher attack to become just another fight. Elusiveness, relentlessness, and the perception of invincibility are the slasher's greatest weapons. To avoid this, the slasher can't just be an opponent the PCs outmatch, making them have to find ways other than combat to defeat their foe. A GM should make the slasher difficult to fight, but not impossible to defeat. The PCs need to be able to find tools and prepare traps that give them an edge over their foe. Objects meaningful to the slasher (and perhaps his origins) might aid them in their fight. The plot might encourage characters to split up to defeat the slasher and thus make them vulnerable to their foe-see Splitting the Party on page 203 for ways to help build tension in situations like this.</p>\n<p>Signature weapons are powerful elements in slasher stories. A GM might give the slasher a weapon that's threatening but also metaphorical-like a headsman's axe or a scythe. Tools and unique creations that tie into the slasher's history and origins also make great murder weapons-like a harpoon, a daggerlike quilting needle, or a shark jaw fitted onto an iron mask.</p>\n<p><strong>Monsters and Threats</strong>: Slasher tales are monster stories. What constitutes the monster, though, is entirely up to the GM. The implacable stalker template (see page 238) specifically allows for slashers to be made out of any sort of creature or character.</p>\n<p>Often slashers are murderous humanoids who have been driven violently insane or who have become possessed by brutal objectives. These sort of slashers emphasize the monstrousness of everyday people, which might be a concept a GM wants indulge.</p>\n<p>Actual monsters can also make fine slashers. Creatures that bear a semblance to everyday people but obviously aren't work well for this, like apes, bugbears, goblins, ogrekin(B2), redcaps(B2), and trolls. Finally, more monstrous creatures easily become slashers, even though the PCs might have a limited ability to see something of themselves in such foes. Rather than creatures with obviously monstrous forms, certain beings might pass as humanoids with the right disguises or magic, like babau demons, bogeymen(B3), dark stalkers, denizens of Leng(B2), or dullahans(B2). Or perhaps the slasher's form is inconsequential, and the true murderous entity is the sentient weapon he bears.</p>\n<p><strong>Basic Plots</strong>: The daughter of a villain the PCs slew years ago catches up to them at a lonely country inn and proceeds to poison everyone in the establishment, one at a time. The PCs' journey forces them to pass through the Valley of the Skulleater, home to a strangely intelligent and elusive bear that relentlessly stalks trespassers. A marsh giant shaman begins murdering everyone associated with the village that killed his son.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Plots</strong>: The PCs find a crimson garrote that belonged to a famous killer, leading to a rash of murders following in their wake. Mere months after raiding a crypt, a mummy lord(B5) appears and attempts to slay the PCs, reappearing yearly on the anniversary of the defiling. Because of her remarkable lineage, the notorious serial killer known only as the Queen of Razors can't be killed without infuriating the royal church, but the PCs can't allow her to kill again.</p>"}

Chapter 7: Horror Gear And Magic Items}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This chapter details new gear ranging from implements of torture to alchemical mixtures and magic items to add a taste of horror to your game. The final two pages discuss the horrifying possibility of trusted items becoming possessed.</p>\n<h1>TORTURE IMPLEMENTS</h1>\n<p>These devices cause great pain, and are often used in torture. Engaging in torture is ultimately nothing more a sadistic means to control another person. Rather than being an effective means of interrogation, torture produces notoriously inaccurate information designed to tell the torturer what she wants to hear and make the torture stop. Each act of torture shifts the torturer's alignment one step toward evil, and it counts as a willful evil act for the purpose of effects like <em>atonement</em>.</p>\n<h1>Table 7-1: Torture Implements</h1>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Item</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Price</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><strong>WEIGHT</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\">Heretic's fork</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">10 gp</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">1 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\">Iron maiden</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">500 gp</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">300 lbs.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\">Rack</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">300 gp</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">500 lbs.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\">Rat cage</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">5 gp</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">15 lbs.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\">Thumbscrew</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">15 gp</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">1 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\">Thumbscrew, masterwork</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">50 gp</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">1 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\">Trephine</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">20 gp</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">1 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1>Heretic's Fork</h1>\n<p><strong>PRICE</strong> 10 GP; <strong>WEIGHT</strong> 1 lb.</p>\n<p>This device is a sharp, double-ended prong that is approximately 9 inches in length and fitted with a stout leather neckband. This nefarious device is secured on a helpless target's neck so the prongs pierce both the underside of the victim's chin and the victim's chest, dealing 1d6 points of nonlethal damage when the device is attached</p>\n<p>and an additional 1d6 points of nonlethal damage if the victim begins to fall asleep, effectively keeping the victim awake indefinitely and subjecting the victim to fatigue and exhaustion through sleep deprivation. A successful DC 22 Escape Artist check allows the victim to get free of the prongs without using his arms, though the heretic's fork remains strapped to his neck.</p>\n<h1>Iron Maiden</h1>\n<p><strong>PRICE</strong> 500 GP; <strong>WEIGHT</strong> 300 lbs.</p>\n<p>These dreadful devices are large, stylized iron coffins lined with sharp spikes used to torture and execute unfortunate victims. When a Small or Medium creature is forced within the iron maiden and the spiked doors are slammed shut, the creature is impaled on all sides by the iron spikes, immediately taking 3d6 points of piercing damage.</p>\n<h1>Rack</h1>\n<p><strong>PRICE</strong> 300 GP; <strong>WEIGHT</strong> 500 lbs.</p>\n<p>The rack is one of the most infamous and feared devices in the torturer's arsenal, capable of inflicting ruinous damage to a victim's body. Helpless victims are splayed across the device's frame, and each limb is lashed to a central windlass. Each turn of the crank deals a cumulative 1d6 points of nonlethal damage, up to 4d6 points of nonlethal damage on the fourth turn. Each subsequent turn after the fourth deals 4d6 points of nonlethal damage and deals 1 point of damage each to the victim's Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores as it dislocates limbs, cracks cartilage, and breaks bone. Some racks are fitted with spiked wheels that puncture the victim's body, dealing lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage. Escaping from a rack requires a successful DC 30 Escape Artist check.</p>\n<h1>Rat Cage</h1>\n<p><strong>PRICE</strong> 5 GP; <strong>WEIGHT</strong> 15 lbs.</p>\n<p>This specially crafted steel cage can hold up to 20 rats, and includes stout leather straps around its open end and a metal crucible for holding hot charcoal or other fuel on its top end. Torturers tightly strap the open end of the device to a helpless victim's abdomen, insert the rats into the cage, and set the crucible's fuel alight.</p>\n<p>In 1d10 rounds, the increasing heat causes the rats to gnaw and dig their way through the victim's abdomen to escape, dealing 1 point of piercing damage per rat each round. A victim can wiggle free of a rat cage with a successful DC 20 Escape Artist check, though some of the voracious vermin may continue their consumption in subsequent rounds.</p>\n<h1>Thumbscrew</h1>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Common</td>\n<td><strong>PRICE</strong> 15 GP</td>\n<td><strong>WEIGHT</strong> 1lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Masterwork</td>\n<td><strong>PRICE</strong> 50 GP</td>\n<td><strong>WEIGHT</strong> 1 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Both a torture and restraining device, this small, metal armature consists of two parallel, spike-studded bars that close together as the user tightens the frame's screws, crushing a victim's thumbs between them. A victim restrained by a thumbscrew is able to move but can't effectively wield weapons, hold items, or perform any actions or skill checks that require manual dexterity, taking a -5 penalty on all such actions and dealing 1d6 points of nonlethal</p>\n<p>damage to himself with each attempt (this doesn't include Escape Artist attempts to escape the thumbscrew). Spellcasters bound by thumbscrews are unable to cast spells with somatic components.</p>\n<p>When using a thumbscrew as a torture device, the user can turn the thumbscrew's bolt to deal 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Escaping from a thumbscrew requires a successful DC 28 Escape Artist check (DC 30 for a masterwork thumbscrew).</p>\n<h1>Trephine</h1>\n<p><strong>PRICE</strong> 20 GP; <strong>WEIGHT</strong> 1 lb.</p>\n<p>This surgical instrument has a serrated, circular blade that is used to bore holes into the skulls of patients to relieve cranial swelling from head trauma or, as some chirurgeons believe, release evil spirits. Use of a trephine takes 10 minutes, and deals 5 points of piercing damage to the subject creature.</p>\n<p>With a successful DC 25 Heal check, the user can heal up to 1d4 points of ability damage to any one mental ability score caused by physical trauma to the head, such as the critical called shot or debilitating blow called shot (<em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat </em>196), or it can cure the severe brain trauma inflicted by the debilitating blow called shot. If the user fails the check, the subject still takes 5 points of piercing damage. If the user fails the check by 5 or more, the subject instead takes 10 points of piercing damage and 1 point of damage each to its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores.</p>\n<p>^Horror Gear and Magic Items Bestiary</p>"}

Chapter 8: Bestiary}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Sinister, relentless, grotesque, and creepy, monsters define the tone of a horror game. From the purely physical threat of werewolves and zombies to the creeping corruption of vampires and devils, horror monsters can end or ruin the lives of heroes and background characters alike. A campaign can reflect the presence of monsters in any number of ways, whether it's a bloodbath in a serene village, a grand conspiracy crafted in the shadows, or an invasion by alien and unknowable creatures. This chapter includes the following entries, starting with new monsters and templates and ending with simple templates.</p>\n<p><strong>Dread Lord</strong>: The vile ruler of a grim and forsaken land, the dread lord exercises ultimate magical power over his realm. This template both changes the dread lord and corrupts the land he controls with new hazards.</p>\n<p><strong>Hive</strong>: The alien colonizers called the hive can infest living creatures in order to spawn more of their kind.</p>\n<p><strong>Implacable Stalker</strong>: Some monsters can't be stopped. They pursue their prey to the ends of the earth, instilling dread with every step. This template turns a monster into an undying, relentless hunter.</p>\n<p><strong>Kyton, Apostle</strong>: After hearing the maddening teachings of the kytons, a creature can become corrupted until it realigns its beliefs to accord with their philosophy. The slow erosion of its psyche can turn it into an apostle kyton with this template.</p>\n<p><strong>Trompe l'Oeil</strong>: A realistic painting brought to life, the trompe l'oeil comes forth from its frame to cause havoc, then returns with no one being the wiser. This template can be applied to a creature to represent a painted facsimile of that creature animated by magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Unknown</strong>: The lurking, patient fey called unknown follow their victims from the shadows. As its psyche erodes, a victim eventually transforms into another unknown, gaining the unknown template presented here.</p>\n<p><strong>Waxwork</strong>: This creature made of wax can pose as a living creature because its likeness is so accurate. The template here allows you to create such an impostor.</p>\n<p><strong>Simple Templates</strong>: This section includes a thematic simple template based on each of the corruptions appearing in Chapter 1, along with other template and variants appropriate to horror monsters.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

Chapter 5: Horror Rules}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While many Pathfinder campaigns tend to fixate on the monsters and NPCs that directly oppose the PCs, in a horror game, it's important to give the environment, atmosphere, and ambience equal billing. An appropriate environment can lead to a much deeper sense of horror and a more memorable session, since creatures are something the PCs usually fight and defeat directly, while the environment is pervasive and unstoppable. Use the following horrific locations, hazards, domains, and nightmare dreamscapes to build the tension and increase the growing dread the players feel.</p>\n<h1>Locations</h1>\n<p>The following locations have particular features that fit well in the context of a horror game, such as minor unusual magic or creepy special effects. Though they might not be directly threatening like the hazards in the next section (and thus don't possess their own CR), they nonetheless add an ambience of horror and a sense of unease to the game, and sometimes make the journey through the surrounding area much less pleasant.</p>\n<p><strong>Divining Water</strong>: Certain special bodies of water grant insight into the spirits of those reflected in them. The reflections of creatures that appear in divining water show each creature as though it were viewed with <em>true seeing</em>, bypassing any illusions or polymorph effects and revealing the creature's true form. However, either right away or after establishing their divinatory properties, the reflections sometimes shift to show images of horrific creatures (generally undead and evil outsiders) instead of creatures' true forms, especially when the viewer is in a state of fear or mental turmoil.</p>\n<p><strong>Faceless Statue</strong>: These specially created stone statues are humanoid in appearance and elegantly carved, but they stand out because of their completely blank visages, which appear as though the sculptor simply forgot to give them faces. Whenever a character casts <em>project image </em>within range of such a statue, she can project her image onto the statue, instead of creating the spell's normal effect. This causes the statue's blank face to transform into that of the caster, and the statue mimics the caster's actions, rather than a projected image doing so. The statue has a movement speed of 0 feet, but a caster projecting her image through the statue can direct it to make up to two slam attacks per round as a full-round action, using the caster's base attack bonus. The slam attacks each deal 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage. A <em>project image </em>spell cast in this way has a duration measured in minutes, rather than rounds, and the caster isn't required to maintain line of effect to the projected image at all times. A faceless statue can also be affected by <em>enter image</em>(APG), causing the faceless surface to transform into an image of the caster's face for the duration of the spell, instead of producing the spell's normal effects.</p>\n<p>The statue's hardness is based on the type of material from which it is made. Dealing an amount of damage to the statue equal to double the caster's caster level ends either of the special spell effects channeled through the faceless statue.</p>\n<p><strong>Godless Void</strong>: Godless voids are pockets of altered reality that typically infest ruined temples, forsaken battlefields, and churches that fell from grace through the blasphemous deeds of corrupted worshipers. Even the divine might of deities is denied influence within these voids. The radius of a godless void is usually 1d6 x 100 feet. Within lesser godless voids, divine spells become more difficult to cast, and a divine caster must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + the level of the spell) for a spell to function normally. If the caster fails, the spell doesn't function, but the prepared spell or spell slot is still lost. In addition, the DC to resist channeled energy of all sorts is reduced by 4. Greater godless voids are more troublesome, as all divine magic melts away within them, so divine casters must operate totally cut off from their god, as if within an <em>antimagic field</em>.</p>\n<p>Selective godless voids exist, though they are rarer still than their normal counterparts. Such blasphemous sites affect divine casters of alignments opposed to the void's influence or who worship a deity or belong to a religion opposed to the void's influence. For instance, evil lesser godless voids impede good-aligned casters' access to spells and weaken their ability to channel positive energy as described above, while evil greater voids totally cut off spells and class abilities from good-aligned divine casters or casters who gain their powers from good-aligned deities. Good-aligned godless voids, or those aligned to law or chaos, are less common. Godless voids created by a great blasphemy against a particular deity might affect only that particular deity's power.</p>\n<p><strong>Grave</strong>: Macabre reminders of mortality, a grave could be found among many more within a necropolis or alone on a windswept hill. Digging a grave (4-1/2 to 6-1/2 feet deep) in typical soil takes 1d4 hours, while digging a grave in frozen or otherwise harder-than-average soil takes 2d6 hours. Without standard digging equipment, these times are doubled. Climbing out of an open grave usually takes a move action and a successful DC 5 Climb check (plus another move action to stand if the creature started out lying down).</p>\n<p>Careful examination of the surrounding area can reveal the presence of an unmarked grave or provide insight into how long ago a grave was dug. A successful DC 15 Perception check allows a character to notice an area of recently disturbed earth. For every week since the soil was disturbed, and for every day of rain since the soil was disturbed, the DC increases by 1. A successful DC 20 Profession (gardener, gravedigger, or other similar profession) or Survival check allows a character examining a patch of recently disturbed earth to determine roughly how long ago it was disturbed, as long as it was disturbed no more than 1 year ago.</p>\n<p>If a character is buried alive, perhaps by the buried alive haunt (see page 175), the rules suggestions on page 206 give an idea of what that character needs to do claw her way out of an early grave.</p>\n<p><strong>Holy Ground</strong>: When first constructed, most good-aligned churches, temples, and holy sites are consecrated by the religion's clergy in elaborate and expensive blessing ceremonies, culminating in the casting of a <em>hallow </em>spell. This effect permanently wards the site with a <em>magic circle against evil </em>effect, bolsters channeled positive energy while reducing the effects of channeled negative energy, and protects interred bodies from turning into undead abominations. The magic circle prevents intrusion by evil summoned creatures, and GMs may rule that other evil creatures refuse to trespass on holy ground. This <em>hallow </em>spell also carries the protection of an additional spell for the first year-most often <em>aid</em>, <em>bless</em>, <em>death ward</em>, <em>dimensional anchor</em>, or <em>zone of truth</em>. The temple's attendants usually renew this spell in a special ceremony each year on the anniversary of the blessing ceremony, but the effect isn't in place for churches that have fallen into disrepair or been abandoned by their faiths. However, the remaining lingering <em>hallow </em>effect in a ruined holy site might still provide sanctuary for those seeking respite from dark forces.</p>\n<p>The lingering presence of evil in or near a holy site can slowly undermine and eventually dispel the <em>hallow </em>effect. This usually takes years or decades, and even a small amount of resistance by pure-hearted attendants can protect the site.</p>\n<p>Evil denominations also perform rituals to increase the power of their unholy sites, but with the exact opposite effects, replacing <em>hallow </em>with <em>unhallow</em>, and providing similar protections against good creatures. Evil clergy are more likely to utilize detrimental additional effects like <em>bane </em>or <em>cause fear </em>to discourage trespassers on their unholy ground or even more powerful spells like <em>dimensional anchor </em>to ensure the trespassers will never leave.</p>\n<p><strong>Lost Halls</strong>: The corridors of some decrepit mansions can mislead those who seek to discover their hidden secrets. Within these lost halls, doors vanish, corridors impossibly twist and turn, staircases climb endlessly, and passages appear and disappear to confuse explorers. Creatures caught in lost halls find themselves temporarily trapped in an extradimensional labyrinth. For each round spent exploring the twisting turns, an affected creature can attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check as a full-round action to find its way back to the point where it originally became lost. During this time, others might hear it calling out, but can't see or detect the lost creature. The phenomenon is short-lived, so if the creature finds itself hopelessly lost, 10 minutes later it finds its way back to the point where it first disappeared. This phenomenon can affect multiple creatures at once, in which case they can hear the disturbing echoes of other lost creatures trying to extract themselves from the twisting halls, but they can't otherwise interact with or assist their allies in any way. Unlike most of the other locations in this section, a lost halls phenomenon is normally harmless, if extremely unsettling, but when populated with creatures that target the separated characters, lost halls can substantially alter the threat of encounters.</p>\n<h1>Hazards</h1>\n<p>The following hazards help build an atmosphere of horror and dread when used separately, but can also be combined with creatures to create truly frightening and memorable encounters (for instance, consider a battle with ogres within an animating fog, such that each ogre that dies rises again as a zombie).</p>\n<p><strong>Animating Fog (CR 6)</strong>: Arising from polluted cemeteries and other recesses of stagnated evil, these areas of heavy, corpse-gray fog reek of rot, and seem to have a strange and malevolent sentience. These fog banks act as normal fog (<em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook </em>439), but usually have a radius of 1d4 x 50 feet and creep along with the wind at a rate of 10 feet per round. When the fog comes into contact with a mostly intact corpse, that corpse is immediately animated as a zombie and attacks nearby living creatures, as if under the effect of <em>animate dead</em>. This animation is temporary, ending 1d4 rounds after the zombie leaves the fog. Corpse fogs can animate up to 30 Hit Dice of corpses in this manner at any one time, and they have no limit on the total number of Hit Dice of zombies they can animate over time.</p>\n<p>Some particularly foul and virulent variations of this fog (CR 7 instead of CR 6) produce plague zombies instead of normal zombies. Creatures slain by the plague zombies' zombie rot who rise as zombies don't count against the fog's limit on the number of Hit Dice it can animate, and they remain zombies after the mist passes. Diseased animating fog also exposes every living creature within the fog bank to zombie rot each round as an inhaled disease (Fortitude DC 15 negates).</p>\n<p><strong>Apocalypse Fog (CR 12)</strong>: An apocalypse fog is an augmented and highly dangerous form of animating fog often called into being by some foul deity. Its radius is 20 times wider than that of an animating fog and has the same ability to animate the mostly intact corpses within itself, but the apocalypse fog can move 10 feet in a direction of its own malign choice, rather than being subject to the whims of the wind. The dread energies that birth the mists bolster the undead within, granting the zombies the benefit of an aligned <em>desecrate </em>spell: a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws, and +2 hit points per Hit Die. Apocalypse fog can animate up to 100 Hit Dice worth of corpses at any one time.</p>\n<p><strong>Bat Colony (CR 2)</strong>: Bats often congregate in large colonies in underground areas. Though bats are mostly harmless and bat colonies generally have little interest in adventurers or humans in general, if they are disturbed, they can prove dangerous to inexperienced adventurers. Any Small or larger creature moving within 30 feet of a bat colony must succeed at a DC 15 Stealth check each round or use wild empathy or a similar ability to keep the bats calm, or else there is a 50% chance the bat colony becomes disturbed. Additionally, each round the bat colony is exposed to normal or brighter light conditions or loud sudden noises, there is a 30% chance the bat colony becomes disturbed.</p>\n<p>If the bat colony is disturbed, the bats begin to fly about, shrieking and milling in an oversized swarm. When disturbed, the colony takes up a 20-foot-radius area. A creature that ends its turn in the area takes 1d6 points of damage, and is affected by the distraction and wounding special abilities of a bat swarm (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </em>30). The colony remains disturbed for 1d4+1 rounds (or until the swarm is dispersed by damage), after which the bats either return to their previous position or flee the area, depending on whether they feel a threat is still present.</p>\n<p><strong>Blood Moon (CR 3)</strong>: Two situations give rise to the infamous occurrences known as blood moons: astronomical alignments that result in a calendar month having a second full moon, and atmospheric phenomena when pollution and toxins hang heavy in the air, distorting the rising moon and giving it a blood-red cast and a seemingly larger size. Both types of occurrences are considered bad omens, and are revered as unholy events by worshipers of deities of filth and decay. While the light of a blood moon shines, the DC to resist negative channeled energy increases by 2, and creatures exposed to its light take a -2 penalty on saving throws against diseases, curses, corruptions (see page 14), and madnesses (see page 182). Certain foul occult rituals related to such magic must be performed on blood moons.</p>\n<p>Blood moons caused by astronomical alignments last as long as the moon is risen, while blood moons that result from atmospheric distortions last 1d4 hours, fading as the moon rises higher in the night sky and casts off its ruddy sheen.</p>\n<p><strong>Bottomless Pit (CR 9)</strong>: A bottomless pit is a yawning chasm that appears to be a perfectly natural fissure in the earth, other than the fact that it appears too deep to see the bottom. In actuality, bottomless pits are entrances to extraplanar spaces filled with nothing but endless empty void. A creature that falls into such a pit (whether it is pushed, runs afoul of a trap that conceals the bottomless pit, willingly dives into it, or enters the pit in some other fashion) falls endlessly in inky darkness at a rate of 500 feet per round. Other than its depth, the extraplanar space's dimensions match those of the pit's entrance, and the falling creature can attempt to catch itself on the wall, using the Climb skill (DC = 20 + the wall's Climb DC, as normal for catching yourself when falling), and can attempt to climb out of the pit from there. The wall's climb DC typically matches the type of terrain the opening was in, so a rocky chasm has a Climb DC of 15, for example. The creature can attempt to catch itself once per round. Because the creature falls endlessly, it can rest and even prepare spells while falling (although it must be careful not to drop any possessions, since it will likely fall at a different speed than the possessions do, causing it to lose them forever). If a campaign uses the sanity system (see page 12), for each hour a creature falls in the bottomless pit, it must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or take 1d4 points of sanity damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Captivating Reflection (CR 3)</strong>: Some narcissistic people need little encouragement to stop and admire their visage in the surface of the water, but occasionally this behavior comes from the bizarre supernatural influence of the water itself. A creature that sees its reflection in the surface of this captivating water must succeed at a DC 15 Will saving throw or become fascinated by the reflection for 1 minute, after which it can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect and look away. A creature that fails the second saving throw is fascinated for another minute, kneeling by the surface of the water and staring at its reflection, its nose nearly touching the surface. At the end of this time, the creature can attempt a third saving throw to end the effect. If the creature fails this third and final saving throw, it is compelled to plunge its head under the water, at which point the fascination suddenly ends, but the creature is paralyzed for 1 minute, unable to hold its breath because of paralysis and therefore immediately forced to attempt Constitution checks to avoid drowning <em>(Core Rulebook </em>445).</p>\n<p>The creature's allies can pull its head from the water, but meet with surprising resistance, and must succeed at a DC 20 Strength check to do so, regardless of the paralyzed creature's own Strength score. If the creature avoids drowning by the end of the third minute, it can thereafter act normally, and is immune to the effects of this particular captivating reflection hazard for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Corpsefruit Tree (CR 5)</strong>: This gnarled, twisted tree grows only from ground containing the corpse of an intelligent creature (a creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher), providing an insidious tether that binds that creature's spirit to the world of the living and twists it toward malevolent spite. The tree is shrouded by a veil of illusion, which causes intelligent creatures that see the tree to believe it bears a heavy bounty of ripe, succulent fruits, and such creatures are compelled to eat the tree's fruit unless they succeed at a DC 15 Will save. In fact, the tree's fruits are brown, shriveled, and rotten, and any creature that succeeds at the Will save can plainly see this.</p>\n<p>Creatures that consume the fruit also consume a tiny portion of the spirit of the creature whose corpse nourished the tree, forging a spiritual connection between the deceased and the unfortunate victim. The next time the creature rests, it is affected as though by the <em>nightmare </em>spell (DC 17). The tree is treated as having a body part of the creature's, and the tree uses the appropriate modifier based on the knowledge the spirit that nourished the tree has of the creature-typically none. The victim continues to be affected by <em>nightmare </em>for 3 days, or until it succeeds at a saving throw to resist the spell. Further, if the spirit of the creature whose corpse nourished the tree has become an incorporeal undead of any kind, the creature that consumed the fruit takes a -2 penalty on saving throws to resist the spells and spell-like abilities of that undead creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Exploding Window (CR 1)</strong>: Whether from supernatural influence or simply from more mundane physical forces, windows can sometimes explode in a rain of glass shards. When this occurs, for each 5-foot square containing an exploding window, the shattered glass blasts out in a 15- foot cone that deals 1d6 points of slashing damage to each creature in the area (Reflex DC 12 negates). A creature caught in more than one of these cones (either from multiple simultaneous exploding windows or one large exploding window) takes a cumulative -1 penalty on its saving throw for each cone beyond the first, but attempts only a single saving throw and takes only 1d6 points of damage if it fails, regardless of the number of cones whose areas overlap on the creature's space. Additionally, the glass shards remain on the ground, functioning as caltrops until they are cleared away.</p>\n<p><strong>Field of Bone (CR 6)</strong>: This supernatural hazard usually plagues those who trespass on old battlefields still littered with the bones of soldiers who have never been laid to proper rest. These 30-foot-radius patches of strewn bones are considered difficult terrain, and they spring to a foul mockery of life 1 round after a living creature enters the area, causing 1d6 skeletons (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </em>250) to animate and attack, as if subject to an <em>animate dead </em>spell. A field of bone can animate up to 24 skeletons in this manner from any single instance of trespassing (regardless of how many living creatures trespass into the area at once), at a rate of 1d6 skeletons per round. The skeletons continue to animate until all are destroyed, all living creatures leave the area, or the field of bone reaches its animation limit, whichever of these conditions comes first.</p>\n<p><strong>Gnarled Tree (CR 5)</strong>: Some trees become poisoned and malignant, tainted by the corrupt land around them, and spring to a macabre semblance of animation to attack those who trespass on their dark realms. Gnarled trees animate in the presence of living creatures, and attack indiscriminately for as long as creatures are within range. The victims' spilled blood seeping into the ground further feeds the trees' corruption. Gnarled trees appear as twisted, or even dead, trees of great age and a variety of species, and they blend in with the surrounding forests. Spotting one as an anomalous growth requires a successful DC 17 Perception check (the DC may be higher, depending on the prevalence and condition of local trees). Though a gnarled tree is stationary and can't move from its rooted spot, it attacks as if it were a treant.</p>\n<p>The gnarled tree doesn't gain the treant's animation and rock-throwing abilities, but does have the treant's vulnerability to fire. When all living creatures move more than 30 feet away from the gnarled tree, it immediately returns to its normal, nonanimated state, until a potential target appears within range once more and provokes the corrupted tree's ire again.</p>\n<p><strong>Grasping Graves (CR 4)</strong>: Treading on the burial sites of the unquiet dead can be treacherous, as the buried dead seek to drag the living down into their restless graves. These patches of shallow graves are often found near sites of mass burials, such as those that follow plagues or famines, and are typically 60 feet across. Once a creature enters the area, rotting, grasping hands rip from the earth, turning the entire patch into difficult terrain and targeting each creature inside with a grapple combat maneuver check each round at the end of that creature's turn. The hands don't provoke attacks of opportunity, and have a CMB of +12 (with a base attack bonus of +8 and a +4 bonus due to their Strength). This check is attempted each round for every creature in the hazardous area.</p>\n<p>If the hands successfully grapple a creature, that creature takes 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage, gains the grappled condition, and is unable to move without breaking the grapple first. The grasping claws receive a +5 bonus on grapple checks against creatures they are already grappling, but can't move or pin foes. Each round the grasping claws succeed at a grapple check, they deal 1d6+4 additional points of damage. The skeletal hands have a CMD of 22, hardness 5, and 5 hit points each. The hands take full damage from channeled positive energy (no save). However, destroying a particular set of hands doesn't harm the overall hazard, which generates new skeletal hands to grasp all creatures freed in this way on the following round. The only way to evade the hazard is to move out of the affected area, after which the unquiet spirits that animate the grasping graves become dormant once again.</p>\n<p><strong>Grasping Undergrowth (CR 2)</strong>: In many forests, undergrowth is thick and tangled enough that it seems to be attempting to hinder travelers, but in some places, whether due to a malevolent spirit or the ire of nature itself, it actually is. Whenever a creature moves through an area of grasping undergrowth, the grasping undergrowth attempts a trip combat maneuver check (with a CMB of +5) against that creature. Tripped creatures fall prone in the first square of grasping undergrowth that they entered that round, and lose the rest of their movement. Creatures that move through the grasping undergrowth at half their speed (after factoring in any reduced movement speed for being in a forest) gain a +4 bonus to their CMD against trip combat maneuver checks from the grasping undergrowth, and creatures that move through the grasping undergrowth at a quarter of their speed gain a +8 bonus.</p>\n<p>If a creature begins its turn prone in a square of grasping undergrowth, the grasping undergrowth attempts a grapple combat maneuver check against it, dealing 1d6 points of damage on a successful check and preventing the creature from moving from the spot until it breaks free of the grapple. The undergrowth can't move or pin the grappled creature on subsequent rounds, and has a CMD of 17. For their own cryptic reasons, some patches of grasping undergrowth grant safe passage to characters of certain alignments or races.</p>\n<p><strong>Insidious Domicile (CR 4)</strong>: The dwellings of some powerful evil creatures impose pervasive effects on those who disturb the restless hate that dwells within. These areas are typically single structures-a castle, a tower, or a home-infested with spite and malice. Creatures that enter the structure must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be infected with overwhelming hate toward another creature, as if under the effects of <em>malicious spite</em>(UM). For each day spent within the domicile, the target takes 2 points of Wisdom damage if it doesn't act to subtly and indirectly slander, abuse, blame, extort, or cause mortal violence against the target of its spite. The <em>malicious spite </em>effect ends if the creature leaves the location, but resumes if the creature returns. Affected creatures get a saving throw every 24 hours to negate the effect. If the effect ends, the target remembers the spiteful behavior, but not the motivation for it.</p>\n<p>If a campaign uses the sanity system (see page 12), the target takes 1d6 points of sanity damage instead of taking Wisdom damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Misleading Echoes (CR 2)</strong>: Some places create supernatural echoes that seem to come from random directions, or even all directions at once. An area suffused with misleading echoes imposes a -4 penalty on hearing-based Perception checks, and a listener must succeed at a DC 15 Wisdom check whenever she detects a noise, or else she believes the noise came from a random direction instead of its actual direction. Further, the misleading echoes can replicate the effects of <em>ghost sound </em>(DC 11) once per minute. Any creature that fails a Wisdom check or Will save to resist the effects of the misleading echoes takes a -2 penalty on saving throws to resist fear effects for as long as it remains in the area of the misleading echoes, and for 1 minute thereafter.</p>\n<p><strong>Misleading Path (CR 3)</strong>: When the surrounding trees begin to move and change the paths when creatures aren't looking, and the towering branches above even block out the sun, it can be difficult indeed to stay on track. In other environments, shifting dunes or underground tunnels can have the same effect. The DC for Survival checks to avoid becoming lost within an area of misleading paths increases by 2d6. Characters that become lost either travel in random directions, as normal, or are led by a strange intelligence toward a specific location, at the GM's discretion. Because travelers appear to be on a path as they travel, the DC of the Survival check to identify that they are lost increases to 25.</p>\n<p><strong>Pervasive Gloom (CR 4)</strong>: Some locations ooze dread and foreboding, whether from old evils left to stagnate or the presence of some lingering psychic residue from years of torture or oppression. The locations can be single rooms, entire structures, old cemeteries, or even decaying forest groves. Trespassing creatures find the gloom nibbles away at their mental defenses, and take a -2 penalty on saves against fear effects, effects with the emotion(UM) descriptor, the effects of haunts, the progression of corruptions (see page 15), madnesses (see page 182), and sanity damage (see page 12).</p>\n<p><strong>Plague of Flies (CR 2)</strong>: Often harbingers of famine and decay, these swarms of flies spread disease and pestilence wherever their buzzing wings carry them. These insects typically form a cloud 20 feet across, made of tens of thousands of flies. This cloud moves at up to 10 feet per round, and obscures all sight (including darkvision) beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment (20% miss chance), and creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target). Moderate or stronger winds can temporarily disperse the cloud, as per <em>obscuring mist</em>, but the flies reform 1d4+1 rounds later to continue their pursuit of carrion. Spells such as <em>fireball, flame strike</em>, and <em>wall of fire</em>, as well as similar area spells, destroy the cloud of flies if they deal at least 10 points of damage. Creatures that spend at least 1 round in the cloud must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or contract the shakes (<em>Core Rulebook </em>557). Some plagues of flies carry other virulent diseases instead, which might affect the CR of the hazard if the DC is significantly higher or lower.</p>\n<p><strong>Rain of Gore (CR 3)</strong>: This unusual and unsettling phenomenon results in the corpses of small animals (ranging from Diminutive to Small) falling from the sky in a localized area. A rain of gore generally covers a 500-foot-radius area, and lasts for 2d4 x 10 minutes. During this time, each round that a character remains in the open, it takes 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage unless it succeeds at a DC 13 Reflex save. In the wake of a rain of gore, scores of animal corpses are left strewn about in the area. Sometimes, a rain of gore will deposit animal corpses that are infected with filth fever or another disease, in which case each time characters take damage from the rain of gore, they risk infection. This version of the hazard has a CR of 4 or higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Sanguinary Cloud (CR 6)</strong>: Often found floating over campsites of unfortunate travelers drained of all bodily fluids, these blood-red fog banks can be mistaken for colossal vampiric mists (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 </em>277). A sanguinary cloud typically settles over a 60-foot-radius area, obscuring all sight beyond 5 feet, including darkvision, granting concealment (20% miss chance) to all creatures 5 feet away or farther. Creatures caught within a bank of this deadly fog must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save each round or take 1d3 points of Constitution damage as their bodily fluids are forcibly extracted from their pores and mucous membranes and drawn into the crimson mist. A severe or greater wind disperses a sanguinary cloud, leaving behind a thin sheen of bloody bile.</p>\n<p><strong>Sour Ground (CR varies)</strong>: These corrupted holy sites usually feature long-toppled standing stones and spiraling rock paths carefully arranged by a forgotten culture to invoke powerful divine magic. On these grounds, divine casters restored life to those who died before their time and buried those whose time indeed was up. However, time, overuse, and trespassers caused the ground's life-giving properties to sour, corrupting the corpses of those whose loved ones are foolhardy enough to lay them to rest within the necropolis's boundaries. Any mostly intact corpse of a creature buried within these ancient cemeteries animates 24 hours later as a juju zombie (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 </em>291) and seeks its revenge on those who condemned its corpse to this vile existence. These terrible creatures still retain a semblance of their former personalities and are often barely distinguishable from the living with the exception of cold flesh, slightly sunken features, distracted behavior, and an increasingly foul smell. They lure in mourning loved ones with comforting embraces before engaging in a murderous rampage, perhaps burying the resulting corpses in the same sour ground to increase their numbers and extract more revenge on the living. The CR and the XP reward of sour ground are based on the number of juju zombies that arise.</p>\n<p><strong>Suicide Copse (CR 4)</strong>: Certain forests are known for attracting unusual numbers of suicides. The exact cause can vary, and may be the result of mind-altering pollen, strange psychic phenomena, or the work of mournful or malevolent spirits. Whatever the cause, suicide copses don't so much attract suicidal creatures as inspire suicide in those nearby. Each hour a creature spends within the suicide copse, it must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be affected by the spell <em>terrible remorse</em>(UM) (CL 10). A creature that succeeds at this saving throw three consecutive times is immune to this effect for 24 hours. At the GM's discretion, some creatures affected by the suicide copse might be compelled to hang themselves, drown themselves, or kill themselves by other means, rather than being affected by <em>terrible remorse</em>, but such compulsions still last only 1 minute. Though called a copse, this effect can potentially cover entire forests spanning hundreds of square miles.</p>\n<p><strong>Watchful Doll (CR 1)</strong>: These porcelain dolls resemble young children, and stare forward with blank, glassy expressions on their stylized yet eerily lifelike faces. Whenever a creature moves within 30 feet of a watchful doll, the doll's head rotates to face the creature, and emits a childlike laugh that echoes as if across a great distance, and can be clearly heard up to 60 feet away. Creatures within 30 feet that hear the laughter must succeed at a Will save (DC 13) or be shaken for 1 minute. Creatures with 4 or fewer Hit Dice that fail their saves are instead frightened. Once triggered, the doll doesn't laugh again for 1 minute, but its head continues to move so its gaze follows the creature that triggered it. The fear from the laughter is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Well of Evil (CR 5)</strong>: These places are accursed morasses of depravity, nexuses of lingering hate and festering evil that bode ill for the pure-hearted who trespass upon them. A well of evil is typically a single room, cave, or structure, though it can expand to fill an area with a radius of up to 2d4 x 10 feet. Good-aligned creatures can feel the powerful evil presence tainting a well of evil, and such creatures that approach within 30 feet must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become sickened and refuse to enter the location for 1 hour. A successful Will save negates these unfortunate effects, but if the creature actually enters the location, it becomes sickened with no save. Within a well of evil, the DC to resist negative channeled energy increases by 2, and good-aligned creatures take a -2 penalty on saving throws against curses, corruptions (see page 14), madnesses (see page 182), spells with the evil descriptor, and the effects of haunts. Haunts that lurk within wells of evil also gain a +4 bonus on their Initiative checks and to Perception check DCs to notice them.</p>\n<p><strong>Witch Light (CR 1)</strong>: Often confused with will-o'- wisps, these shimmering lights also tend to lead unwary passersby to their dooms. Witch lights appear as flickering lights resembling lantern or torch flames, but can be seen only with a successful DC 10 Perception check. A result of 30 or higher on the Perception check allows the viewer to identify the witch light as a mirage. The witch light seems to move with the viewer, retreating if the creature moves toward it and following if it moves away. Some witch lights have a mind of their own, or are controlled by malevolent entities, and lead viewers toward specific places-often pits or other hazards, but sometimes treasures or long-buried secrets. Creatures actively following a witch light take a -4 penalty on Perception checks and a -4 penalty on Reflex saves to resist the effects of traps and hazards.</p>\n<h1>Domains of Evil</h1>\n<p>Some powerful creatures are so corrupted that their malignancy creeps into the land around them, establishing dangerous domains of evil over which they rule. And though some vile lords find themselves trapped within these cursed realms, they also become capable of exerting tremendous influence over the atmosphere and composition of their domains, such that their lands grow to reflect their dark moods and deeds. These dark rulers are described in the dread lord template on page 234.</p>\n<p>Domains of evil are dark pockets of supernatural activity embedded in a plane (often the Material Plane) like boils on pockmarked flesh. Most domains are hostile and uninviting at best, full of twisted forests, rough and intractable terrain, and putrid rivers that reek of rot and pollution. Wildlife could be similarly tainted, in which case even the occasional hare or ground squirrel is bony, cancerous, and infested with vermin. Packs of mangy coyotes, pustule-plagued wolves, and murders of molting crows might constantly harass travelers, nipping at their heels, ripping the flanks of their mounts, or snatching at the fingers of careless campers.</p>\n<p>Supernatural creatures might also plague the unwary, as moaning zombies wander wind-blown mountain passes and spectral dead seek to drain the life from the living at every turn. Packs of ghouls roam the lowlands, devouring entire villages, and the gnawed skeletons they leave in their wake animate and attack travelers. Everywhere lurks the foreboding presence of some foul master, who has an uncanny knack for knowing the whereabouts of trespassers and is capable of bending the lands to his will to make them most unwelcome.</p>\n<p>Such domains are not always devoid of humanoid populations-they may harbor villages of fearful and superstitious locals that usually serve as chattel and livestock for the domain's lord. These populations tend to be incredibly insular and suspicious of outsiders and intrusions on their lifestyles, as trespassers into the realm-particularly adventurers-have ways of disrupting the locals' tentative impasse with their lord.</p>\n<h2>Domain Geography</h2>\n<p>When created, a domain of evil warps reality around it into a foul reflection of its master, with a radius of 5 miles for every Hit Die of its new lord (see the dread lord template on page 234). This radius usually centers on an ancient ancestral manse or cursed cairn that housed the dread lord's family or was the scene of a tragedy that led to the domain's creation. Though domains of evil are still located on their original plane (usually the Material Plane), with all the terrain, weather, flora, fauna, structures, and features normal to the area where they were created, their special natures cause them to have planar traits (<em>Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide </em>184) that alter their physical and magical properties, as well as some features exclusive to them. Domains of evil have the following features, as befits the horrible creatures that preside over these realms.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: If its master has 10 Hit Dice or fewer, a domain gains the mildly aligned planar alignment trait reflecting the alignment of its master. Domains with masters with more than 10 Hit Dice instead become strongly aligned.</p>\n<p><strong>Borders</strong>: Some domains are formed simply by the foul presence of an evil that has long inhabited the land, whether it's a nosferatu lord lurking in the shadows or a restless ghost bound to the soil of its unquiet grave. The borders of such a domain are open; creatures can freely enter and leave, and its lord can pass to and from its domain without penalty, though the influence he has over his lands doesn't extend past the domain's established borders. Other domains of evil serve as torturous prisons for their cursed lords (see Cursed Domains on page 161), who find it impossible to leave the realms to which they are bound, oftentimes hindered by a pervasive bank of dread fog (see page 161) that prevents their egress. These mists resist intrusion into the domain, though the strange whims of dark powers might allow passage through the fog for those who might further trouble or torment the land's lord.</p>\n<p><strong>Disturbing to Animals</strong>: The overwhelming taint of unnatural presences disturbs animals that are not native to a domain of evil. Animals don't willingly approach the domain's border unless their masters succeed at DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy checks, and the masters must continue to attempt checks each hour within the domain to prevent their animals from trying to leave the area. The DCs of all other Handle Animal, Ride, and wild empathy checks to influence nonnative animals increase by 5 while the animals remain within the domain's border.</p>\n<p><strong>Hazards</strong>: The domain morphs into a dark and twisted reflection of its lord, with dangerous landmarks and supernatural hazards (such as the ones on pages 154-159) mirroring the master's temperament and personality infesting the landscape. Forests might become darker and more foreboding, full of misleading paths or gnarled oaks that grasp and tear at trespassers. Seemingly sentient fogs drift across the crags and crevices of the land, animating undead in their wakes, while bat colonies infest the domain's caves and ruins. These hazards can shift and change over time as the land reacts to the moods and whims of the dread lord (a slow process that takes at least 24 hours, during which no hazard functions), but the total CR of all hazards found with a lord's domain (that is, the CR of a hypothetical encounter with all of the hazards at once) can't exceed double the dread lord's Hit Dice, and no individual hazard can have a CR that exceeds the dread lord's Hit Dice. If the land is the domain of a cursed lord and bordered by dread fog (see page 161), the fog's CR value doesn't count against this limit.</p>\n<p><strong>Magic</strong>: The domain can have the enhanced magic, impeded magic, or wild magic planar trait, as befits the personality and temperament of its lord. If the domain has enhanced, impeded, or limited magic, one type of magic per 5 Hit Dice of its lord can be enhanced, impeded, or limited. The categories of magic that are affected are relatively narrow. For example, an entire school of magic would be too broad, but \"effects with the healing descriptor or that restore hit points\" or \"death spells and spells granted by the Death and Repose domains\" would be appropriate. A type of spell can't be both enhanced and impeded by the same domain.</p>\n<p><strong>Time</strong>: A domain's time passes at the normal rate by default. In some cases, the lord's powerful whims alter the passage of time, whether replicating the slow churning of years felt by a lich's long existence, or the quickening felt by a blood-sated vampire. This alteration can be temporary or permanent, and the domain can have the erratic time, flowing time (half or double normal time), or timeless trait.</p>\n<h2>Cursed Domains</h2>\n<p>Though many dread lords so embrace their inherent evil that they slowly corrupt the lands around them, others perform deeds so horrendous that gods, the universe, fate, or another powerful force curses them to internal imprisonment in a domain. There is no escape for a cursed lord, who is continuously subject to living and spectral reminders of the tragic misdeeds that trapped him (see the cursed lord template on page 235). These realms have all the qualities of domains of evil, with the following additional traits.</p>\n<p><strong>Dread Fog</strong>: This cloying mist often encapsulates the boundaries of cursed domains, raised by terrible powers to prevent entry into, or escape from, the cursed lands they protect. Like normal fog, these pervasive banks of thick mists obscure all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet, granting concealment to all creatures at least 5 feet away (20% miss chance). Navigation and orientation within the mists is treacherous, and creatures usually find themselves easily separated from their companions unless extraordinary means are taken to prevent separation, which can include shackling or binding adjacent creatures to one another with rope. Those within the fog have little hope of navigating the mists and risk becoming hopelessly lost. A creature must succeed at a DC 20 Intelligence check each hour after entering the mist. Creatures that fail continue to wander in the fog until they succeed. Creatures that succeed exit the fog 1d10 x 100 feet from the location where they first entered the miasma. Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as <em>teleport </em>and <em>dimension door, </em>don't help a creature escape this fog, although a <em>plane shift </em>spell allows the creature to exit at the location it originally entered the fog. Penetrating the fog to actually enter or exit the realm it protects is subject to the GM's discretion. Navigating through might require difficult Knowledge (planes) checks, random happenstance, complicated arcane rituals beseeching favor, or simply the desire of the mysterious entities responsible for the cursed realm's creation to see the torture of their prisoner ended or increased with the intrusion of the adventurers.</p>\n<p>The fog's hopelessness is pervasive, and creatures take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per hour they are within the fog. The wraiths and geists of those who have perished in the mists might also materialize to drain the life from travelers. Those who lose their lives within this miasma are forever lost, incapable of being restored to life by any means short of direct divine intervention. They often turn into incorporeal undead themselves, their souls feeding the strange boundary's continued existence.</p>\n<p><strong>Haunted Lands</strong>: Cursed lords are plagued with the spectres of the acts that led to the creation of the domain, which materialize as haunts. The realm of a brutal dictator might be tormented with the haunts of those he tortured to death, reflecting the various violent means by which they were killed. The domain of a lich cursed for sacrificing her entire family to fuel her transformation into undeath may contain the spirits of those she betrayed, who wander the halls of a ruined manse at the core of the land. The cursed lord has no control over these spectral trespassers, placed to remind him of his former misdeeds. When a cursed realm is created, the domain manifests a number of haunts with a total CR value (that is, the CR of a hypothetical encounter with all of the hazards at once) of up to double the cursed lord's Hit Dice, with no single haunt having a CR that exceeds the cursed lord's Hit Dice. These haunts are chained (<em>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures </em>229) to the cursed lord and can't be completely destroyed while the cursed lord still exists. Other haunts not chained to the cursed lord might manifest within the domain of evil, but such haunts don't count against the CR limit.</p>\n<h1>Horrific Traps</h1>\n<p>Complicated and elaborate death traps can easily invoke horror in their victims. Trap makers with a sadistic bent go out of their way to create traps that kill their victims in particularly gruesome and unusual manners, sometimes even at the expense of the trap's efficacy. The following section presents a handful of macabre and horrific traps.</p>\n<h2>CRUSHING CAGE TRAP CR 11</h2>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>mechanical; <strong>Perception </strong>DC 29; <strong>Disable Device </strong>DC 30</p>\n<p>EFFECTS</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger </strong>location; <strong>Reset </strong>manual</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>A metal cage drops to seal creatures in a 10 -foot-square area (no saving throw), and the ceiling of this cage begins to slowly lower to crush those within it , descending at a rate of 1 foot per round from a height of 10 feet. Creatures inside and outside the trapped area can attempt to open the cage's single locked door (Disable Device DC 30), but the lock is electrified, automatically dealing 6d6 points of electricity damage with each attempt, and imposing a -1 penalty on the check for every 5 points of damage dealt in this way. Creatures inside the cage can attempt to hold up the ceiling of the cage as a full-round action with a successful DC 25 Strength check. Success prevents the cage from lowering that round, though it doesn't reverse the progress or allow egress. Once the height of the cage's ceiling is 3 feet, Medium creatures take 10d10 points of bludgeoning damage each round the cage's ceiling is not successfully held up. Once the height of the cage's ceiling is 1 foot, Small creatures take 10d10 points of bludgeoning damage each round that the ceiling is not successfully held up. Tiny creatures can attempt a DC 30 Escape Artist check to flee through the holes in the cage, Diminutive creatures must succeed at a DC 20 Escape Artist check, and Fine creatures can leave automatically. These traps are often employed in conjunction with an effect that prevents dimensional travel, such as <em>dimensional lock</em>. This addition doesn't change the trap's CR, but it does make the trap a combination of mechanical and magical.</p>\n<h2>FACELESS STATUE TRAP CR 7</h2>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>magic; <strong>Perception </strong>DC 31; <strong>Disable Device </strong>DC 31</p>\n<p>EFFECTS</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger </strong>proximity (15 feet); <strong>Reset </strong>none</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>The faceless statue trap targets a creature with a <em>flesh to stone </em>effect (DC 19, single target), followed immediately by a <em>stone shape </em>effect, which completely smooths the face of the target, making it appear to be faceless. If the creature is returned to flesh, this transformation persists, rendering the target permanently blind, deaf, mute, and unable to breathe. Unless the change is reversed via <em>regenerate </em>or other magic capable of restoring the target's mouth or nose, or unless the target is able to survive without breathing, the creature begins to suffocate immediately. Using <em>stone shape </em>on the creature while it is still petrified can restore its face, preventing this, but only if the caster succeeds at a DC 25 Craft (sculpture) check.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, the spell creates a grotesque parody of a face, formed entirely of flesh and without function. Other variants of this trap exist that perform similarly grotesque alterations to a creature via <em>stone shape</em>.</p>\n<h2>SINKING COFFIN TRAP CR 7</h2>\n<p><strong>Type </strong>mechanical; <strong>Perception </strong>DC 20; <strong>Disable Device </strong>DC 25</p>\n<p>EFFECTS</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger </strong>location; <strong>Reset </strong>repair</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>This trap activates similarly to a pit trap, but the pit is actually a metal coffin concealed under the floor that drops into a body of water under the floor once a creature falls inside. The pitlike opening is 5 feet across, leading into a hollow metal coffin that's 10 feet deep. A creature that steps onto the opening and fails a DC 20 Reflex save falls in, taking 1d6 points of falling damage. The top of the metal box then automatically shuts and locks (Disable Device DC 30, accessible from either side), and the fastenings holding the box to the floor release, causing it and anyone still inside or standing on top of it to plummet into a body of water, typically either fast-flowing or at least 200 feet deep. The box sinks at a rate of 60 feet per round, and could be carried by the current. The box is airtight, and contains enough air for a single Medium creature to breathe for 10 minutes before being at risk of suffocation (<em>Core Rulebook </em>445). If the box is successfully opened while underwater, the water takes 1 round to fill it, during which time any creature inside the box must succeed at a DC 15 Strength check to escape the box against the power of the rushing water.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>NIGHTMARE DREAMSCAPES</h1>\n<p>The following section provides guidelines for creating nightmare dreamscapes: realms of fear and horror within the Dimension of Dreams. A nightmare typically has a goal, which the dreamer can complete within the nightmare dreamscape to win freedom from it, and features, which represent the ways in which the dreamer's fears manifest. A nightmare's goal and features might come entirely from the dreamer's own mind or be chosen by the creator of a supernatural effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Naturally Occurring Nightmares</h2>\n<p>Most commonly, nightmares come not from an outside source, but solely from the dreamer's mind. Whenever a creature sleeps, if it experienced any of the following events since the last time it slept, there is a 20% chance it has a naturally occurring nightmare: being reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, being frightened or panicked, being shaken for more than 1 minute, or taking 1 or more points of Wisdom damage or drain. If a campaign uses the sanity rules (see page 12), taking sanity damage also counts.</p>\n<p>A naturally occurring nightmare takes the form of a frightening dream (<em>Occult Adventures </em>241-243). As with other dreams, the nightmare dreamscape has the flowing time, highly morphic, and wild magic planar traits. The exact nature of a naturally occurring nightmare dreamscape is created from the dreamer's unconscious thoughts, and is not under its control. The GM can select the dreamscape's traits, or determine them randomly using the following tables. It is more difficult for the dreamer to attempt fantastic feats in nightmares, and the DC of Charisma checks to do so increases by 10.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><strong>d%</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"10\"><strong>Gravity</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">1-60</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Normal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">61-65</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Heavy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">66-70</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Light</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">71-80</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">None</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">81-90</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Objective directional</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">91-100</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Subjective directional</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />@Compendium[pf-content.pf-tables.sn75vN6wpmU4sSzV]{Naturally Occurring Nightmares: Gravity}(rollable)</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><strong>d%</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"10\"><strong>Size and Shape</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">1-30</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Infinite</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">31-60</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Finite shape</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">61-100</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Self-contained shape</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-tables.bBTTb1JbG7euO9rF]{Horror Adventures: Naturally Occurring Nightmares: Size and Shape}(rollable)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Supernatural Nightmares</h2>\n<p>A supernatural nightmare is similar to a naturally occurring nightmare, but is created deliberately by a malevolent entity. This entity chooses the gravity, size, and shape of the dreamscape, and can also determine the dreamscape's goal and features; the goal must be reasonably accomplished, subject to the GM's discretion. Some supernatural nightmares impose penalties if the goal of the nightmare is not completed, with the most dire cases allowing for death in the dreamscape to cause death in the waking world.</p>\n<p><strong>Spells</strong>: Certain spells, such as <em>nightmare </em>or <em>night terrors </em>(see page 123), can cause their targets to experience nightmares. A caster of the <em>nightmare </em>spell can choose to ensnare her target in a nightmare dreamscape instead of allowing her target a Will save to resist the spell. If so, the caster doesn't have much control over the nightmare dreamscape but can ensure the presence of one nightmare feature (see below) per 5 caster levels. The caster doesn't select which nightmare features the target experiences. If the target fails to accomplish the goal of the nightmare, it suffers the spell's effects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Goal of a Nightmare</h2>\n<p>Each nightmare dreamscape has a particular action that can be completed to allow the dreamer to escape the nightmare. This goal may or may not be immediately obvious. If the dreamer is unable to complete the goal in a reasonable period of time (as determined by the GM), the nightmare is considered to have bested the dreamer. The dreamer suffers no ill effects when defeated by a naturally occurring nightmare; however, there might be penalties if the dreamer fails to achieve a supernatural nightmare's goal. The GM can choose a goal or determine one randomly using the table below.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><strong>d%</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"10\"><strong>Nightmare Goal</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">1-35</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Reach a creature</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">36-80</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Reach a location</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">81-100</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Take a test</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-tables.FGoiCz9ifgRZCCBU]{Horror Adventures: Nightmare Goal}(rollable)</p>\n<p><strong>Reach a Creature</strong>: The nightmare ends once the dreamer reaches or catches a creature. The creature might actively flee, or could lead the dreamer on a specific path.</p>\n<p><strong>Reach a Location</strong>: The nightmare ends once the dreamer reaches a particular place.</p>\n<p><strong>Take a Test</strong>: The nightmare ends once the dreamer completes a test. The nature of the test varies: a cleric might have to endure a test of faith, while a fighter might have to perform difficult combat drills. The GM chooses three to five skill checks or ability checks to represent different aspects of the test, of which the character must succeed at a minimum of half, or devises a series of more complicated encounters, if she desires.</p>\n<h2>Nightmare Features</h2>\n<p>Each nightmare has one or more nightmare features, which complicate the nightmare in some fashion. For naturally occurring nightmares, roll twice on the table below or simply select which nightmare features to use.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><strong>d%</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"10\"><strong>Nightmare Features</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">1-20</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Being chased</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">21-30</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">False awakening</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">31-50</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Incompetent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">51-65</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">No gear</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">66-80</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Unable to move</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">81-95</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Unable to speak</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">96-100</td>\n<td colspan=\"10\">Other disadvantage, or roll again twice</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-tables.RIGr93REDsLdpG3K]{Horror Adventures: Nightmare Features}(rollable)</p>\n<p><strong>Being Chased</strong>: The dreamer is being stalked or chased by something. The thing should be difficult (or impossible) to defeat in combat, but possible to escape. Either employ the chase rules (<em>GameMastery Guide </em>232) or adjudicate the stalking creature's threat in some other way.</p>\n<p><strong>False Awakening</strong>: When the nightmare ends, the dreamer believes it is awake, but actually enters another nightmare dreamscape. Roll one nightmare feature fewer when determining the nature of this dreamscape.</p>\n<p><strong>Incompetent</strong>: The dreamer is suddenly unable to do something that it is normally good at. It might lose ranks in an important skill, have its base attack bonus reduced by half, or lose a key class feature or ability for the duration of the dream.</p>\n<p><strong>No Gear</strong>: The dreamer arrives in the dream naked, without any gear or equipment.</p>\n<p><strong>Unable to Move</strong>: The dreamer has difficulty traveling. The dreamer could literally be paralyzed, or it might find that no matter where it goes, it always winds up in the same spot. Either way, the inability to move shouldn't render the nightmare's goal impossible.</p>\n<p><strong>Unable to Speak</strong>: The dreamer either can't speak or can't understand anything said in the dream.</p>\n<p>^Horror Rules Running Horror Adventures</p>"}

Chapter 2: Archetypes And Class Options}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Some wizards plumb the despicable depths of the mystic arts or bend reality to thwart the designs of darkness.</p>\n<h1>Elder Mythos Scholar (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Elder Mythos scholars risk their sanity to seek knowledge of alien and awful entities from beyond the stars.</p>\n<p><strong>Arcane Bond</strong>: An Elder Mythos scholar must choose to bond with an object, inscribing that object with eldritch runes.</p>\n<p>This alters arcane bond.</p>\n<p><strong>Eldritch Knowledge (Su)</strong>: An Elder Mythos scholar gains two fewer daily uses of his 1st-level arcane school ability, which is normally used a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier. If he has no such ability, he can't take this archetype.</p>\n<p>When an Elder Mythos scholar attempts a Will save against confusion, fear, insanity, or madness (see page 12), whether magical or mundane, he can spend 2 daily uses of that arcane school ability to apply his Intelligence modifier instead of his Wisdom modifier to the save. However, whenever he uses this ability, he is affected by a <em>nightmare </em>the next time he sleeps, with no saving throw. Until he sleeps and experiences the nightmare, he can't recover the spent uses of the arcane school ability by any means.</p>\n<p>This ability alters the 1st-level arcane school ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Eldritch Grimoire</strong>: An Elder Mythos scholar keeps copious notes on how to use magic against the servants of the Elder Mythos in his spellbook. Every spell he adds to his spellbook takes up an additional 1d6 pages and costs twice the normal amount to inscribe; however, when casting spells prepared from his grimoire, he gains a +2 bonus on caster level checks and increases the save DCs by 1 against the creatures listed in talisman of revealing below.</p>\n<p>This ability alters spellbook.</p>\n<p><strong>Talisman of Revealing</strong>: While wearing or wielding his bonded item, an Elder Mythos scholar can spontaneously cast a special <em>detect aberration</em>(APG) spell by sacrificing a prepared 1st-level spell. Instead of detecting aberrations, this spell detects creatures associated with the Elder Mythos, such as the following (or similar creatures, at the GM's discretion): bhole(B4), colour out of space(B4), deep one(B5), deep one elder(B5), denizen of Leng(B2), elder thing(B4), flying polyp(B4), gug(B2), hound of Tindalos(B2), Leng ghoul(B5), Leng spider(B2), mi-go(B4), nightgaunt(B4), ratling(B4), shantak(B2), shoggoth, spawn of Yog-Sothoth(B4), star-spawn of Cthulhu(B4), voonith(B3), wendigo(B2), and yithian(B3). He gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Knowledge checks to identify such creatures and Spellcraft checks to identify effects they create.</p>\n<p>At 5th level, an Elder Mythos scholar adds <em>invisibility purge </em>and <em>see invisibility </em>to his spellbook and can spontaneously cast either spell by sacrificing a prepared spell of the same or higher level while wearing or wielding his bonded item. At 10th level, he adds <em>banish seeming</em>(APG) and <em>true seeing </em>to his spellbook as 5th-level spells and can spontaneously cast them in the same fashion.</p>\n<p>This replaces Scribe Scroll and the 5th- and 10th-level bonus feats.</p>\n<p><strong>Eldritch Infusion (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, once each day while preparing spells, an Elder Mythos scholar can spend 1 extra hour to brew a tincture of hallucinogens and alien trace minerals. Though it has no effect for others, if he drinks it, the elixir expands his mind and perceptions into transitive dimensions, granting him a +4 alchemical bonus to his Intelligence score and reducing his Wisdom and Constitution scores by 2 for 10 minutes per wizard level he has. While under the effects of this elixir, he adds 1/2 his class level to his Perception checks against aberrations and creatures listed in talisman of revealing, but subtracts the same amount from all other Perception checks. His spells have a 20% failure chance, unless they summon, call, or contact a creature listed in talisman of revealing or otherwise affect only such creatures (for instance, a <em>fireball </em>aimed at 3 gugs but not a <em>fireball </em>aimed at 3 gugs and a gnome).</p>\n<p>This ability replaces the school ability gained at 8th level.</p>\n<h1>Hallowed Necromancer (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Many wizards study necromancy to create undead, but some study the same arts to purge the stain of undeath.</p>\n<p><strong>Arcane School</strong>: A hallowed necromancer must specialize in the school of necromancy and swear never to create undead.</p>\n<p>This alters arcane school and spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Turn Undead (Su)</strong>: A hallowed necromancer must select Turn Undead as a bonus feat with her power over undead arcane school ability.</p>\n<p>This alters power over undead.</p>\n<p><strong>Positive Touch (Su)</strong>: As a standard action, a hallowed necromancer can sacrifice a prepared spell of the necromancy school to spontaneously cast a cure spell of the same level or lower, counting the spell as a necromancy spell rather than a conjuration spell. This cure spell harms only undead; it doesn't heal the living. If the spell requires an attack roll, it as has a critical threat range of 19-20.</p>\n<p>A number of times per day equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier, when she spontaneously casts a cure spell, she can either turn the effect into a ray and increase the range to close or remove the Will save but deal half the normal amount of damage.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces grave touch and Scribe Scroll.</p>\n<p><strong>Deathbane (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, a hallowed necromancer's cure spells are maximized when used to damage undead and the save DCs of her spells cast on undead creatures are 1 higher. She can expend 2 uses of positive touch as a swift action to imbue any weapon she wields with the <em>undead</em>-<em>bane </em>or <em>ghost touch </em>weapon special ability for 1 round per 5 wizard levels she has. These effects apply only against undead, and only while the hallowed necromancer wields the weapon. If the weapon is her arcane bond item, this ability costs only 1 use of positive touch.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 5th level.</p>\n<p><strong>Ghostbane (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a hallowed necromancer can expend 3 uses of her positive touch as a swift action while casting a spell to affect undead as if the spell were prepared with the Ectoplasmic Spell(APG), Thanatopic Spell(APG), or Threnodic Spell(APG) feat.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 10th level.</p>\n<p><strong>Guarded Life (Su)</strong>: At 15th level, when a hallowed necromancer fails a saving throw against a death effect, energy drain, a necromantic effect, or a negative energy effect, she can expend 2 uses of positive touch as an immediate action to reroll it. She must accept the result of the reroll even if it's worse. If she would take hit point damage from such an effect, as an immediate action she can instead expend 1 use of positive touch and sacrifice a prepared necromancy spell of 4th level or higher to reduce the damage she takes by an amount equal to her wizard level + 10 times the spell level.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces the 15th level bonus feat.</p>\n<h1>Undead Master (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Undead masters have great power over undeath.</p>\n<p><strong>Necromantic Focus</strong>: An undead master must be of an evil alignment. If he becomes nonevil, he can still use his powers but can't progress any further as a wizard. Most undead masters specialize in the necromancy school, and an undead master can't have necromancy as an opposition school.</p>\n<p>This alters arcane school and alignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Necropolitan (Ex)</strong>: An undead master gains a bonus equal to half his wizard level (minimum +1) on Diplomacy and Knowledge checks regarding undead creatures. Because of his obsessive focus on the undead, he takes a -2 penalty when attempting such checks regarding living creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Corpse Bond (Su)</strong>: An undead master can forge an arcane bond with an object, but that object must be made at least partially of bone. Alternatively, he can animate a corpse companion, as per the undead lord cleric archetype (<em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic </em>32). He can't gain a familiar.</p>\n<p>This ability alters arcane bond.</p>\n<p><strong>Command Undead (Su)</strong>: An undead master gains Command Undead as a bonus feat, treating his wizard level as his cleric level. If he lacks the ability to channel negative energy for the purpose of Command Undead, he can expend 3 uses of any 1st-level arcane school ability that normally has a number of uses per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier, rather than a use of channel energy. If he's a necromancer with the power over undead ability, he instead gains Improved Channel.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces Scribe Scroll.</p>\n<p><strong>Reanimator (Su)</strong>: An undead master adds the following spells to his spellbook at the given wizard levels: 1st-<em>repair undead</em>(ACG); 3rd-<em>lesser animate dead</em>(UM); 5th-<em>animate dead</em>; 7th-<em>undead anatomy I</em>(UM); 9th-<em>create undead</em>; 11th-<em>undeath to death</em>; 13th-<em>create greater undead</em>; 15th-<em>undead anatomy IV</em>(UM); 17th-<em>cursed earth</em>(UM). He can spontaneously cast any of these spells by sacrificing a prepared spell of the same level or higher. The undead master can cast <em>lesser animate dead</em>, <em>animate dead</em>, <em>create undead</em>, and <em>create greater undead </em>as if they were 1 level lower than their normal wizard spell level; this does not alter their level for the purpose of item crafting and the like.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces the bonus feats gained at 5th, 10th, and 15th levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Lich-Loved (Su)</strong>: At 20th level, an undead master gains the benefits of the undead sorcerer bloodline's one of us ability.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 20th level.</p>\n<p>^Archetypes and Class Options Feats</p>"}

Although these foul horrors might shy away from sunny fields and verdant forests, don't mistake their reluctance for weakness. They rule supreme in the realms of terror, and those who seek to put an end to such monsters must risk it all-body, mind, and soul.</p>\n<p><em>Pathfinder RPG Horror Adventures </em>includes a wide variety of rules and advice for players and GMs to amplify the horror in their games. Players will have to manage their sanity; avoid corruption; and select the right spells, feats, and gear if they hope to have any chance of survival. Meanwhile, GMs are presented with numerous new subsystems, expansions to diseases and madness, horrific environments, and sinister monster templates to challenge any hero. <em>Horror Adventures </em>includes plenty of ways to transform even the most innocent-seeming setting into a potential nightmare!</p>\n<h1>Navigation This Book</h1>\n<p>This book is organized by chapter, with each one containing rules grouped by type and theme for ease of reference. The following overview summarizes each chapter to give you an idea of what you'll find inside. Finally, if you're searching for a specific topic, refer to the index located on page 254.</p>\n<p><strong>Chapter 1-Horror Characters</strong>: Characters stand at the heart of any horror adventure. Whether forced into the darkness or venturing there willingly, these protagonists face danger beyond their imagining. This chapter helps players fully understand the risks their characters are taking by confronting the terrible forces of horror.</p>\n<p>The first section provides a more robust fear system. These additional rules help GMs build a sense of dread and make states of mind ranging from nervousness to mind-rending terror integral to the game. Following this are rules for sanity that present players with a way of gauging their characters' mental stability when confronting terrible truths and monstrous foes.</p>\n<p>Finally, this chapter contains a brand-new system of corruptions to tempt and torment characters. It includes 11 different corruptions that can pollute a character's very soul, each one progressing over time to offer enticing benefits and inflict accursed stains. These corruptions are followed by a section detailing alternate racial traits for characters who are born and raised while surrounded by horror.</p>\n<p><strong>Chapter 2-Archetypes and Class Options</strong>: When evil forces threaten civilization, characters need the proper tools to fight back. From the cult-hunting investigator who can sense the madness in others to the soul sentinel paladin who fights endlessly against the tide of corruption, there are plenty of character ideas here that will fit seamlessly into any horror adventure.</p>\n<p>In addition, many of the archetypes in this chapter make imposing villains who can strike fear and terror into the hearts of PCs, such as the sanity-draining mad scientist alchemist or the serial killer vigilante!</p>\n<p><strong>Chapter 3-Feats</strong>: This chapter features a variety of new feats useful to players and GMs who wish to craft horror-themed characters and creatures, including many new monster feats, such as Gruesome Shapechanger, which makes a shapechanger's transformation a sickening thing to behold. Also included are an expansion on story feats, first presented in <em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign </em>and feats that enhance spell-like abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Chapter 4-Spells and Rituals</strong>: Spells and magic are important elements of any horror game. They give villains the tools needed to perform vile rituals and grant heroes a chance to fight back or even undo past misdeeds. This chapter contains spells powered by the caster's sanity or by the sacrifice of another living being. The forces of good aren't without hope, however. This chapter also provides many spells that ward off evil and pronounce damnation on the souls of the wicked.</p>\n<p><strong>Chapter 5-Horror Rules</strong>: GMs armed with the proper tools are well on her way to creating memorable horror games. This chapter presents a selection of rules and subsystems that can enhance any game by giving it a suitably horrific focus. An expansion of the rules for curses gives these afflictions a bigger role and makes them even deadlier. In addition to new curses and cursed items, this section provides rules for cursed lands-places scarred by divine retribution or befouled by sinister forces. Also, diseases become significantly more dangerous, with effects that change over time and templates to turn existing poxes into terrifying plagues.</p>\n<p>This chapter next examines the environments typical to a horror setting-from spooky locations to deadly hazards. Fleshwarping is greatly expanded as well, giving GMs plenty of new ways to twist the bodies of heroes and villains alike. Haunts also make an appearance in this chapter, including new examples and haunts that are immune to divine power and must be dispelled using other means. Finally, this chapter looks at madness and how to integrate it into games, making this an invaluable section for GMs using the sanity system.</p>\n<p><strong>Chapter 6-Running Horror Adventures</strong>: While many games feature frightening elements, turning games into a tapestry of terror takes careful planning and consideration. This chapter gives GMs guidelines and suggestions on running horror games, from selecting the genre of horror to creating an adventure with the right pacing, and reveals how to sow tension in your players as much as their characters. Novice and veteran GMs alike will find a trove of tips in this chapter to help improve their horror games.</p>\n<p><strong>Chapter 7-Horror Gear and Magic Items</strong>: Gruesome torture implements and wicked magic items make up the bulk of this chapter. From the <em>murderer's machete </em>to the <em>needful doll</em>, there are plenty of foul items here to bedevil heroes. Fortunately, this chapter also includes protective talismans and other tools to help those fighting against evil.</p>\n<p>Finally, this section contains rules for possessed magic items-objects that become vessels for evil forces intent upon corrupting their wielders and those around them.</p>\n<p><strong>Chapter 8-Bestiary</strong>: What examination of horror would be complete without a look at monsters. This chapter presents a number of new templates and simple templates to alter any monster into a living terror. From implacable stalkers to simulacra made of living wax, these creatures will have characters quaking in fear!</p>\n<h1>Book References</h1>\n<p>This book refers to a number of other Pathfinder Roleplaying Game products, yet these additional supplements are not required to make use of this book.

Chapter 2: Archetypes and Class Options","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<p>@Compendium[pf-content.horror-adventures.jsEW1pMN3Ds5FXmw]{(Index) Horror Adventures}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.horror-adventures.qet8A89j9mn1czfm]{2.0. Chapter 2: Archetypes And Class Options}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Kineticists are suffused with power outside their control, and these chaotic elements can lead them to horrifying fates. Sometimes, the surging powers of the elements break a kineticist's mind, and other times, a kineticist chooses to end the lives of the innocent in order to protect herself from the consequences of her actions.</p>\n<h1>Dark Elementalist (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Some kineticists who are loathe to suffer the consequences of channeling their power study the darkest esoteric energies of the planes and use souls to fuel their occult might. The spiritual tortures these dark elementalists inflict upon their victims' souls are horrifically selfish acts on par with the actions of daemons.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Since harming souls is a wicked act, a dark elementalist must be of an evil alignment. If she becomes nonevil, she can't use any of her dark elementalist abilities other than dark studies, though she can still use her other kineticist class features.</p>\n<p><strong>Dark Studies</strong>: A dark elementalist's base Will save bonus from the kineticist class is equal to 2 + 1/2 her kineticist level, and her base Reflex and Fortitude save bonuses are equal to 1/3 her kineticist level. She gains all Knowledge skills as class skills.</p>\n<p>A dark elementalist uses her Intelligence modifier instead of her Constitution modifier to determine her damage with wild talents, the DCs of Constitution-based wild talents, the durations of wild talents with Constitution-based durations, her bonus on concentration checks for wild talents, and any other Constitution-based effects of all her wild talents.</p>\n<p>This alters the kineticist's class skills and base saving throws and the key ability score of wild talents.</p>\n<p><strong>Soul Power</strong>: A dark elementalist uses the souls of others to protect herself from the dangers of burn. She can't choose to accept burn if doing so would raise her total number of points of burn above 3. However, a number of times per day equal to her Intelligence modifier, as a full-round action she can gather up the soul of a sentient creature with a CR equal to or higher than her character level, as long as that creature died in the past minute. When she does, some of her existing burn is unloaded into the departing soul, racking it with unspeakable torment, but reducing her current burn total by 1 point. A soul used in this way cannot be brought back to life as if it died of a death effect. Using a soul like this doesn't heal the nonlethal damage from that point of burn immediately, but does enable the dark elementalist to heal the nonlethal damage from that point of burn normally.</p>\n<p>At 6th level, racking a soul in this way forces anyone trying to bring the creature back to life to succeed at a caster level check (DC = 10 + the dark elementalist's kineticist level) or the attempt fails. At 11th level, even if the creature returns from the dead, its soul is so damaged by the agony that it takes 2d6 points of Wisdom damage (or 3d10 points of sanity damage if using the sanity system found on page 12). At 16th level, the soul is destroyed in the process, and the creature can be restored only by a <em>miracle </em>or <em>wish</em>.</p>\n<p>A dark elementalist gains attack and damage bonuses from elemental overflow based on how many times that day she has used soul power to rack a soul, rather than based on her current burn total. For instance, a 9th-level dark elementalist who used soul power to rack three or more souls during the course of the day would add a +3 bonus on attack rolls and a +6 bonus on damage rolls. A dark elementalist does not gain size bonuses to physical ability scores or a chance to ignore critical hits and sneak attacks from elemental overflow.</p>\n<p>This ability alters burn and elemental overflow and replaces internal buffer.</p>\n<h1>Psychokineticist (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>While most kineticists channel elemental power through their bodies, rare kineticists, such as elemental ascetics, overwhelming souls, and psychokineticists channel such power through their minds. Psychokineticists lack an overwhelming soul's strong spirit, and so this energy ravages their minds but unleashes power locked in their ruptured emotions. Sometimes a psychokineticist inadvertently unleashes his power when he experiences an outburst of strong emotion, potentially making a psychokineticist an outcast or even an accidental killer.</p>\n<p><strong>Emotional Intensity (Ex)</strong>: A psychokineticist uses his Wisdom modifier instead of his Constitution modifier to determine his damage with wild talents, the DCs of Constitution-based wild talents, the durations of wild talents with Constitution-based durations, his bonus on concentration checks for wild talents, and other Constitution-based effects of all his wild talents.</p>\n<p>He can't use any of his wild talents whenever he would be unable to use a spell with an emotion component (see page 144 of <em>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures</em>), and if he ever gains immunity to charm, compulsion, emotion effects (even if such immunity extends only to a subcategory of these effects like fear effects or compulsion effects from creatures of certain alignments), he loses all his kineticist abilities. This includes effects that he previously activated that normally last until the next time his burn is removed, like elemental defenses, though he still keeps all his penalties from burn. He can always choose to ignore such immunities when he would normally gain them, even if they are granted by another class feature (such as the paladin's aura of courage), but once he decides whether or not to ignore an immunity he would have gained, the choice cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>A psychokineticist adds Sense Motive to his list of class skills and gains Psychic Sensitivity(OA) as a bonus feat.</p>\n<p>This ability alters the kineticist's class skills and the key ability score of wild talents.</p>\n<p><strong>Mind Burn (Ex)</strong>: A psychokineticist's mind strains when he overtaxes himself. He takes a -2 penalty on Will saves, Wisdom checks, and Wisdom-based skill checks for each point of burn he has accepted, rather than taking nonlethal damage from burn. He can accept an amount of burn equal to his Wisdom modifier (rather than 3 + his Wisdom modifier). Otherwise, his burn works just like a normal kineticist's.</p>\n<p>This ability alters burn.</p>\n<p><strong>Mental Overflow (Ex)</strong>: A psychokineticist's elemental energy sends strange elemental humors and planar echoes through his brain instead of reshaping his body with matter from his element. Instead of gaining size bonuses to physical ability scores from elemental overflow, he gains alchemical bonuses to his mental ability scores in equal amounts (a +2 alchemical bonus to two mental ability scores at 6th level if he has at least 3 points of burn;</p>\n<p>a +4 alchemical bonus to one mental ability score and a +2 alchemical bonus to the other two at 11th level if he has at least 5 points of burn; and a +6 alchemical bonus to one mental ability score, a +4 alchemical bonus to another, and a +2 alchemical bonus to the last at 16th level if he has at least 7 points of burn). A psychokineticist doesn't gain a chance to negate critical hits and sneak attacks based on his burn. Otherwise, his elemental overflow works just like a normal kineticist's.</p>\n<p>This ability alters elemental overflow.</p>\n<h1>UTILITY WILD TALENTS</h1>\n<p>When most people talk to the flames, others call them mad. The following utility wild talents allow the elements to speak back, after a fashion.</p>\n<h1>Elemental Whispers</h1>\n<p><strong>Element </strong>universal; <strong>Type </strong>utility (Su); <strong>Level </strong>1; <strong>Burn </strong>0</p>\n<p>You form a friendship with a fragment of your element. The element speaks back to you empathically, like a familiar. Pick a type of creature usually allowed as a familiar when you gain this wild talent. You gain the Alertness feat and the special abilities granted by a familiar of that type. As a standard action, you can give the voice of the element the body of such a creature, using elemental matter of the appropriate element within 30 feet. As long as you concentrate, the familiar can take actions as a normal animal of its type, and it can move any distance away from you, though if it takes any damage or you cease concentrating, it returns to your mind. You lose Alertness while the familiar is manifested in this way. The familiar gains abilities as usual for a familiar of its type, though it never gains the ability to speak with animals of its kind.</p>\n<h1>Elemental Whispers, Greater</h1>\n<p><strong>Element </strong>universal; <strong>Type </strong>utility (Su); <strong>Level </strong>3; <strong>Burn </strong>0</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite </strong>elemental whispers</p>\n<p>Your friendship with the elements has grown. You gain your choice of a wysp(B5) or Small elemental of your primary element as an improved familiar, without needing to meet any of the usual prerequisites for gaining such a familiar. Unlike with elemental whispers, this improved familiar acts in all ways like a familiar: it's always manifested, it has hit points equal to 1/2 your own, and so on. You no longer receive the familiar benefits from the original creature you selected. If your improved familiar dies, you can still contact its voice in your mind and gain the Alertness feat, but you can't cause it to manifest. If you pay the usual costs for replacing a familiar, you manifest a new form for your elemental friend.</p>\n<p>^Archetypes and Class Options Feats</p>"}

Chapter 2: Archetypes And Class Options}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Surrounded by horror on all sides, paladins can be one last shining beacon of hope in a dark world, even if that beacon is in danger of being extinguished forever. Some paladins sacrifice themselves to protect their allies. Others struggle to save the souls of those on the brink of giving into the darkness. And even in the bleakest times, battered paladins continue to cling to their hopeless struggle against evil out of sheer determination and an unshakable faith in what is right.</p>\n<h1>Martyr (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Every paladin's code instructs him to put the welfare of others before his own, but some paladins take this farther than most, shouldering the blackest suffering of the world onto themselves in order to help others and inspiring their allies to achieve heights of valor rather than seeking the glory for themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Stigmata</strong>: As a standard action, the martyr can chant hymns of faith and cause bleeding stigmata to visibly appear on his body; at 7th level, he can manifest stigmata as a move action, and at 13th level, he can do so as a swift action. He can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Charisma modifier at 1st level, plus 1 additional round per day for each level beyond 1st. While his stigmata are active, he takes 1 point of bleed damage, which automatically ceases when he ends this ability but otherwise does not relent, even in the face of magical healing or Heal checks.</p>\n<p>His stigmata assist his allies, duplicating the effect of the countersong, distraction, or inspire courage bardic performance of a bard of his paladin level, though both countersong and distraction use Heal skill checks instead of Perform skill checks. At 10th level, he can choose to duplicate the effects of inspire greatness. At 16th level, he can choose to duplicate the effects of inspire heroics.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces smite evil.</p>\n<p><strong>See No Evil, Hear No Evil (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, the martyr and all allies within 20 feet of him gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against bardic performance, sonic effects, language-dependent effects, and gaze attacks. This ability functions only when the martyr is conscious.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces divine grace.</p>\n<p><strong>Aura Mastery (Su)</strong>: The martyr's aura of courage, aura of resolve, and aura of righteousness have a radius of 20 feet instead of 10 feet, but the martyr does not gain immunity to fear, charms, or compulsions from those abilities.</p>\n<p>This ability alters aura of courage, aura of resolve, and aura of righteousness.</p>\n<p><strong>Aura of Health (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, the martyr and all allies within 20 feet of him gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against diseases. This ability functions only when the martyr is conscious.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces divine health.</p>\n<p><strong>Martyr's Mercy (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a martyr can apply any of the mercies for which he qualifies based on his paladin level to his lay on hands, even if he didn't select that mercy (or its prerequisites). However, when he uses a mercy he didn't select, he transfers the condition to himself for the remaining duration (ignoring any immunity he might have to the condition), and he can't use this ability if he already has that condition. If he transfers a condition to himself in this way, he can't remove it from himself with a personal-only ability. The martyr can use lay on hands on any ally within 30 feet, rather than needing to touch the ally, but using lay on hands on himself is a standard action, not a swift action.</p>\n<p>This ability alters lay on hands and mercy.</p>\n<h1>Soul Sentinel (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>In a world of horrors, some holy warriors fight to safeguard the minds and spirits of those exposed to evil. Soul sentinels use the strength of their resolve to stem the tide of corruption and insanity, as they believe that the greatest tragedy is a soul lost to evil when it was within their power to save it.</p>\n<p><strong>Reprieve (Su)</strong>: A soul sentinel relieves manic and tortured souls exposed to the harsh evil of the world. At 6th level, when the soul sentinel uses her lay on hands ability to heal a living creature, she can remove <em>confusion </em>effects in place of applying one of her other mercies. If used on a creature suffering from a permanent confusion effect, this removes the effect for only 1 minute.</p>\n<p>This replaces the mercy gained at 6th level.</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Soul (Su)</strong>: At 11th level, a sacred soul is immune to hexes and curse spells or abilities. Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against hexes or curses. This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces aura of justice.</p>\n<p><strong>Greater Reprieve (Su)</strong>: The soul sentinel suppresses the stain of corruption on the spirits of those she heals. At 12th level, whenever she uses her lay on hands ability to heal a living creature (other than herself ) or damage an undead creature, in place of applying one of her other mercies, she can suppress the stain from a corrupted creature's most recent manifestation for 1 minute (for more information about corruption and manifestations, see page 14). Any gift from that manifestation is unaffected and remains available, unless the manifestation has a special note requiring the gift and stain be taken together, in which case greater reprieve also suppresses the gift.</p>\n<p>This replaces the mercy gained at 12th level.</p>\n<h1>Tortured Crusader (ARCHETYPE)</h1>\n<p>Though tortured crusaders may be beaten and battered, body, mind, and soul, they still somehow continue through torment and hardship. Despite setbacks and impossible odds, they shine like candles even in the darkest times. Somewhere in their minds, they realize that they can't win in the end, but this only strengthens their resolve to fight for what is right, rather than giving in to hopelessness.</p>\n<p><strong>Torment</strong>: A tortured crusader's great suffering in the face of inevitable horror strengthens her faith and resolve, even as it makes her introverted and far less personable than most paladins. A tortured crusader uses Wisdom instead of Charisma as her key spellcasting ability score (to determine her spell DCs, bonus spells per day, bonus on concentration checks, and so on), and to determine the effects of lay on hands.</p>\n<p>This ability alters the paladin's spellcasting, smite evil, and lay on hands.</p>\n<p><strong>Self-Sufficient</strong>: A tortured crusader adds Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (dungeoneering), Knowledge (planes), Perception, Stealth, Survival, and Use Magic Device to her list of class skills, instead of Diplomacy and Handle Animal. She gains a number of skill ranks equal to 4 + her Intelligence modifier at each level, instead of gaining a number of skill ranks equal to 2 + her Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>This ability alters the paladin's class skills and skill ranks per level.</p>\n<p><strong>All Is Darkness</strong>: Everything around a tortured crusader is so bleak that detecting evil only reminds her that the odds are always against her. A tortured crusader doesn't gain the detect evil or divine grace class features. At 1st level, a tortured crusader gains the smite evil ability, but she doesn't add her Charisma bonus to attack rolls or a deflection bonus equal to her Charisma bonus to her AC against the target of her smite. At 2nd level, she adds a +4 bonus to attack rolls and a +4 deflection bonus to AC against the target of her smite.</p>\n<p>This ability replaces detect evil and divine grace and alters smite evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Alone in the Dark</strong>: Faced with endless foes, a tortured crusader can't ask others to confront the same horrors she does. She can't use her lay on hands ability to heal others or to channel energy, though starting at 4th level, she can convert two uses of lay on hands into an additional use of smite evil. Her aura of courage, aura of resolve, aura of faith, and aura of righteousness affect only her, not her allies. When she selects a divine bond, it must be with a weapon, not a mount.</p>\n<p>This ability alters lay on hands, channel energy, divine bond, aura of courage, aura of resolve, aura of faith, and aura of righteousness.</p>\n<p><strong>Second Chance (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, once per day, a tortured crusader can spend two uses of lay on hands and choose an unambiguous trigger such as \"when I am paralyzed\" or \"when I am about to fall unconscious from hit point damage,\" as well as a mercy she knows starting at 3rd level. When the named trigger occurs, the tortured crusader gains the benefits of a lay on hands with the chosen mercy without spending an action. This healing can prevent her from falling unconscious or dying. If the effect doesn't trigger, it expires the next time the tortured crusader recovers uses of lay on hands.</p>\n<p>This ability alters lay on hands and mercy.</p>\n<p><strong>Last Stand (Su)</strong>: At 11th level, a tortured crusader can spend an additional use of smite evil when declaring a smite to make it a last stand. The duration of last stand's benefits is only 1 minute (rather than 24 hours). However, the bonus damage from smite evil is doubled on every attack (this doesn't stack with the doubling if the smite's target is an evil outsider, undead, or evil dragon).</p>\n<p>This ability replaces aura of justice.</p>\n<p>^Archetypes and Class Options Feats</p>"}

Chapter 7: Horror Gear And Magic Items}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Unlike normal magic items, artifacts are not easily destroyed and are impossible for PCs to create. Instead of construction information, each artifact includes one possible means by which it might be destroyed.</p>\n<p>Artifacts should never be purchased or found as part of a random treasure hoard. When placing an artifact in your game, be sure to consider its impact, but also keep in mind that artifacts are fickle objects; if they become too much of a nuisance, they can easily become lost once more.</p>\n<h1>Minor Artifacts</h1>\n<p>The artifacts presented here are all minor artifacts. Minor artifacts are not necessarily unique items, but are magic items that can no longer be created by common mortal means.</p>\n<h1>CUP OF FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE</h1>\n<p><strong>SLOT</strong> none <strong>CL</strong> 20th <strong>WEIGHT</strong> 2 lbs.</p>\n<p><strong>AURA</strong> strong divination.</p>\n<p>This ivory goblet is decorated with carvings of impossibly tall towers rising above modest abodes. The goblet is always filled to the brim with wine. Any drops spilling from the cup vanish into nothingness before they touch the ground.</p>\n<p>Once per day, the cup grants a permanent +1d4 insight bonus on all Knowledge checks to a creature that drinks from it, but it permanently reduces the drinker's Wisdom score by the same amount. If your campaign uses the sanity rules (see page 12), this instead reduces the drinker's sanity score by double the amount. The bonus on Knowledge checks and reduction to Wisdom stack with multiple drinks from the same cup, but the bonus can never exceed +10. If the insight bonus ever becomes greater than the drinker's Intelligence modifier or reaches +10, she must succeed at a Will save with a DC equal to 20 + the amount by which the insight bonus exceeds her Intelligence modifier (or DC 20 if the bonus reaches +10 but she has an Intelligence modifier of +10 or greater). If the user fails, she becomes insane (as per <em>insanity</em>). Even if the user succeeds, the inescapable feeling of knowing too much continues to vex her, and she must repeat the saving throw once per day. Only spells that can remove <em>insanity </em>can put her mind at ease. However, curing the effect (or the insanity that it causes) permanently removes the insight bonus and Wisdom reduction and makes the user unable to ever again be affected by a <em>cup of forbidden knowledge</em>.</p>\n<h1>DESTRUCTION</h1>\n<p>A creature with an Intelligence score of 7 or lower can destroy a <em>cup of forbidden knowledge </em>by beating it savagely with physical attacks that deal a total of 100 points of damage or more within 1 round. The creature must not know that the item is the <em>cup of forbidden knowledge</em>, nor can it be commanded, influenced, or tricked into destroying the cup by another creature that knows of the cup and its destruction condition.</p>\n<h1>DARK GRIMOIRE</h1>\n<p><strong>SLOT</strong> none <strong>CL</strong> 20th <strong>WEIGHT</strong> 6 lbs.</p>\n<p><strong>AURA</strong> strong (all schools)This heavy grimoire is bound in leather and has wicked-looking metal clasps. The <em>dark grimoire </em>is a substantial text, nearly 1,000 pages long. Its pages contain some good spells and some evil spells, though most aren't tied to any alignment. It also contains an account of many of the beings of the Elder Mythos and spells intended for summoning them.</p>\n<p>The very act of reading the text is dangerous. Every hour a reader studies the book, there is a 2% chance that the reader encounters something too much for mortal minds to absorb and goes insane (as per <em>insanity</em>). A successful DC 25 Will save negates the insanity, but each time a creature succeeds at this save, the DC of the next Will save against insanity from the <em>dark grimoire </em>increases by 5, and these increases stack. Unlike normal for the <em>insanity </em>spell, only a <em>wish </em>or <em>miracle </em>can reverse the insanity inflicted by the <em>dark grimoire</em>.</p>\n<p>Using the <em>dark grimoire </em>to cast spells requires no spellcasting ability-merely time. Casting any spell requires studying the book for a number of hours equal to the spell's level (or 30 minutes for a 0-level spell). Any spell that normally involves a costly material component instead requires sacrificing humanoid creatures. Any spell that normally requires a costly focus instead requires a focus built from the remains of sacrificed humanoid creatures. In both cases, 1 Hit Die worth of sacrifices are required for each 25 gp that the component or focus normally costs.</p>\n<p>Summoning an entity of the Elder Mythos requires studying the book for a number of hours equal to double the creature's CR and making a number of humanoid sacrifices equal to double the creature's Hit Dice. If an attempt to summon a Great Old One is made in this manner, there is only a 25% chance that it appears. If the Great Old One appears, there is an equal chance that it attacks, ignores, or communicates with the creature that summoned it.</p>\n<h1>DESTRUCTION</h1>\n<p>The <em>dark grimoire </em>can be destroyed by burning it. However, many copies exist, and destroying the artifact merely transfers its powers to a random copy of the book. Destroying the <em>dark grimoire </em>permanently thus requires finding and destroying all copies in existence.</p>\n<h1>ELDER SIGN</h1>\n<p><strong>SLOT</strong> none <strong>CL</strong> 20th <strong>WEIGHT</strong> 10 lbs.</p>\n<p><strong>AURA</strong> strong abjuration</p>\n<p>This stone tablet bears a carving in the shape of a twig with five branches. There are only a limited number of <em>Elder Signs </em>in existence, so each time one of these artifacts is destroyed, the universe loses one of the few things that can reliably keep cosmic horrors at bay-and inevitable doom draws closer.</p>\n<p>A creature holding an <em>Elder Sign </em>can cast <em>banishment</em>, <em>forbiddance</em>, and <em>greater dispel magic </em>at will by reciting occult mantras, though all three effects work only against creatures and magic related to the Elder Mythos, including any of the following creatures (and other cosmic horror-related creatures, at the GM's discretion): bhole(B4), colour out of space(B4), deep one(B5), deep one elder(B5), denizen of Leng(B2), elder thing(B4), flying polyp(B4), gug(B2), hound of Tindalos(B2), Leng ghoul(B5), Leng spider(B2), mi-go(B4), nightgaunt(B4), ratling(B4), shantak(B2), shoggoth, spawn of Yog-Sothoth(B4), star-spawn of Cthulhu(B4), voonith(B3), wendigo(B2), and yithian(B3). Casting <em>forbiddance </em>this way doesn't require a costly material component, but if the same <em>Elder Sign </em>is used to cast <em>forbiddance </em>again, the artifact's connection to a previous location warded by the spell is severed, ending the first spell's effects immediately. Casting <em>banishment </em>on one of the listed creatures works even if the creature isn't extraplanar; in that case, it sends the creature to the place on the Material Plane from which it originated.</p>\n<p>An <em>Elder Sign </em>can also banish a Great Old One (no save), but doing so causes the artifact to be consumed in a bright flame.</p>\n<h1>DESTRUCTION</h1>\n<p><em>Elder Signs </em>are immune to damage, and the only certain way to destroy one of these artifacts is to banish a Great Old One with it.</p>\n<p>^Horror Gear and Magic Items Bestiary</p>"}

Chapter 7: Horror Gear and Magic Items","color":"#000000"}},"content":"<p>@Compendium[pf-content.horror-adventures.jsEW1pMN3Ds5FXmw]{(Index) Horror Adventures}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.horror-adventures.YdFkG9XZNNjugfNV]{7.0. Chapter 7: Horror Gear And Magic Items}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The possession of people, places, and objects by spirits- usually malevolent-is a common trope throughout folklore, mythology, and contemporary storytelling. The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game already has means for creatures to possess other creatures and objects, but the existing <em>object possession </em>spells (<em>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures </em>179) don't allow the caster to use spells and spell-like abilities through the object or give the possessor access the object's special properties. This section offers a way for a creature to transfer its spirit into a magic item through existing spells, turning the object into something akin to an intelligent item.</p>\n<p>A possessed magic item is an excellent source of horror and tension in a campaign. An identified non-intelligent magic item becomes a known quantity to its wielder, who comes to rely on it functioning in a consistent manner. A well-used and trusty magic item that suddenly acts peculiarly, seemingly with a will of its own, is a threat PCs rarely see coming.</p>\n<p>These optional rules work best with the new <em>possession </em>and <em>object possession </em>spells introduced in <em>Occult Adventures</em>. You can also assume that all creatures with access to a <em>magic jar </em>spell-like ability can use it to possess magic items, similar to what is recommended on page 181 of <em>Occult Adventures</em>.</p>\n<h1>POSSESSING A MAGIC ITEM</h1>\n<p>Very few creatures have the ability to possess other creatures, and even fewer can possess objects. Yet it is thematically appropriate for a ghost or shadow demon, for example, to be able to possess a magic item. Rather than requiring another spell, feat, or ability, the rules that follow allow a creature with possession spells or spell-like abilities to fully place its mind within an object. A creature with a <em>possession</em>, <em>greater possession</em>, or <em>magic jar </em>spell-like ability can do this, as well as one with an <em>object possession </em>or <em>greater object possession </em>spell-like ability (at the GM's discretion). If the GM wishes, this can be expanded beyond spell-like abilities, allowing spellcasters to possess magic items when casting the listed spells. When a creature or spellcaster possesses an item, use the effects below, rather than the effects listed in the spell description. Outsiders and incorporeal undead are more likely to have the ability to inhabit objects than other creatures.</p>\n<p>Attended and unattended magic items receive saving throws as normal. An unattended magic item has a saving throw bonus equal to 2 + 1/2 the item's caster level. An attended item uses the owner's saving throw modifier or the unattended save modifier, whichever is higher. Since the item is the one attempting the saving throw, the owner doesn't get a sense of having succeeded at a saving throw, even if the saving throw is successful. The rules described in the <em>possession </em>and <em>greater possession </em>spells in regard to the possessor returning to its own body or the death of the possessor's corporeal form remain unchanged. The destruction of the possessed magic item is treated as if the host creature died.</p>\n<p><strong>Detection</strong>: The normal properties of a possessed magic item can be identified using the standard method, but detecting that an item is possessed is less straightforward. The Spellcraft skill combined with <em>detect magic </em>yields no evidence of possession whatsoever, although the item does have the appropriate necromancy aura if the possession came from a spell or spell-like ability. <em>Analyze aura </em>(<em>Occult Adventures </em>156), <em>thoughtsense </em>(<em>Occult Adventures </em>190), and spells that detect alignments work normally unless the possessor has an ability such as <em>nondetection </em>or <em>misdirection</em>. <em>Analyze dweomer </em>reveals the possession if the possessor fails its Will save.</p>\n<p><strong>Intelligent Items</strong>: Intelligent magic items normally can't be possessed, unless the GM states otherwise. In the rare event that a creature successfully possesses an intelligent item, the possessing creature must attempt Will saves against the intelligent item's Ego score to maintain control, similarly to an intelligent item's owner. Even on a success, the possessing creature doesn't gain access to the intelligent item's spell-like abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Protection from Evil</strong>: An attended magic item that belongs to a creature warded by <em>protection from evil </em>and similar effects is immune to any new attempt at possession while it remains attended. However, magic items don't receive a second saving throw if they are already possessed, nor is their possession in any way suppressed if they enter the area of effect of such a spell. They lack any sentience and self-determination to resist control once it has been established.</p>\n<h1>POSSESSED ITEM ABILITIES</h1>\n<p>The possessor retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. Most possessed magic items can't move or have very strictly defined movement and attack options. The possessor can use its own spells and spell-like abilities. Appropriate spell components and foci are still required for spells that call for them, which prevents the use of many spells, but not of most spell-like abilities. The possessor can use other abilities as long as they are completely mental or verbal in nature. The possessor takes its turn at approximately the same time as the item's owner. Each turn, the possessor can choose to take a standard action before or after the item's wielder, and it can take a swift action whenever it wants during the owner's turn (or an immediate action at any time). The possessor doesn't receive a move action unless the item has some means of locomotion, and can't take other actions that would allow it to move (with the exception of magic like <em>telekinesis</em>). The possessor can take full-round actions. Possessors can't use any of their own gear while possessing an object.</p>\n<p><strong>Communication</strong>: The possessor of a magic item can speak aloud and use its normal sight- and hearing-related senses (including blindsense and similar abilities) in a 60-foot radius of the item, provided the item isn't sheathed or put inside a container. This includes the ability to read, use abilities such as a <em>read magic </em>spell-like ability, or cast a spell from a scroll if the spell is on the possessor's spell list (provided it is possessing the scroll or the possessed object's owner is holding the scroll). The possessor can communicate telepathically while possessing a magic item if it could do so normally.</p>\n<p><strong>Control Owner</strong>: The possessor can also try to control the item's owner, although its capacity to do so is weaker than that of an intelligent item. The effect is similar to <em>dominate monster </em>but with a duration of 1 minute. The owner can negate this effect by succeeding at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the possessor's HD + the possessor's highest mental ability score modifier). Many possessing creatures use this ability only as a last resort, for it reveals their presence to the item's owner. After trying to control the item's owner, a possessing creature can't try to do so again for 1 hour, regardless of success or failure.</p>\n<p><strong>Item Abilities</strong>: Finally, the possessor can activate, deactivate, and otherwise manipulate the abilities of the magic item it inhabits, using a full round, standard, swift, or immediate action to do so as the magic item requires. The possessor has an intuitive knowledge of how the host object works. The possessor can also prevent the item's owner from activating an item's ability by spending the appropriate type of action before the owner does so. The owner receives no special insight into how or why the item malfunctions, other than the fact it doesn't do as she expects.</p>\n<p><strong>Touch Attacks</strong>: If the possessed item is a weapon, a successful melee or ranged attack by the wielder qualifies as a touch attack for the purposes of the possessor's special abilities. Likewise, the possessor of an attended possessed magic item automatically succeeds at any touch attack upon the item's owner unless the item is in a container.</p>\n<h1>CURSED ITEMS</h1>\n<p>It is possible for a creature to possess a non-intelligent cursed magic item. Doing so causes no harm to the possessor. At the GM's discretion, the possessor can try to influence the cursed object to perform as a non-cursed version. The possessor must succeed at a caster level check as if attempting to remove the curse, using the caster level of its possession effect (or its HD if it has no caster level). If successful, the possessor can force the cursed object to behave as the non-cursed version of the magic item for 24 hours. It can allow the object to behave like a cursed item again as a free action.</p>\n<p>^Horror Gear and Magic Items Bestiary</p>"}

Creating and employing new rules without any preparation is another one entirely. In the context of a horror adventure, such rules improvisation is not only useful, but all the more critical, as interruptions and page flipping can ruin a scene's atmosphere, while a quick improvised decision can keep the tension intact.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, as a benefit of being a well-developed game system, the Pathfinder RPG offers guidelines and subsystems for adjudicating hundreds of hazards and encounter types. Still, the game rules can't account for everything. In such cases, it's up to the GM to use her knowledge of the rules to improvise options. Coming up with quick, simple ways to support characters who find themselves in unique situations or who want to attempt audacious actions is usually preferable to avoiding such game-defining events. Depending on the case, a GM might ask players to merely roll an ability or skill check, setting a DC that seems appropriate. Another option-which can often be more fun-involves considering the situation and adapting existing rules to work for the game's needs.</p>\n<p>The remainder of this chapter presents a variety of situations that might appear in a horror adventure, but for which concrete rules don't exist. Each of the following sections references existing Pathfinder RPG rules (largely from the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook </em>and <em>Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide</em>) that GMs could retrofit to handle the encounter. These aren't definitive rules for any of the situations described below. Instead, they are a primer on customizing rules to meet specific needs, and they should help GMs look beyond the overt purpose of certain rules systems and identify precedents and components that might be repurposed in unlimited ways.</p>\n<h1>BURIED ALIVE</h1>\n<p>A character wakes up in a claustrophobic space, walls barely a hand's breadth above his face and to either side.</p>\n<p>The air is already growing sour, and his increasing heart rate and frantic breathing aren't helping the situation. There's only one thing to do: he has to escape.</p>\n<p><strong>By the Rules</strong>: In a coffin, a character's ability to move is restricted by the tight confines. Even if he's able to move, the coffin itself and the earth beyond present nearly insurmountable barriers to escape. Relevant to these challenges are the Escape Artist skill (<em>Core Rulebook </em>95), rules on hardness (<em>Core Rulebook </em>175), and details on cave-ins and collapses (<em>Core Rulebook </em>415), as well as the bury alive ability of the gravebound(B5), which uses the aforementioned systems to determine the ability's effects, including the amount of time it takes to dig up a buried character, with or without a shovel.</p>\n<p><strong>Extrapolation</strong>: The Escape Artist skill allows a character to move through a tight space by spending 1 minute and succeeding at a DC 30 Escape Artist check. This seems similar to the difficulty of moving within a coffin. As such, the GM might rule that for any action requiring motion to be successful-such as producing an item, making an attack, casting a spell, and so on-the character must spend 1 minute and succeed at this check.</p>\n<p>As for the coffin itself, a normal casket is probably of similar quality to a good wooden door or treasure chest, which would mean it has a hardness of 5 and 15 hit points. As soon as the coffin is broken, though, things get worse for the character who was buried alive. According to the rules on cave-ins and collapses, characters take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while buried. If such a character falls unconscious, he must succeed at a DC 15 Constitution check each minute. If he fails this check, he takes 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute until freed or dead. Thus, a GM might rule that a character can attempt a DC 20 Strength check every minute. If the character succeeds, he manages to clear enough dirt to drag himself upward 1 foot. At that rate, then, it would require six successful Strength checks for a character to dig himself free from a coffin buried 6 feet underground. This, of course, assumes that loose dirt covers the coffin. Other substances, like rocks or metal slabs, would make such a dig far more difficult, at the least, if not outright impossible.</p>\n<p><strong>Horror Considerations</strong>: The experience of being buried alive can be all the worse if a character isn't alone. Tiny or smaller creatures would not have their movement restricted in a coffin constructed for a Medium creature. Crawling hands(B4), rot grubs(B3), scarlet spiders(B4), and vipers all make particularly horrible coffinmates, particularly if they're crawling all over the character in swarms. Additionally, breaking out of a coffin and finding himself underwater, buried in a walled-off enclosure, or at the bottom of a tank of flesh-eating beetles might make a character quickly regret his escape.</p>\n<h1>BURNED AT THE STAKE</h1>\n<p>Public burning tops the list of preferred ways to dispose of witches, heretics, and undesirables of all sorts.</p>\n<p><strong>By the Rules</strong>: This is a simple matter of reskinning an existing rules set: being burned at the stake rather than being trapped in a forest fire (<em>Core Rulebook </em>426). With rules for heat damage, catching fire, and-most realistically- smoke inhalation, the forest fire rules can be combined with the grapple rules for tying someone up (<em>Core Rulebook </em>200) to provide everything necessary for binding a character to a stake and lighting the roaring flames.</p>\n<p><strong>Extrapolation</strong>: Binding a character to a stake-and setting a DC to escape said bindings-can be covered by the tie-up options detailed in the grapple combat maneuver. Once the character is bound, likely amid heaps of unlit kindling, the process of starting the fire is relatively simple. Given dry conditions and a ready flame, a GM might rule that it takes 1 minute to get the fire burning to a point that smoke inhalation becomes a threat to a bound victim. After some initial encouragement, the fire takes over; after 1 minute, the victim begins taking 1d6 points of fire damage every round while facing additional Fortitude saving throws as detailed in the heat damage portion of the forest fire rules. Finally, 1 minute later and every minute after that, the victim must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex saving throw or catch fire, as per the catching fire rules on page 426 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>. Characters still bound to the stake take a -4 penalty on this saving throw.</p>\n<p><strong>Horror Considerations</strong>: Don't trust a burning wooden post in an open square to hold every heretic. Cages and magical paralysis are more effective at restraining victims, while illusions can lure unfortunates into traps. Placing the stake at the top of a spire or the bottom of a pit also makes access and escape more challenging and could extend the threat of smoke hazards.</p>\n<h1>BURNING BUILDINGS AND CRUMBLING STRUCTURES</h1>\n<p>The fire in the tavern has gotten out of control, the ancient fortress is falling apart, the villain's death causes his dark castle to collapse into the darkness below, or the powers holding together the alien sanctum have failed and are tearing the place apart. Is there any hope of escape, or will the PCs find themselves just another group of casualties in this catastrophe?</p>\n<p><strong>By the Rules</strong>: Few of the game's ordinary rules operate on the same timer as a self-destructing structure, least of all the abstractions of combat rounds and character actions. Characters counting squares to move out of a dungeon as swiftly as possible hardly captures the adrenaline of panicked flight, rather resembling a chess endgame. But the rules for chases (<em>GameMastery Guide </em>232) work more like a race against the clock and thus fit the situation far better than combat rounds would.</p>\n<p><strong>Extrapolation</strong>: In this case, a chase isn't that different from an escape from a structure that's collapsing around the characters; all it requires is a few tweaks to represent the differing circumstances. The GM can simply do away with the \"fleeing character\" entirely (unless the PCs are also chasing another character out of the collapsing structure) and instead set out a slate of obstacle the PCs must overcome to get out of the structure in time.</p>\n<p>These might include dodging falling timbers, leaping across gaps in the floor, noticing paths that circumvent dangers, squeezing through narrow gaps in the rubble, fighting off the effects of smoke inhalation, and so on. Some challenges might allow characters to charge through walls of flame, weakened barriers, or splintering banisters, causing them to take hit point damage in exchange for successes. Typically these barriers deal an appropriate amount of damage to add to the sense of urgency for characters of the PCs' level without making the barriers themselves harmful enough to kill the PCs-unless they press their luck on these damaging barriers one too many times. In total, the GM should establish a number of challenges just like she would for a normal chase, but replace the threat of a fleeing character \"getting away\" with the threat of the PCs failing to escape the crumbling structure before it's too late.</p>\n<p>This does mean that all the PCs will have to navigate the escape all the way to its end, or die trying. This means that it's more important than usual to consider each of the pairings in the chase and make sure to include at least one option in each pairing that the characters will be able to attempt. For example, pairing a DC 15 Knowledge (engineering) check with a high DC Escape Artist check might mean that the paladin can't possibly pass that chase square; for a normal chase, this would put the paladin out of the action for a little while, but in this modified chase, it means the paladin might be guaranteed to die.</p>\n<p>GMs should consider whether or not players can aid one another during an escape. If they're allowed to do so, perhaps any character near an adjacent obstacle can use the aid another action to assist another character. Additionally, the GM might want to have monsters or other enemies factor into the escape, giving the PCs the choice of standing their ground and fighting-while the timer continues to count down-or to continue fleeing, now with some foe nipping at their heels.</p>\n<p>How long characters have to escape the structure is up to the GM. This should be a number of turns that exceeds the number of challenges by 2 or 3 (or even fewer in particularly harrowing situations). Once that time expires, the GM determines the consequences-which should be ones decided on before the escape begins, even though the GM won't reveal her decision to the players until afterward, the better to build tension. Consider the following three options.</p>\n<p><em>No Threat</em>: Perhaps the whole escape might simply be for show-dramatics that heighten tension but pose no actual lethal threat (not that the PCs should be allowed to know that). Immediately after the last PC escapes, the structure collapses, implying that the characters escaped at the last possible moment.</p>\n<p><em>Heightened Danger</em>: Once the time limit expires, the situation in the structure becomes increasingly dangerous. Perhaps anyone still in the structure now takes damage every round. This might begin as 1d6 points of fire damage (or whatever is appropriate), but every 2 or 3 rounds the amount of damage doubles, suggesting a worsening situation. Or in the case of an alien sanctum falling apart into an unknowable void, perhaps strange and dangerous creatures crawl their way out of the nothingness with increasing frequency. Either way, this makes lagging behind dangerous, but not immediately fatal.</p>\n<p><em>Near-Fatal Conclusion</em>: The GM might rule that, once the timer expires, the structure collapses-a fate that probably means death for anyone trapped inside. See the Cave-Ins and Collapses rules on page 415 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>. The GM might add the threat of additional damage to those trapped within (or who try to rescue those left behind) if the conditions call for it-like dealing additional fire damage to those caught beneath a collapsed burning ruin.</p>\n<p><strong>Horror Considerations</strong>: Write a 10 on a whiteboard or set a die at 10 in front of the PCs. After their first turn trying to escape, change the number to 9. Decrease the number every turn. A generous GM might let them know that when the count reaches 0, the structure collapses (to whatever terrible end; consider the rules for cave-ins and collapses) or not. In either case, few things motivate a group like a ticking clock. Beyond collapsing structures, PCs may need to flee a burning topiary garden, a tsunami-battered village, the nightmare of a waking dreamer, a city being destroyed by kaiju (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 </em>165), or a forest come to life.</p>\n<h1>GUILLOTINE</h1>\n<p>Simple and relatively clean, execution by guillotine proves as humane as it is grisly. But when the PCs need to prevent such an execution, the rules and timing become more important.</p>\n<p><strong>By the Rules</strong>: Traps like the wall scythe detailed on page 420 of the <em>Core Rulebook </em>already provide rules for hurtling a significant mechanical blade at a hapless character. With the pillorylike restraint at the guillotine's bottom holding a character, the dropping blade essentially makes a strike against its victim's neck a coup de grace.</p>\n<p><strong>Extrapolation</strong>: One can easily treat a guillotine as a special kind of mechanical trap. Without the restraint, it might function exactly as a wall scythe trap. With the pillory, it becomes more deadly. Any creature in the pillory is considered helpless and so, the guillotine, when activated, makes a coup de grace attack against the victim-potentially causing death. If the guillotine strikes a killing blow, the victim is decapitated. If it fails, there has been some malfunction with the device, catching the blade part way through the pillory. A standard wooden pillory holds a character's head and both wrists. A character might slip free by spending 1 minute and succeeding at a DC 40 Escape Artist check.</p>\n<p><strong>Horror Considerations</strong>: A GM might use an even more horrific versions of the guillotine in which the creature it killed has its soul trapped within the lethal blade, preventing <em>resurrection</em>.</p>\n<h1>HANGING</h1>\n<p>Whether by the snapping of a neck or lengthy strangulation, hanging is a time-tested form of execution, and stories abound of heroes rescuing a victim in the nick of time.</p>\n<p><strong>By the Rules</strong>: Being hanged kills by either breaking the victim's neck or strangling the victim. Breaking the neck implies a quick, instant death from damage, like a coup de grace. Getting into a noose (and the DC for escaping it) would be covered by the tie up aspect of the grapple rules (<em>Core Rulebook </em>200). Strangulation suggests consulting the rules for suffocation (<em>Core Rulebook </em>445).</p>\n<p><strong>Extrapolation</strong>: How a PC might have wound up in a noose is up to the GM, but once he has, a few things might occur. If the execution involves a drop, the noose could deal 1d6 points of damage + 1d6 for every 5 feet he falls, to a maximum of 20d6. The victim is considered helpless, and this attack is treated as a coup de grace-requiring a successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + damage dealt) to avoid death. If the character has his hands free and uses them to hold on to the noose during the drop, he gains a +2 bonus on this saving throw.</p>\n<p>Once a character has survived the drop (or if one never occurred), his time is still limited as the noose chokes him to death. As the rules for tying someone up describe, a character can bind someone, creating a situation where the DC to escape such bonds is equal to 20 + the rope-tying character's CMB. This seems like a good way to set a DC for escaping a noose. A character can attempt to escape a noose, but doing so requires that his hands be free (otherwise, he must escape from those restraints first). Once they are, he can attempt to break the noose's \"grapple\" as detailed on page 200 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>. While dangling from a noose, a character is helpless.</p>\n<p><strong>Horror Considerations</strong>: A noose quickly turns into a lifeline when the ground is hundreds of feet below a struggling victim. Nooses made of chain or metal cord might also be more difficult to escape.</p>\n<h1>Improvisation Benchmarks</h1>\n<p>While encyclopedic knowledge of existing rules certainly helps with improvising new ones, it's not necessary by any means. The majority of the time, existing rules supply all the direction needed. In cases where they don't, don't worry! Almost everything in the Pathfinder RPG comes down to the roll of a d20. So the main questions are often simply how high to set a DC and what sort of bonus the PC should apply to it. While the latter is largely thematic and up to the GM's judgment, setting DCs can get a bit more technical. Fortunately, the likelihood of a too-high or too-low DC \"ruining\" an adventure is infinitesimal, especially when taking the following into account.</p>\n<p><strong>Custom DCs</strong>: Need to generate a DC for a specific situation on the fly? Look at tables like those for the Acrobatics, Bluff, Escape Artist, and other skills and extrapolate whether the challenge should be harder or easier based on the DC precedents there. GMs can find some great charts for ad-hoc DCs for parties of various levels in the sections on social conflicts and influence in <em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Intrigue</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Monster Statistics</strong>: Need something other than a DC? Table 1-1 on page 291 of the <em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </em>provides a wealth of level-appropriate benchmarks for creature hit points, Armor Class, damage, saving throw DCs, and more. These aren't just for monsters, though. Consider finding the party's level and using these statistics for any challenge required, increasing or decreasing the figures as necessary to adjust the difficulty.</p>\n<h1>THEMATIC CREEPINESS</h1>\n<p>Be it a misbehaving reflection, a whispering taxidermy, or a leering portrait, sometimes the most minor supernatural effect-noticeable as the subtlest feeling of wrongness- proves the most unsettling.</p>\n<p><strong>By the Rules</strong>: The rules for haunts allow GMs to generate practically infinite terrifying effects and create creepy but harmless encounters with which the players can interact.</p>\n<p><strong>Extrapolation</strong>: A purely thematic or otherwise harmless haunt probably shouldn't grant experience points and so shouldn't have a CR.</p>\n<p><strong>Horror Considerations</strong>: One doesn't have to bother with rules at all. GMs don't need to explain every thematic effect or unnerving embellishment, especially when these exist in the space between supernatural manifestations and the PCs' own uncertain observations. If a situation doesn't require hard-and-fast rules, a GM doesn't need to complicate things.</p>\n<p>^Running Horror Adventures Horror Gear and Magic Items</p>"}
